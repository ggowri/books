        <h1>Chapter 209 Battle</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave Maxine a reassuring look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he turned to Malcolm and said, "Since Maxine has sworn to marry no one but me, today, I have no reason to back down. I'm in this to the end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words shocked the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation in the room had clearly shifted entirely in Malcolm's favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Marcus' involvement seemed not only futile but also highly dangerous. He was risking his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could understand why Marcus would step forward now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew, Owen, Hazel, and Stella exchanged grateful looks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Marcus' intervention couldn't possibly change the outcome, his willingness to stand up for Maxine at such a crucial moment revealed his loyalty and deep sense of honor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, playing the hero now isn't the wisest choice. You'd better think carefully about the consequences you'll face!" Malcolm sneered and waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At once, the dozens of black-clad men turned their guns on Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A suffocating tension filled the entire banquet hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This fool has no idea what he's up against. Dad, why not just kill him now?" Arnold chuckled coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Malcolm took the position of family head, he would become the Burnett family's next successor!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm nodded in agreement, but before he could give the order, the crowd saw </span><span>Marcus</span><span> step forward, his body flashing like lightning until he was right in front of Malcolm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Malcolm even had time to react, Marcus had already seized his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Drop your weapons, or I'll snap his neck right here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes scanned the black-clad men, his voice cold and unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the room stood frozen in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't even seen how Marcus moved so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if he had teleported.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Malcolm felt Marcus' hand tightening around his throat, his face turned red from the pressure. He bellowed, "Let go of me! Let go of me now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While shouting, he subtly gave a signal to the warrior from the Astral Serpent Order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warrior slowly stood up from his seat and spoke, "I didn't expect to find someone like you here. From the looks of it, you're just a beginner. As long as I'm here, you won't have any chance to resist. If you want to live, release Mr. Malcolm Burnett, or I won't hesitate to make you regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Release him? Let's see if you have the ability to make me!" Marcus scoffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged warrior was at the Ancient Martial Stage Three, and from his aura, </span><span>he was much stronger than Ricardo, whom Marcus had killed earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after his recent cultivation, Marcus' strength had increased considerably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cultivation level now matched the middle-aged </span><span>warrior's</span><span>, and with the power of a Wizard and the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, Marcus could easily crush him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had intentionally suppressed his aura, causing the warrior to mistakenly believe he was a mere novice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're truly impossible to reason with. In that case, I'll have to kill you!" The middle-aged warrior's eyes flared with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Summoning his Numinous Energy, he instantly launched a devastating palm strike toward Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The palm strike was terrifying, blocking out the sky and seemingly engulfing Marcus in an instant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd </span><span>gasped,</span><span> their faces full of fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For most of them, this was the first time witnessing an actual warrior's attack, and they couldn't help but tremble with excitement and dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such scenes were usually reserved for movies, and never in their wildest dreams did they think they'd see it in real life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in the face of such a fearsome attack, Marcus stood unmoving, his expression calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was still calm and showed no signs of evading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying palm strike, accompanied by a chilling wind, descended upon him like a flash of lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Celestial Reversal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the exact moment the strike was about to hit Marcus, he uttered these words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, his body was enveloped in golden light, creating a barrier that separated him from the space around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, a powerful force of rebound shot out from Marcus, sending the warrior's palm strike hurtling back toward him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strike now rebounded and didn't lose its power. In fact, it became even more terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged warrior's expression twisted in horror, and he tried to dodge, but it was too late!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thunderous crash filled the air as the palm strike collided with him, sending him flying backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smashed into the banquet hall's wall, leaving a massive impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire hall shook, and the wall cracked open, sending a wave of fear through everyone.</span></p></div>
