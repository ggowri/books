  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She spoke to Marcus angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been a virgin for more than a hundred years, and Marcus in front of her took her virginity away!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes turned red, and she wished she could skin Marcus alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glancing at her oddly, Marcus said, "You seemed to be quite happy just now. Why do you want to kill me now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words made Silvia suddenly blush. She argued, "Don't talk nonsense. I wasn't happy. If you talk nonsense again, I will tear your mouth apart right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's said that Mary always says one thing and means another. It seems that you are no exception. You are enjoying my love-making and have gained great benefits out of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After that, not only did you not show any gratitude to me, but you even wanted to repay me with hatred. Mary indeed are no good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled. At the end of his words, he used a phrase that many Marys often liked to say, that is, all Rogers are bad!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he rephrased it from the other way around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words infuriated Silvia. She gritted her teeth and said, "I don't understand why you are so shameless. It was you who took away my virginity. How come I should be grateful to you in return? How can this be justified in the world!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you said you gave me some benefits, but I didn't see any. You are just talking nonsense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at her and said, "Please check your cultivation before you speak."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Silvia subconsciously checked her cultivation State</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she looked incredulous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My cultivation... my cultivation broke through to the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Nine. How is this possible? How is this possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had lived through a samsara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She has been practicing for more than a hundred years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the beginning, her cultivation went on relatively smoothly, and it was improving in an orderly manner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the further she went, the slower her advancement speed became.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Up to now, she hadn't made any breakthroughs in her cultivation for six or seven years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was thus so troubled. Her cousin, Ada, even surpassed her in terms of cultivation bit by bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never </span><span>thought that her cultivation would somehow break through after having sex with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, she reached the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It meant that she could now try to reach the Return Essence stage!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said sarcastically, "My nourishment made your cultivation make a breakthrough, for which you should be grateful to me, but you are scolding me instead. Tell me, are you an ungrateful Mary?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia naturally wasn't convinced. She couldn't help but say to him indifferently, "You are such a shameless pervert. This is the first time I heard that making love can make breakthroughs in cultivation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are trying to find an excuse for violating me. I won't buy your lies!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled nonchalantly, saying, "I am curious. What do you have that is worthy of me lying to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With your strength, even if I capture you and use you as a slave, you can't resist, let alone me taking you over once."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a pause, he continued, "Think about it yourself. Why did your cousin's cultivation have a breakthrough in a short period?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words seemed to wake Silvia up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Marcus deeply, she was in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said through gritted teeth, "No matter what, you violated me. One day, I must kill you to vent my anger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised his eyebrows slightly, stretched out his big hand, and pulled her delicate body in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia tried to break free with a look of vigilance on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she couldn't do it at all. She could only let Marcus hold her in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said blandly, "It seems that I didn't completely win you over before. In that case, let's do it again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Silvia could react, he kissed her.</span></p><div class="pagination">
