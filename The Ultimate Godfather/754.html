  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at this moment, Marcus spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raphael, Elliott, and the other figures all turned to look at Marcus in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can you, a human, save Nadia?" Elliott's gaze was sharp as he asked Marcus, his tone unfriendly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Once Nadia's situation is resolved, I must teach Susan a good lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this critical moment, she actually dared to bring such a person to cause trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have a way," Marcus said confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the people of the Nuer Tribe were conversing, Marcus had already used his X-ray vision to examine Nadia's condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He discovered that there was a certain evil Cursed Power within Nadia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Cursed Power had firmly locked onto Nadia's life force, causing her major organs to fail and putting her life in danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Susan had said before, this Cursed Power seemed to be innate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every member of the Nuer Tribe couldn't escape the bondage of the Cursed Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the influence of the Cursed Power, the people of the Nuer Tribe either lived in pain throughout their lives at the mildest, or like Nadia, would die of organ failure before the age of 20 at the worst.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through his exploration, Marcus could confirm that the Cursed Power was not something the Nuer Tribe carried by nature. Instead, someone had implanted the Cursed Power into the genes of the Nuer Tribe people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether it was the existing members of the Nuer Tribe or the newly-born babies, none could escape the fate of being cursed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It could be said that the person who implanted the Cursed Power into the genes of the Nuer Tribe people was extremely evil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although this person might not be among the Nuer Tribe, </span><span>he</span><span> </span><span>could firmly control the Nuer Tribe in this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the effect of the power, the people of the Nuer Tribe not only suffered from the torment of the illness but also had their own potential greatly restricted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the exploration of X-ray vision, Marcus could tell that the people of the Nuer Tribe should be a combination of some kind of underwater creature and humans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Genetically speaking, they should belong to the semi-orcs race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps because that underwater creature was also a high-level being, the Nuer Tribe usually presented in human form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And they still retained the genes of that high-level underwater creature in their bodies, which was why they all had horns on their foreheads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike warriors who relied on acquired cultivation, these high-level semi-orcs were born with special and magical powers, which were quite similar to metahumans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, due to their noble bloodlines, the potential of the people of the Nuer Tribe was much stronger than that of ordinary metahumans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, because the Cursed Power was implanted into the genes of the Nuer Tribe people, the magical powers they should have possessed by nature were completely sealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, the strongest person in the Nuer Tribe currently, Raphael, only had the cultivation equivalent to that of a human Ancient Martial Stage Eight expert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's strength was a bit weaker, equivalent to that of an Ancient Martial Stage Seven expert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for young people like Susan, they were even weaker, only equivalent to an Ancient Martial Stage Four expert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to the limitation of the Cursed Power, the overall strength of the Nuer Tribe was only comparable to some of the aristocratic families in the world of Ancient Martial Art in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the restriction of the cursed could be lifted, the potential of the Nuer Tribe would be completely released, and their strength would surely become even stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even Ashton is at his wit's end. I don't believe the human has a way. Mr. Stewart, this human is just talking nonsense. It's better to lock him up as soon as possible!" A high-ranking member of the Nuer Tribe immediately objected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people nodded in agreement, looking at Marcus with hostility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The older man with a bushy beard was Ashton Reynolds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashton sneered at Marcus and said, "I've been practicing medicine in the Nuer Tribe for many years and have treated the strange diseases of the Nuer Tribe people all my life, yet I'm helpless when it comes to Nadia. You actually claim to have a way. You're just boasting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, the people of the Nuer Tribe all laughed mockingly. No one believed Marcus' words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You said you've treated the strange diseases of the Nuer Tribe people all your life. Who have you cured?" Marcus sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Ashton blushed with shame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was angry, but Marcus' words were irrefutable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, he had treated this strange disease all his life. At most, he could only relieve the pain of the patients, but he had never completely cured anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Ashton himself suffered from this disease, and he had no better way to solve his own condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Stewart, this human is just boasting. I don't believe his medical skills can be better than my father's. We should lock him up quickly to prevent him from misleading people here!" Ashton's son, </span><span>Lionel Reynolds</span><span>, said with a disdainful look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several people from the Nuer Tribe prepared to drive Marcus out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Susan shielded Marcus behind her and said, "Since Ashton is already helpless with Nadia, why not let Marcus give it a try? What if Marcus really has a way to treat Nadia?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lionel sneered, "Susan, you actually believe him. Are you dating this guy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he deliberately sized up Susan's perfect figure greedily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was about the same age as Susan and had always been coveting Susan's beauty, but Susan wasn't interested in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made him harbor some resentment towards Susan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Lionel's words, Susan blushed and said, "Marcus and I are just friends. Don't talk nonsense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lionel was about to speak when Raphael said, "Let the human try as Susan said. If he dares to play any tricks, we'll punish him later!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Raphael had made the decision, no one dared to say more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashton and Lionel both showed sneers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost no one among the other Nuer Tribe people was optimistic about Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't hold out hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "Nadia's illness seemed to have no value in treatment anymore, so it wouldn't hurt to let this human have a try."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, treat Nadia with peace of mind. Even if you can't succeed in the treatment, I'll try my best to keep you safe," Susan came up to Marcus and comforted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked at her and felt touched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had accidentally seen her naked before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did Susan not hate him, but she also trusted him so much, which showed that Susan was kind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded gently to Susan, then walked to the bedside of Nadia and quickly activated the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.</span></p><div class="pagination">
