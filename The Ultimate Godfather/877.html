With Benjamin's release, this trip to Kingston had been a complete success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus returned to the hotel, he found that Jade was still sleeping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until 4:00 in the afternoon that she finally woke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did you sleep? Should we head back to </span><span>Solomia</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked, suddenly feeling an eagerness to return home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade rubbed her sleepy eyes, glanced at the sky outside, and said, "Let's take the evening flight back to </span><span>Solomia</span><span> then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded slightly and immediately booked the tickets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the plane landed, Jade received a call from the </span><span>Solomia</span><span> Hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she had already been appointed as the deputy director, she had not yet officially assumed the position and was still responsible for her duties as the head of surgery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A patient with severe trauma from a fall had just arrived at the hospital and required immediate surgery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment she got off the plane, Jade hurriedly took a taxi straight to </span><span>Solomia</span><span> Hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, on the other hand, returned to Bayside Villa alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as he was about to enter the courtyard, a shadow flickered in the void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This shadow had no physical form, only an energy fluctuation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone else would have been completely unable to detect its presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus, as an Acquired Return Essence Realm Stage Two expert, had cultivated the Hidden State, making his strength comparable to that of a Stage Four expert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the additional enhancement of various cultivation manuals, his combat prowess even surpassed most Stage Four experts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the very beginning of his cultivation, Marcus had placed great emphasis on spiritual powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, his spiritual power was stronger than those of others with the same combat level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By his estimation, his spiritual power was already on par with an Acquired Return Essence Realm Stage Six expert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, even though the shadow was extremely well-concealed, Marcus detected it instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus locked onto the figure's presence with his piercing gaze, swiftly unleashing his spiritual power to restrain the intruder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the shadow remained silent, flickering ceaselessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't speak, I won't hold back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes turned cold. The Timeless Warrior's Grimoire began to operate at full force, and strands of Timeless Numinous Energy gathered in his palm, ready to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Marcus' warning, the figure finally ceased its movement, hovering motionlessly in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the shadow gradually became solid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Marcus get a clear look at the stranger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a cloaked figure, emanating a mysterious glow. A wide-brimmed hat covered its head, obscuring its face in a blur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the gentle aura surrounding it, there was an inexplicable depth to its presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you, and why are you lingering here?" Marcus demanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did he know that this figure had appeared before, after one of his previous battles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that this being had always existed in this world, simply unnoticed by most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calm yourself, I mean no harm," the figure finally spoke, its voice strange and indistinguishable in gender. "I arrived in this world by accident and have been unable to return."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You mean... you don't belong to this world?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
