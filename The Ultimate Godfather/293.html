  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you feeling better, Mr. Fitzgerald?" Diana's concerned voice came from the doorway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus opened his room door and stepped out, looking radiant with eighty percent recovery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm fine," he replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana let out a long breath, relief washing over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had been anxious during the three days of his recovery, struggling to eat or sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing him well again brought a bright smile to her stunning face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "I'm glad to hear that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How is the gun remodeling going? Can you show me?" Marcus asked, eager to see the progress, as it was crucial for his plans to build a force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana nodded, and they made their way to the villa's backyard, where dozens of guns were neatly arranged on a large table, each emitting energy fluctuations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Upon closer inspection, Marcus noticed energy crystals the size of nails embedded in the guns, each colored differently to represent various attributes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He picked up a gun and pulled the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Swoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A bullet shot out, radiating destructive energy, directly falling on a boulder not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the sound of a crack, the boulder was directly beaten apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, please don't shoot again. It might disturb the neighbors," Diana hurriedly cautioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was the villa area, and the noise just now had been quite loud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus scratched his head in embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The firearm was indeed more powerful than the ones Diana had remodeled before, likely due to the higher-grade energy crystals embedded in them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the energy crystals were more than twice as small as before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm impressed. Keep up the good work," Marcus said with a laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Remodeling isn't an issue, but I need you to bring me some more guns. Also, these energy crystals aren't permanent. After a period of use, they'll be exhausted, and it is necessary to replace them," Diana explained, adjusting her hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow. "I will try to get a batch of guns. How long do they last?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They should last about three months during a large-scale battle," Diana replied casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then Marcus had nothing to worry about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't intend to launch any large-scale battles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was primarily focused on strengthening his forces for deterrence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if there was a conflict, it should remain local.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Compared to large-scale battles, this was merely a minor issue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, the energy crystals reserved for these guns should last over a year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he went to southeast Uswad for crystals next time, it would be for new gun upgrades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for replacing the second batch of energy crystals, there was no need to worry for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that in mind, he called Maxine. "Hello, Officer Burnett!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's up? Why the formal title?" Maxine's cold voice responded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh, no, Baby Maxine, is that better?" Marcus quickly corrected himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Please drop the 'baby'!" Maxine replied with a hint of fluster in her tone. No one had ever called her that, which made her heartbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What? I'm your fianc&eacute; recognized by the Burnett family. Can't I call you that? Are you falling for someone else?" Marcus teased, enjoying her reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The unsmiling appearance of Maxine could stimulate Marcus' desire to conquer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Enough with the flirting. If you called for a reason, just say it," Maxine said, trying to sound impatient but unable to hide her amusement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I need a batch of guns. Do you have access?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maxine frowned. "I don't have that kind of access."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Aren't you a police officer? How can you not get guns?" Marcus pressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just because I'm a police officer doesn't mean I'm selling arms! What do you think I am?" Maxine retorted, rolling her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Seriously, what do you need guns for? Planning a rebellion?" she added, half-joking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm a good citizen! I wouldn't rebel," Marcus laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Guns are usually sold on the black market or smuggled in," Maxine explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The black market guns are outdated and limited in power. Do you know how to smuggle them in?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it was the kind of gun in the black market, he could acquire plenty from the Serpent's Coil.</span></p><div class="pagination">
