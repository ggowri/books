        <h1>Chapter 920 Thank You-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then she saw Yasser step forward to Marcus, bow down to him, and say with a face full of gratitude and respect, "Sir, thank you for passing on your skills and teachings and helping my fianc&eacute;e improve her cultivation. I, Yasser Tucker, will never forget your great kindness!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser's behavior made Marcus' eyebrows twitch slightly, and he felt a bit awkward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Passing on skills and teachings?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, he had passed something to Gertie just now, but it was in a rather different sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then he thought that Gertie's breakthrough in cultivation was indeed related to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Marcus waved his hand at Yasser and said, "You're welcome. Gertie and I are friends. This is just a small favor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus putting on an act as a senior master, Gertie gritted her teeth in hatred. If eyes could kill, Marcus would have died countless times by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never seen such a shameless man in her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took advantage of her, yet he had the nerve to say such things. What a shameless bastard!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser was kept in the dark and had no idea what had happened in the illusion rune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Marcus say that he was friends with Gertie, Yasser looked even more excited. "I'm truly happy for Gertie that she can become friends with someone as powerful as you. I thank you again for your great kindness!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Devon, Yasser's senior, bowed to Marcus in gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus cleared his throat awkwardly and waved his hands at the two of them, saying, "You don't have to thank me. It's just a small thing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser looked at Marcus. Besides gratitude, there was also curiosity and shock in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus seemed to be only in his early twenties, but his strength must be extremely profound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason was simple. He had previously tried to scan Marcus' body with his spiritual senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus' body seemed to be covered by an invisible film. No matter how he scanned, he couldn't figure out the other person's specific cultivation state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a person was either an ordinary person without cultivation or an expert much more powerful than him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser preferred to believe that Marcus was the latter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since Gertie has already joined you, I won't stay and bother you. Farewell," Marcus said to Yasser.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying these words, to show off his power, Marcus activated his teleport technique. Surrounded by a burst of spatial light, his body completely disappeared!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That scene made Yasser and Devon widen their eyes in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could feel that Marcus didn't use a spatial amulet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It meant that Marcus had mastered such a miraculous technique. Throughout the entire world of Ancient Martial Art in Uswad, it seemed that no one else had achieved this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Gertie was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she appeared in front of Marcus, she used a spatial amulet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she made a dramatic entrance, she knew that it wasn't the power of her own body but came from the spatial amulet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus was different. He achieved the effect of a spatial amulet with his own strength alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, what level of strength had he reached?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie couldn't help but feel a sense of despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was such a powerful being. Would she still have a chance to get revenge?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't care about that. His Aston Martin was still parked on the mountaintop. To show off, he used the teleport technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, after Yasser, Gertie, and the others left, he would send someone to drive the car back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gertie, tell me. How did you get to know that man?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Marcus left, Yasser asked Gertie with a curious look on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Embarrassed, Gertie forced a smile and said, "Ada introduced him to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ada? She actually knows such a powerful being. I haven't heard her mention it before!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser muttered to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After reuniting with Gertie, the group returned together to the Tucker family that lived deep in the Kinton Mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the way, Yasser was still very curious about how Gertie had broken through her cultivation. He asked, "Gertie, how did that man help you break through your cultivation? Can you tell me?"</span></p></div>
