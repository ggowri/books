  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was handsome, while the woman looked like a model, strikingly beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tall, sexy figure gave off an especially alluring vibe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't recognize these two people, so he asked, "Who are you looking for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man and woman simultaneously bowed deeply to Marcus, their faces showing expressions of deep respect as they said, "Good morning, Mr. Fitzgerald!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing th</span><span>at</span><span>, Marcus became even more surprised and curious, so he asked, "I don't know either of you. What's this all about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man and woman stood tall, and the woman flashed Marcus a charming smile. "It's perfectly understandable that Mr. Fitzgerald doesn't recognize us. We're from Royal Entertainment. I'm Callista Royce, the executive assistant to the chairman, and this is Evander Bishop, the Executive Vice President of Royal Entertainment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued, "</span><span>You</span><span> recently acquired 100% equity in Royal Entertainment, </span><span>becoming</span><span> the sole controlling shareholder. The main reason for our visit today is to invite </span><span>you</span><span> to attend the Luminara Awards tomorrow afternoon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She explained, "Royal Entertainment is hosting this prestigious event, and if the actual controlling shareholder doesn't appear, it could invite criticism and damage Royal Entertainment's dominant position in the Uswad entertainment industry. That's why we took the liberty of coming unannounced. We hope Mr. Fitzgerald will forgive </span><span>us</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus immediately understood their intentions upon hearing this explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some time ago, he had eliminated Zachary, the previous head of Royal Entertainment, and invested funds to bring the company under his control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as the actual controlling shareholder of Royal Entertainment, he had never made a public appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Essentially, Royal Entertainment was currently </span><span>leaderless</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reflecting on this, Marcus felt somewhat ashamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Royal Entertainment was now part of his business empire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hands-off approach had definitely been negligent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come in and have a seat." Marcus gestured invitingly to Callista and Evander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The honor overwhelmed the pair, immediately expressing their gratitude to Marcus as they entered the villa's courtyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Callista and Evander knew that someone like Marcus&mdash;a heavyweight who had effortlessly acquired 100% of Royal Entertainment's shares&mdash;was typically an elusive figure who maintained a certain air of superiority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mere fact that he allowed them into his yard was an enormous privilege that left them feeling incredibly honored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How has Royal Entertainment been lately?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Zachary's death, Royal Entertainment had been without leadership for some time, and he hadn't paid much attention to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only now, with these two visitors arriving, did he think to inquire about the company's operational status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To be perfectly honest with you, Mr. Fitzgerald, Royal Entertainment has experienced quite a turbulent period since Mr. Walsh's unexpected passing," Callista explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even with your financial backing, Mr. Fitzgerald, Royal Entertainment's business has shrunk dramatically, and our stock has plummeted. Many investors have withdrawn funding, and numerous film projects have been shut down. However, since Mr. Bishop joined us, </span><span>things</span><span> ha</span><span>ve</span><span> improved significantly over the past two months. Royal Entertainment's business has almost reached its peak, and everything is gradually getting back on track."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evander quickly waved his hand, humbly saying, "Please don't say that, Ms. Royce. Royal Entertainment's return to the top is</span><span> team</span><span> efforts</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>You gave us too much credit</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Callista replied, "But you're the one who stepped up when Royal Entertainment was in its darkest hour. Your contribution is the greatest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evander said, "Even if I've made contributions, Royal Entertainment can't go a day without leadership. For some major occasions, Mr. Fitzgerald still needs to take charge of the situation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Callista handed Royal Entertainment's recent financial statements to Marcus for his review.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After flipping through them, Marcus discovered everything was exactly as Callista had described.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to Zachary's unexpected death and the complete transfer of shares, Royal Entertainment had gone through a turbulent period.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the past month, this situation had clearly improved, and the business showed trends of surpassing its former peak period.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've done very well. What's your current annual salary?" Marcus asked, putting down the financial reports and fixing his gaze on Evander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I am flattered</span><span>, Mr. Fitzgerald. My current annual salary is five million dollars," Evander replied respectfully, appearing modest, reasonable, and refined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just by his appearance alone, he could make an excellent impression on Marcus.</span></p><div class="pagination">
