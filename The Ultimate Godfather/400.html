        <h1>Chapter 399 Break His Arms</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing these words, Scales couldn't help but widen his eyes, with shock and disbelief on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He found it difficult to accept Marcus' position in Golden Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unexpectedly, even Serpent's Coil would be so respectful to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sheila was also dumbfounded, and suddenly, she remembered what Catherine had just reminded her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, she didn't believe it at all, thinking that Catherine said that because she was afraid that Marcus would suffer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now Sheila finally understood that every word Catherine had said was not an exaggeration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catherine was telling the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone in Solomia knew that Serpent's Coil was the leading gang. It had a very wide sphere of influence, many industries, and was very powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But even such a gang had to be respectful to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus was no longer accessible to ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You two go over there and break his arms. Then chop off his feet as well." Toby angrily gave orders to his two subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two men nodded and stepped forward to control Scales.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Scales was so frightened that his face turned pale. He never dreamed that he would face such a situation today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sheila begged Catherine with a sad face, "Catherine, stop them. You can't chop off Scales' arms. If that happens, he will not be able to work. How can we live?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catherine was a kind girl who didn't want to see others so miserable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had just reminded Sheila, but Sheila didn't listen at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instead, Sheila also insisted on asking Toby to come over and cut off Marcus' arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, Catherine was completely disappointed with Sheila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She also knew that Scales had offended Marcus. Even if she pleaded for him, Marcus might not let Scales go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So she chose to ignore Sheila's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Almost at the same time, the crowd heard a muffled sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A man swung a machete, and Scales' right hand was cut off. Blood spurted out, and the scene was horrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this scene, all the people were so frightened that their bodies were shaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those who had said insulting words to Marcus before didn't dare to say anything, afraid that they would be the next ones to suffer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Scales' face was pale. Sweat was flowing down his forehead, and he kept screaming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at his severed arm, he was filled with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But before he could react, his left hand was also chopped off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The intense pain made Scales wail in agony, his eyes filled with despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then the two men chopped off Scales' two feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The entire floor of the box was stained red with blood, looking bloody.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Scales had his limbs cut off and had to spend the rest of his life in bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was silent, feeling difficulty breathing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby came in front of Marcus and said respectfully, "Mr. Fitzgerald, I didn't know that he wanted to hit you. If I knew, I would not dare to offend you. Please forgive me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus glanced at Toby and said, "Didn't I tell you before that you must ask for the other party's information in detail when accepting a mission? Why didn't you listen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His tone was calm, but it made Toby's body tremble uncontrollably. He said pleadingly, "Mr. Fitzgerald, I won't dare to do it again. Please forgive me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus waved his hand at Toby. "Go ahead. If you do this again, I will kill you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Receiving Marcus' forgiveness, Toby thanked him quickly and then left the box with his subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one dared to speak, and all looked at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus stood up from his chair, looking at Scales and Sheila. "I wanted to attend this class reunion quietly with Catherine, but you two have been mocking and suppressing me since we met.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't understand why you are so confident. Do you think you can do whatever you want just because you've achieved some success in your field?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As I said, there are always people who are better than you, so don't be too arrogant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Marcus took Catherine's hand and left Room 206 of Kirkland Hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone present was in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What happened today made them realize what it means that there were always people better than them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus, the most inconspicuous person present, actually dominated the Golden Group and was respected by all the people from Serpent's Coil.</span></p></div>
