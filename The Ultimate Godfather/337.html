        <h1>Chapter 336 Slaying Wizards</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine couldn't comprehend it. The handgun she had just used was the latest model, capable of firing larger-caliber bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its power was no less than that of the newest submachine guns from Acoton.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, even so, her shots against the cyborgs felt like mere tickles to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was completely ineffective.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus' weapon was different. Two shots were enough to destroy a cyborg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was overwhelmingly powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaun and Aiton were dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could never have imagined that the cyborgs they had prided themselves on were so pitifully weak against Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With just a few casual shots, he had annihilated them. The destructive power of his weapon was absurd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you have any more tricks, you'd better use them now. You won't get another chance," he taunted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair painted Shaun's and Aiton's faces. They had no cards left to play.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Useless fools, step aside. I'll take him on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp voice suddenly came from the distant horizon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, two figures emerged from the forest nearby, their movements swift and precise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They radiated immense magical power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Removing their hats, they coldly looked at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus could feel that they were both wizards at level four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their magical power was solid and intense, clearly honed over years of practice. They were not far from breaking into level five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha-ha! I knew Mr. Roger Gellar wouldn't just sit by," Shaun laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrival of the two wizards meant his life was saved and Marcus' death was imminent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiton was equally excited. He recognized the two wizards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were associates of Roger and very powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Either of them could easily destroy his eight cyborgs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Together, they were invincible, even against Marcus' weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine panicked, not expecting such formidable foes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though she didn't know much about wizards, she could tell the two were far from ordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you here to die?" Marcus remained unflustered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at the two wizards and stowed his weapon back into his storage ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're as arrogant as the rumors suggest," one of the wizards sneered. "Don't think that killing a few nobodies gives you the right to challenge us. Facing us, you're doomed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their investigation had shown Marcus to be at the Ancient Martial Stage Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he could fight above his level, he couldn't beat them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had no interest in exchanging words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bolt of lightning erupted from his hand, splitting into two as it shot toward their heads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two wizards frowned, not expecting Marcus to strike first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They swiftly dodged to the side, narrowly avoiding the lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a roar, they retaliated, unleashing powerful fireballs that streaked toward Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air sizzled as the temperature soared, the fire seemingly capable of melting everything in its path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boy, Mr. Roger Gellar send us two powerful wizards to kill you. You could die with honor," one of them smirked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He channeled his magic to its peak, aiming to obliterate Marcus in a single strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that all you've got?" Marcus chuckled disdainfully, making no move to dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he threw a punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like an ordinary punch, but within it roared the Thunderfire Power and the Timeless Numinous Energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fusion of these forces brought the punch's power to an unprecedented peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deafening explosion resounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' punch shattered the incoming fireballs instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of retreating, he used the Shadow Step to advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His figure blurred, turning into countless shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he appeared before one of the wizards, his fist blazing with terrifying energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wizard was taken aback and hastily conjured a defensive spell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, an even more terrifying shockwave rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' punch tore through the wizard's defense and slammed into his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wizard screamed as his body was flung back like a cannonball, blood gushing from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time he hit the ground, his internal organs had been pulverized. He was dead.</span></p></div>
