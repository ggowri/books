        <h1>Chapter 296 Hospitalization</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Allan drove with a smug look on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wasn't a bad guy, and he just enjoyed the feeling of being flattered by others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So Allan said, "Lisa's right. That doctor is my friend, and we're pretty close. I just need to tell him that he will definitely treat Nick."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick and Aria immediately smiled with satisfaction upon hearing that, "That's great. Allan is awesome!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lisa felt even more proud to be praised by her parents. "Of course. You should praise your daughter's great taste in getting a man like Allan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, my daughter has been the pride of the Fitzgerald family since she came of age, and we've never been disappointed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick nodded in a hurry. Lisa was not only his pride but also the pride of their village.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though Lisa hadn't been to college, she was one of the few young people in their village who could work in the big city and earn a good living.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick's eyes fell on Marcus without him realizing it, and he couldn't help but sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted to say something, but he swallowed it back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus made Richard and his family live in a big villa, but Nick always thought it was shameful to marry into a woman's family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought Marcus should be sorry for his family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, Marcus was nothing compared to Lisa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick had told Richard this a long time ago, but Richard wouldn't listen to him, so Nick ignored him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus, when your dad and I were hospitalized last time, the doctor you got for us was the director, right? Also, he was so polite to you and gave us a VIP ward. How about you give Nick a VIP ward?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was as if Melinda was thinking about the last time they were hospitalized after being kidnapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melinda was being kind and didn't mean to show off in any way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was completely trying to get Nick better treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Nick was the brother of Melinda's husband. They had so many years of kinship, so of course, she wished Nick well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Right, Marcus. You can contact the hospital and arrange a VIP ward for Nick. The normal ward is so messy that it will bother him to rest," Nick chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Allan and Lisa clearly didn't believe them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lisa said, "As far as I know, Solomia Hospital is one of the top ten hospitals in Uswad. Not to mention VIP wards, even general wards are in short supply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So many patients have to wait in line to go to the doctor who needs to be hospitalized. Uncle Richard, Aunt Melinda, I know you want Marcus to be well, but you have to be realistic in what you say."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lisa had tried to put it as politely as possible, and she just didn't want to hurt the relationship between the relatives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Lisa is right. Solomia Hospital is so popular that patients from three surrounding states come here for medical treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My friend is a doctor, but he can't even get a VIP ward. Even if we pay extra, we can't even register, or else I would like to get Nick a VIP ward. After all, it's a better environment for him to get better rest," Allan also said the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Allan and Lisa not believing her, Melinda wanted to continue explaining, but she saw Marcus waving his hand at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had already decided what they thought, and it was useless for Melinda to explain it any further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Melinda explained more, they would think she was lying instead, using the story to cover up the lies she had told earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Allan parked his Sienna commercial vehicle in the parking lot of Solomia Hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had to wait in line to get into the parking lot because there were so many patients to see the doctor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Besides, he had been in line for at least half an hour or more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Melinda, I remember the last time Marcus took us to the doctor, and we went straight into the underground parking lot without waiting in line, so what happened today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Richard asked in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I saw that parking lot that said VIP ward exclusive, so we didn't have to wait in line," Melinda said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Allan and Lisa smiled without saying anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They thought, "Uncle Richard and Aunt Melinda are so good at acting, and they even know that the VIP ward has exclusive parking spaces. How did they learn that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Did Marcus teach them in advance?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's quite possible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Allan finally got a parking space, he stopped the car and wasted over forty minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they got out of the car, they all stood still and took deep breaths, just feeling out of breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick felt even more dizzy and almost fainted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dad, are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lisa helped Nick immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick looked pale. "I feel a bit dizzy. Maybe I'd been in the car for too long."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've contacted my friend. Hurry up and take Nick inside," Allan said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They rushed to help Nick into the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unexpectedly, they had to wait in line to register, and they were also going to the specialist clinic in line.</span></p></div>
