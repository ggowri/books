        <h1>Chapter 595 My Place</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rising Logistics Company was the main income source for William and Tim. They certainly wouldn't let other companies suppress it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary said to Tim, "Mr. Burton, this bastard obstructed us. I told him who was the boss of Rising Logistics Company, but he ignored it and dared mock you. Mr. Burton, show your means and teach him a lesson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary pointed at Marcus. His face distorted with fury and pain, and his hatred for Marcus became even stronger, so his words inevitably exaggerated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim looked at Marcus up and down. "Brat, you are so bold to snatch my business at my place. You are courting death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your place? You mean, Solomia is your place, right?" Marcus sneered, with a hint of sarcasm in his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the way Tim spoke, Marcus could tell that he was aggressive. Tim must have abused his power and status to bully others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim said arrogantly, "My dad is the director of the Department of Transportation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh?" The mockery on Marcus' face became even stronger. "Is </span><span>he</span><span> a high-ranking official?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim frowned, "It's more than enough to deal with a nobody like you. My father even has a wide connection in Kingston."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sneered, "Well, I really want to see how powerful your father is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus still being so arrogant in front of Tim, Gary said, "Mr. Burton, don't waste time talking to this jerk. Beat him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim nodded and glanced at the person from the office of the Industrial and Commercial Administration behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officer immediately stepped forward and said to Marcus and Darian, "Your logistics company doesn't meet the approval procedures of the Industrial and Commercial Administration. You are required to suspend business for rectification. The specific rectification time is to be determined."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the officer spoke, he handed a document to Darian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the official seal, Darian felt hopeless. It was indeed a document from the Industrial and Commercial Administration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this way, Darian Logistics Company was suspended for rectification before it officially opened for business, and all the previous hard work was in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darian felt upset. Ramona, Kiera, and some managers of Darian Logistics Company also looked depressed. They knew that Tim was going to take action against the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph, this is what happens when you go against Mr. Burton. The game has just begun. If you anger him again, you won't be able to survive in Solomia," Gary said with a sneer, looking very smug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim snorted, "This bastard dares to steal my business. He is so bold."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked calm. He didn't even glance at Tim and Gary. Instead, he turned to ask the officer, "The Industrial and Commercial Administration approved the</span><span> </span><span>documents of Darian Logistics Company. But just now, you said that the company's approval procedures didn't meet the conditions. Which of your statements is correct?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several officers from the Industrial and Commercial Administration looked at each other and didn't know what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, an officer said, "It's the official notification. You have no right to doubt or reject."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The director of the Industrial and Commercial Administration and William had been friends for many years. Before Tim and those people came here, William had asked the director for help in advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, these officers came there with Tim under the director's order. Naturally, they had to finish the task well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim looked at Marcus and said arrogantly, "Stop struggling in vain. As I said before, you are no match for me in Solomia. I have hundreds of ways to kill you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your logistics company can open, but you have to meet a few of my conditions. First, I want 70% of Darian Logistics Company's profits. Second, the company must be under my management.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Third, I want the two girls behind you to accompany me tonight. It has been a long time since I've had three play with two sisters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Tim spoke, he stared at Marcus with a smug look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The price of Darian Logistics Company was reasonable, and its profits had already reached the limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Tim actually wanted to take away 70% of the profits. He didn't want Darian Logistics Company to survive at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, before this, Tim had used the same way to ruin several newly opened logistics companies.</span></p></div>
