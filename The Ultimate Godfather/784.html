  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few beads of sweat popped onto Marcus' forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Girls from the underwater tribe were definitely different from human girls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They expressed every emotion bluntly, even something like courtship, laying it all out in the open without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was refreshing, in a way, but took Marcus by surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to... give yourself to me," he began, trying to find the right words, "but only with Susan there? And in her room?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia's eyes flickered. "Because Susan wants to... share you with me, Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nearly dropped his jaw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Up until now, only Jane had ever made such a bold suggestion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Jane was a woman in her thirties, and well, she was known for being rather... forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her desires were hardly typical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, she and Marcus had known each other for a while before she made that kind of proposition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But these two girls? Barely out of their teens, still practically blossoming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And here they were, stating this... intimate desire so casually. That was the difference between humans and the people of the deep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were direct, yes, but also undeniably genuine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No beating around the bush, no hidden agendas. They said exactly what was on their minds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald," Nadia asked, a hint of disappointment creeping into her stunning features as Marcus remained silent. "Are you... repulsed by me? Do you think I'm not beautiful enough?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus immediately shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia was, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful women he'd ever laid eyes on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he think she wasn't attractive?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was practically an angel, a real-life vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than that, even&mdash;with a blend of innocent allure and raw sensuality that was utterly captivating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A single glance was enough to leave a man breathless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then... Mr. Fitzgerald," Nadia continued, her eyes starting to well up, "do you think </span><span>we're being... too forward?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan chimed in, "Mr. Fitzgerald, please don't misunderstand. It's because we admire you so much, we... care for you deeply. We want to give you the very best of ourselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's just how we express our feelings in our tribe. Maybe it seems... uninhibited to you humans." Susan paused, then added with sincerity, "But if we're with you, we're yours for life. Our passion, our openness... it will only ever be for you. We would never behave this way with another man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the genuine emotion in both girls' faces, a wave of warmth washed over Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that if he rejected them, this night could very well become a source of deep insecurity for them, a wound they'd carry with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus seemed to have given his tacit consent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, the two girls simultaneously unfastened their jumpsuits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The silky fabric slid down their bodies, pooling at their feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stood naked before Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both women were stunning, practically flawless in every way&mdash;face, figure, bearing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Classic beauties, each with her own distinct allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan exuded a poised elegance, while Nadia was gentle and sweet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each was breathtaking in her own right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, they had decided to offer themselves to Marcus, together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight before him set his blood on fire. A heat surged through his lower abdomen, and his cock hardened instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost at the same moment, Nadia began to walk towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Completely naked, her bare feet padding softly against the floor, her full, round breasts swaying with each step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dark curls below her flat stomach parted slightly with her movement, revealing a glistening hint of moisture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The raw visual impact sent jolts of electricity through Marcus' senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could react, Nadia was in his arms, taking his hand and placing it on one of her firm, upturned breasts. The immediate sensation made him throb even harder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia pressed her lips to his, and Marcus inhaled her youthful scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lifted her easily and carried her to the nearby bed, lowering her gently onto the soft surface before leaning down to kiss her deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Mmm</span><span>..." Nadia murmured, the electric charge of their kiss sending shivers through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they kissed, an image flashed through her mind&mdash;Marcus making love to Ada.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene was vividly real&mdash;Marcus' tanned skin, the hard lines of his body, all crystal clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vision ignited a fire within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two orgasms she'd already experienced had brought pleasure, but that pleasure had quickly given way to a gnawing emptiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with Marcus' kisses, that emptiness only intensified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moistness returned between her legs, a deep yearning to be filled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' hand teased her nipples, while his other hand slipped between her legs, into the slick heat between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fingers found the sensitive nub buried deep within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The touch sent waves of pleasure through her; even the slightest pressure made her tremble and gasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took one of her nipples into his mouth, his tongue flicking across the hard peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sensation only deepened the ache within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She instinctively spread her long, pale legs, offering him a clear view of the glistening folds between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia, at only eighteen, possessed a youthful freshness. The delicate folds between her legs were a soft pink, perfectly shaped, radiating a raw, youthful energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald... am I beautiful?" she asked, her eyes heavy with desire as she gazed at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," Marcus replied, nodding almost automatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia continued, "If I'm beautiful, Mr. Fitzgerald, then please... take me. I can't stand it anymore!" Her voice was thick with longing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, his own desire now overwhelming, quickly stripped off his clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grasped his erection, positioning it at the entrance of her moist opening, and slowly began to push inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah... that hurts..." Nadia gasped as a sharp tearing sensation shot through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain was almost unbearable, making her head swim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she gritted her teeth and held on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan had told her the tearing wouldn't last, that it would soon give way to intense pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Susan was right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus moved in and out, the pain quickly subsided, replaced by a rising tide of sensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each thrust seemed to find a new nerve ending within her, drawing soft moans from her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Marcus with undisguised desire, her hands gripping his waist, her legs spread wide, as if begging him to reach even deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald... you're so big..." She </span><span>breathed,</span><span> her voice filled with awe. "Just like Susan said... so powerful. I feel so full... Please, fuck me harder. I want to feel... that ultimate high!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, eager to fulfill her desires, summoned his Dual Cultivation energy and began to thrust with greater force and intensity.</span></p><div class="pagination">
