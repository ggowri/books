        <h1>Chapter 731 Don't Mention It Again</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley and Natalie were both stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed they had underestimated Marcus' status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To get Marcus' forgiveness, Noel, the young master of the Ortega family, actually went as far as publicly licking his shoes in such a humbling manner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This clearly showed that he had been pushed to a corner. Otherwise, someone with Noel's character would never have done such a thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noel gagged repeatedly while he continued licking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the experience was revolting, Noel dared not slack off for a second, fearing Marcus' displeasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcus wasn't satisfied, all of Noel's previous efforts would be in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After nearly twenty minutes of licking, Noel finally stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rushed to one side and began vomiting uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to Hadley, he shouted, "You worthless woman, why are you still standing there? Hurry up and get me some water!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley quickly ran over and gave Noel a bottle of water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rinsed his mouth as best as he could, but the horrible taste still lingered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he couldn't afford to waste time. He quickly rinsed a few more times and returned to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sycophantic tone, he asked, "Mr. Fitzgerald, are you satisfied now? Can you remove the ban on our family's accounts?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at his now pristine shoes and nodded in satisfaction. "You really are quite a good little dog."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Marcus dialed Battle God Oliver's number again and ordered the unfreezing of Noel's family's accounts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire conversation was more of a command than a discussion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people around them could hear the tone of authority in Marcus' voice as he spoke to Oliver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made many of them tremble with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' status seemed far more influential than they had imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus hung up, Noel still felt a gnawing sense of anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He feared Marcus' words might not be honored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could even entertain that thought, his father's call came through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Noel, the accounts are unlocked! This is amazing! How did you do it? How did you manage to get the ban lifted so quickly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noel's father's excited voice echoed through the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Noel felt a rush of joy. "That's great! It's done, it's done!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kept repeating the words, avoiding any mention of how he had achieved it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His father's curiosity was piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued, "Noel, you still haven't answered me. How did you manage to get the Ortega family to lift the ban on us so fast?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noel's face turned pale as he recalled the repulsive taste. He quickly said, "Dad, let's not mention it anymore. Just forget it, alright? I have other things to do. I'll explain when I get back to Kingston."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for his father to speak again, Noel hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Marcus, who remained calm as ever, Noel's heart raced with unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Marcus had called to lift the ban on their family's accounts, Noel could now clearly understand the extent of Marcus' power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a man of divine status, someone who could influence the Ortega family's </span><span>decisions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man like that had crossed paths with him, and he had severely offended him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noel felt incredibly unlucky but also strangely fortunate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlucky because he encountered Marcus, but fortunate because his efforts had won Marcus' forgiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, thank you for lifting the ban on our family's accounts. I can't thank you enough!" Noel said, bowing once again in gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed as though he had forgotten the humiliation he had endured earlier, and in his heart, he unexpectedly felt a sense of gratitude toward Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't thank me. This is all your own doing. Just remember, stay humble from now on. Don't flaunt the Ortega family's name everywhere. There's always someone more powerful than you. You never know when you might offend someone you can't afford to cross."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved his hand dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noel nodded vigorously, too afraid to defy Marcus in any way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus then turned his gaze toward Natalie, who had been in a daze. "Are you full?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie nodded stiffly. "Yes, I'm full."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let's go. This market only has a decent barbecue," Marcus said, taking Natalie's hand and leading her out of the market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The barbecue stall owner had witnessed everything and was trembling with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who would have thought that the young man who had been coming to </span><span>his</span><span> </span><span>stall for years was actually such a top-tier figure?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you still standing there? Let's go!" Noel said coldly to Hadley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley, covered in bruises from the beating, nodded obediently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Noel's suffering had been caused by her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, if she left Noel, she wouldn't be able to find a man as outstanding as him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Noel had hit her, Hadley still decided to stay with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, everything that had happened today had completely shattered her understanding of things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even now, she was still trembling with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she ever encountered Marcus and Natalie again, she would never dare to offend them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, had no idea what was going through Hadley's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By this time, he had already gotten into the car and was driving back to Natalie's place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, I've caused you trouble again..." Natalie said apologetically, looking up at him with a guilty expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled and reassured her, "They're just a couple of small-time people. It's no trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With what happened today, Hadley shouldn't dare to cause you any more problems."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie nodded </span><span>vigorously,</span><span> her eyes full of admiration as she looked at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't believe that he had managed to handle Noel, a member of the Ortega </span><span>family, in such a dominant way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had not only made Hadley suffer but also forced Noel to bow and apologize in front of everyone, even making him lick his shoes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she hadn't seen it with her own eyes, Natalie would never have believed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, she had officially become the owner of eight top-tier custom jewelry stores, all thanks to Marcus. Her gratitude toward him grew even stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' left hand was firmly on the steering wheel as he drove, while his right hand unexpectedly moved to caress Natalie's beautiful leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie, dressed in a light-colored dress, had her long, slender legs exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gently touched her skin and could feel its smoothness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When his hand brushed against the inner part of her thigh, Natalie couldn't help but let out a soft hum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, what are you trying to do..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie instantly blushed, realizing what was about to happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just doing what normal couples do," Marcus smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While speaking, his large hand had already reached in and touched deep inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of Marcus' fingers began to roam continuously over her leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden surge of sensation caused Natalie to let out a high-pitched cry, her face turning even more crimson.</span></p></div>
