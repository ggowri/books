  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But did you ever think about how hard my life is? I'm a woman fighting in the entertainment industry, constantly facing pressure and humiliation. All the money I make goes to paying taxes and the entertainment company I signed with. After that, there are so many other necessary expenses. After all that, I really don't have much left!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I bought this apartment, and it's the smallest in the whole community. On top of that, I have to pay over ten thousand dollars a month for the mortgage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm stingy? But if you roughly calculate it, over the past five years, I've already given you over three million dollars. That's almost all my savings, and yet you still say this to me...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, you're using the money to buy drugs! I've told you time and time again that drug addiction is a bottomless pit, and the damage it does to your body is permanent. Yet, you refuse to listen and only get worse!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at what drugs have done to you! You're completely drained. Just last week, I gave you half a million dollars, and now you want another one hundred thousand dollars? This is too much..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe poured out all the grievances she had held in her heart for so many years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the man remained unfazed, coldly responding, "Talking to me about this is useless. All I need is money. If I don't get the one hundred thousand dollars when my withdrawal symptoms hit, I'll die. Don't you want to watch me die? After all, I'm your brother!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, the man's body trembled, and his face grew paler, his eyes flickering erratically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe knew this was indeed the early signs of her brother's drug withdrawal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she hated her brother deeply, the thought of him dying from withdrawal softened her heart. She didn't want to see him die, no matter what.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting her teeth, she said, "I'll call Lila later to see if she has any spare cash. But remember, this is the last time I'll help you. Don't come to me again next time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saying this, Chloe took out her phone and was about to dial Lila's number when Marcus suddenly snatched the phone from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you really believe a drug addict's words? If you give him one hundred thousand dollars today, in less than three days, he'll come back to ask for two hundred thousand dollars, using the same excuse about dying from withdrawal. It's a never-ending cycle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you're making more money now, you can't afford to keep doing this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' words were full of urgency, and Chloe seemed to snap out of it instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't know what to do and collapsed to the floor, crying uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sometimes wondered why her brother couldn't be like other people's brothers, caring and considerate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least be a normal person and not be addicted to drugs. It would have been so much better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But things didn't go as she wished. Ever since her brother got hooked on drugs a few years ago, it had been downhill from there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially this year, he was being tortured by drugs to the point where he was unrecognizable, and his demands for money kept growing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It could be said that the money he spent on drugs mostly came from Chloe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was also one of the main reasons why, despite being a rising star, Chloe seemed so poor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With such a bottomless pit demanding money from her, how could she possibly save any?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard, this is none of your business! Stay out of it, or I'll make you regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man stood up from the floor, glaring at Marcus with a murderous look in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To a drug addict, anyone who tries to stop them from using is worse than a threat to their life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm handling this today, and if you've got the guts, come at me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said, making a gesture with his hand as if inviting the man to come closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't stand how this man kept draining his sister like a vampire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone with a conscience would try to quit drugs and not burden their family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was ready to teach this guy a lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dammit, today I'm going all in with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Marcus' provocation, the man immediately flew into a rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed a stone from the ground and hurled it violently at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't even try to dodge. With a casual punch, he slammed his fist directly into the man's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A loud thud echoed through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man staggered back, blood pouring from his nose, wincing in pain and gritting his teeth.</span></p><div class="pagination">
