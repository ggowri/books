        <h1>Chapter 957 Regarded Him as Her Boyfriend</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe regained consciousness. Her face was still rosy, and her body glistened with sweat. She looked even more alluring than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hug me." She sat up and opened her arms, causing her ample breasts to tremble slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus went to the bed, pulling her into his arms and stroking her hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've cleared the cold energy from your body and treated your gynecological issues. How do you feel?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe's eyes sparkled with amazement. "It's incredible. I don't feel cold now, and the dull pain in my lower abdomen is gone. Even my skin looks different."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked up at him with admiration. "Marcus, did you study medicine before? You're so skilled."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I just have some knowledge," Marcus replied, shaking his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe pouted, "You're being so humble. Interesting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>'"Interesting? Is it this?" Marcus pointed jokingly at his flaccid member.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe's gaze instantly fell there, and her cheeks flushed red. "You're so annoying! Humph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've had made love. What are you ashamed of?" Marcus said, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't the first time he had encountered this reaction. Even though they had shared an intimate experience, afterward, the women would often feel embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, during their encounter, they had been even more passionate than he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, weren't you treating me? Why did we end up doing this?" Chloe seemed to recall something and asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh..." Marcus' forehead creased. "Didn't you want it? When we were together, you asked me to move faster and harder. Don't tell me you've forgotten already."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe shot him a fierce glance. "You're so wicked..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, she hadn't forgotten. The intense sensations they had just shared were unlike anything she had ever experienced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The feeling still lingered in her mind, and even now, she felt a strong urge to relive it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've done this, and now I'm yours. I feel guilty about Lila. After all, you're her boyfriend," Chloe said, suddenly looking depressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus thought of Lila and reassured Chloe, "This isn't your fault. Don't blame yourself. I'll explain everything to Lila." He took the responsibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe gazed at his profile and lost in admiration. A man with such capability and responsibility was hard not to admire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, she realized how much she needed him. She tightened her grip around his waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Chloe's phone rang. She glanced at the screen and saw her aunt's name, Eulalia Sinclair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She answered the call. "What's up, aunt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eulalia, a middle-aged woman, said, "Chloe, your cousin is back from abroad. Let's have a family dinner tomorrow. She wants to see you and introduce you to someone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Chloe frowned slightly, but she maintained her composure. "Aunt, I've been busy these days. Can we reschedule? I'll treat her another day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're so ungrateful now that you're famous. Your cousin hasn't seen you for two years. Don't you want to meet her? If you don't want to come, just say so. I won't force you," Eulalia said, her tone turning cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe quickly explained, "Aunt, I'm really busy, but I'll make time to come. By the way, who is the person my cousin wants me to meet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eulalia said, "An executive at SiliconWave Technologies in Kingston. He earns millions annually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chloe, even though you're a famous star now, the showbiz isn't simple. Stars rely on their youth and beauty. Once you're older, it'll be harder to make money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your cousin cared about you and decided to introduce her classmate to you during this visit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can build a good relationship with him and even marry him, your career will become smoother, and you'll live a wealthy life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Chloe took a deep breath, seemingly anticipating what was coming. She responded, "Aunt, I have a boyfriend, and I don't want to meet other men. Please tell my cousin not to introduce him to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eulalia was surprised. "What? You have a boyfriend? Why haven't you ever mentioned this to me? Are you lying to me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm your aunt, and I always care about you. I wanted to introduce you to a good match, but you're so stubborn!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, you must come to the dinner tomorrow. Bring your boyfriend along too. I want to see if he's good enough for you. If not, you should consider your cousin's classmate instead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Chloe could respond, Eulalia hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe rolled her eyes, looking helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eulalia had always been a strong-willed and domineering person. Many times, she would force Chloe to do things under the guise of being an elder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Chloe's rise to fame as a leading actress had been entirely self-made. Eulalia had never provided any support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The woman is your aunt?" Marcus asked curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Will you go to the dinner tomorrow?" Marcus continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have no choice. If I don't go, she might come to my house or even to my film set to take me there. So I have to go," Chloe replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why is your aunt so domineering?" Marcus asked, surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe sighed, "She's my father's sister. My father and his older sister passed away early, leaving only my aunt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She treats me and my brother like her own children, but in fact, she only orders us around without giving any real help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alas, never mind. She's my elder. I have no choice but to accommodate her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus could see Chloe's frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, relatives like Eulalia were very common. Everyone likely had a few such relatives who acted authoritative but rarely offered any assistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had encountered such people, just like his uncle, Nick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Will you come with me to the dinner tomorrow? My aunt wants to meet you," Chloe asked, looking at Marcus expectantly. Now, she regarded him as her boyfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No problem," Marcus nodded. Chloe was his woman, and he naturally wanted to fulfill his duties as her boyfriend.</span></p></div>
