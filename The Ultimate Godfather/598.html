  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darian came over and reminded Marcus, "Mr. Fitzgerald, Tim must have asked someone more powerful to deal with you. Please leave here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darian didn't expect things to develop to this point. These plainclothes policemen armed with pistols had already pressured him enough. If some people more powerful came, Darian was afraid that something terrible would happen to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiera said, "Mr. Fitzgerald, at worst, we can just close the logistics company, but we can't risk your life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave Darian and Kiera a reassuring look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Setting up a logistics company was an essential step in building Marcus' business world. Without a logistics company, he would have no liberty and couldn't make his business grow bigger and stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Marcus had to get rid of Tim today. Otherwise, Tim would always be an obstacle to expanding Marcus' business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, the sound of sirens was heard at the gate of Darian Logistics Company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several police cars drove over and stopped in the courtyard. Dustin, fully armed, got out of the lead vehicle, accompanied by dozens of policemen in combat uniforms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition, some people found that there were several snipers at the heights of Darian Logistics Company's building. Their guns were all aimed at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dustin is here with his men. Marcus, you are a dead man." Seeing Dustin and these armed policemen, Gary smiled in surprise. He was looking forward to seeing Marcus being shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone around couldn't help but gasp in shock. They didn't expect Tim to be so powerful. Tim could actually ask Dustin over to help him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone thought, "Marcus is doomed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim spoke to Marcus with an arrogant look, "My support has arrived. Let me go, or I will have Dustin shoot you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus suddenly slapped Tim. "You are so noisy. Shut up, or I'll break your neck right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim grimaced in pain, and several of his back teeth were knocked out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim wailed as he spoke to Dustin, "Dustin, shoot him. He wants to kill me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dustin frowned. He didn't expect that the gangster would be so bold. He brought so many fully armed policemen over, but the gangster still dared to beat Tim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dustin was about to order the sniper to shoot when he saw Marcus. He said in surprise, "Mr. Fitzgerald? Why are you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dustin never thought he would meet Marcus again. The last time they met was when Marcus had a conflict with Director Rollins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Director Rollins had called Dustin over for help. Dustin was unaware of the situation. When he led his men to the scene and tried to capture the criminals, he found that the person Director Rollins wanted to deal with was Marcus. Then, Dustin immediately ordered a retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dustin had witnessed the scene in Solomia Pharmaceutical Industrial Park some time ago. Even the mayor, Benjamin Mitchell, and Brenden Wilde, the dean of Solomia Special Police Academy, were very respectful to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dustin was just a team leader, and he dared not provoke Marcus at all. Later, Dustin realized how wise his decision to retreat was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that day, Dustin learned that Director Rollins had been dismissed from his post and investigated for corruption and bribery and had finally been sentenced to 15 years in prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dustin was smart, and he naturally knew that all this was related to Marcus. If he had listened to Director Rollins' order, he would have had the same end as him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dustin had always reminded himself that he could never provoke Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Dustin never expected that Tim had called him here to deal with Marcus. This made Dustin feel irritated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled, "Dustin, we meet again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dustin had a pale face. He wiped the sweat from his forehead, forced a smile, and said, "What a coincidence, Mr. Fitzgerald. We meet again so soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene stunned everyone present. They could see that Dustin seemed to be very familiar with Marcus. Besides, judging from Dustin's words and deeds, Dustin seemed to be very respectful to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone thought, "Could it be that Marcus' identity is not as simple as we imagine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim roared, "What are you doing, Dustin? Shoot this bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim noticed that something was wrong, but he didn't believe that Marcus could be compared with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dustin looked grim and said to Tim, "Mr. Fitzgerald is someone I need to be respectful to. I can't comply with your request. I have to go."</span></p><div class="pagination">
