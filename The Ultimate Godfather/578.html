        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After spending another night at Lila's place, Marcus hopped on a flight back to </span><span>Solomia</span><span> the next morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His stay in Kingston had dragged on far too long, and he had a promise to keep. Before leaving for Kingston, he had told Catherine he'd help her buy a house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it had been over ten days, and he'd already missed their agreed date.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as his plane landed, Marcus pulled out his phone and dialed Catherine's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine, enjoying a rare day off at home, practically lit up when she heard his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had offered to pick him up from the airport, but Marcus declined and took a cab straight to Catherine's neighborhood instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he arrived at the gate of her apartment complex, his eyes immediately picked her out of the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the entrance, a variety of street vendors had set up shop, adding to the lively atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wore a light pink dress, and even amidst the hustle and bustle, she stood out effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine's natural charm and gentle demeanor made her a magnet for attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with just a dab of makeup, she looked stunning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Catherine, did you miss me?" Marcus teased, sneaking up behind her and giving her shoulder a playful tap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine jumped with a small yelp, spinning around, her eyes wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus! That was quick!" she exclaimed, her voice bubbling with joy. "I'm so happy you're here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she saw Marcus, a radiant smile spread across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit her lip nervously and added, "I've been here for a while now. Maybe we don't need to rush into buying a house. I mean, I heard </span><span>Solomia's</span><span> real estate prices have shot up again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tone was soft, almost hesitant as if she didn't want to burden him with the expense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled, shaking his head. "Absolutely not. This place isn't safe, and it's definitely not up to your standards. You're the general manager of Sync Group's </span><span>Solomia</span><span> branch now. You deserve better than this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine's cheeks turned a soft shade of pink. "Marcus, if it weren't for you, I wouldn't even have this job. I owe it all to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gratitude was heartfelt. Marcus had not only saved her mother's life but also given her the career of a lifetime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're my woman," Marcus said with an easy grin. "It's my job to take care of you. No arguments&mdash;we're house shopping today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He added with a wink, "And about commuting? Forget the subway. You need a car, </span><span>and I'll take care of that too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine hesitated. "I've had my license for years, but honestly, I've barely driven. I'm scared I'll mess it up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus laughed. "Driving's not rocket science. You'll pick it up. Let's start with a small car to get you comfortable. Once you're a pro, we'll upgrade."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine nodded slowly, trusting him, though a little unsure of herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hailed a cab and headed to a Mini dealership, where Marcus bought her a brand-new Mini JCW for 350,000 dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car was less than 12 feet long&mdash;small, sleek, and oh-so-cute, yet it packed a punch that could rival some serious performance machines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the ultimate wolf in sheep's clothing, a playful charmer with a wild side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what truly sealed the deal was its design&mdash;inside and out, every detail was crafted to perfection, blending elegance with fun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Honestly, who could say no to a car this irresistibly adorable? It was practically made to steal hearts at first glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine fell in love with it almost immediately. In less than an hour, the paperwork was signed, and Catherine was behind the wheel of her very first car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They drove straight to Dragon Crest One, a luxury residential complex near Sync Group's </span><span>Solomia</span><span> office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The community was a cut above the rest, boasting stunning river-view apartments and top-tier amenities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to its prime location and excellent connectivity, the community offered top-notch amenities and services. With an average price exceeding 80,000 dollars per square meter and a minimum unit size of over 200 square meters, it was the very definition of a luxury residence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus knew that Dragon Crest One was a government-backed development under </span><span>Solomia's</span><span> Finance Bureau. The future residents would mostly be high-ranking officials, making it an exclusive and elite community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In terms of safety, it was undoubtedly in a league of its own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus parked in the underground garage, where security guards directed them to a reserved spot with precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sales office, sleek and modern, welcomed them with open arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A professional sales associate quickly stepped up to assist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After an in-depth walkthrough of the available options, Marcus' eyes settled on the jewel of the complex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A 380-square-meter penthouse, perched at the heart of the community, offered sweeping views of the city skyline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The price tag was a cool </span><span>thirty</span><span> million dollars. And it was worth every cent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Marcus was about to seal the deal, a man and a young woman approached from across the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man, short and wiry, looked to be in his early fifties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young woman, however, bore an uncanny resemblance to Catherine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Catherine? Is that really you?" the woman called </span><span>out,</span><span> her voice filled with surprise. "What are you doing here? Did you start working here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine turned toward the voice, her brows lifting in recognition as her gaze landed on the approaching pair.</span></p></div>
