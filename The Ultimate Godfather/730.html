        <h1>Chapter 729 Fists and Fury!</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie didn't dare to speak anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley's words had some truth to them, after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But deep down, she knew that ever since they'd reunited, Marcus had never been one to boast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The feats he achieved were deemed impossible by others, yet he accomplished them with an almost effortless grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could this time be the same?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie desperately hoped for a miracle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, country bumpkin, are you just spouting nonsense?" Hadley sneered at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't bother to entertain her. "In less than five minutes, he'll get a call from Battle God Oliver. Then you'll see if I'm lying or not."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he said this, both Noel and Hadley nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged glances. It made sense. If Marcus' words were true, the Ortega family would act swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, I'll wait five minutes. Let's see how your lies unravel," Noel said, his voice dripping with sarcasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as the words left his mouth, his phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noel froze for a split second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, he refused to believe it could be Oliver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He instinctively reached for his phone, noticing an incoming call from an unfamiliar number. There was nothing remarkable about the number itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't one of those repetitive sequences often associated with the wealthy or influential. Instead, it was a jumbled, almost chaotic string of digits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This only reinforced his skepticism. He answered the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Noel could even speak, a deep voice resonated from the other end of the line, "Is this Noel Ortega?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. Are you from an insurance company, a bank, or some education agency? I'm busy right now, so cut the crap!" Noel responded with a hint of irritation in his voice. Due to the breach of his personal information, he was used to getting spam calls from these places, and they always annoyed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he still believed that the call must be coming from one of those agencies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the voice on the other end was low and commanding. "This is Battle God Oliver."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noel's heart skipped a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, his lips curled into a mocking smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without responding, he hung up and turned to Marcus. "You've got some nerve, </span><span>bumpkin. Hiring an actor to impersonate Battle God Oliver? You think I'm stupid? I'll report this to the Ortega family and let them deal with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Noel, the call was clearly a setup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way Battle God Oliver would ever contact him on Marcus' behalf. It was absurd!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley chuckled with mockery. "Oh, this is funny. Hiring an actor? That's a new one. Noel, if you weren't so sharp, we might've fallen for it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noel nodded, smirking. "Scammers these days are getting creative. One slip, and you're caught in their trap."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at Marcus. "You think you can mess with me? Today, you're going to pay for this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was about to call some underground contacts to eliminate Marcus permanently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then would his anger be satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could dial, his phone rang again. This time, it was his father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noel answered casually, "Dad, I'm in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>. I'll be back in a few days. What's up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His father's voice was frantic. "I just got word that the Ortega family has frozen all our assets, including your mother's and my accounts. We've lost it all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noel trembled as if struck by lightning. His mind went blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He blurted out, "What are you talking about? Everything was fine yesterday! Why would the Ortega family do this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You idiot! The Ortega family said you offended someone you shouldn't have. That person complained to Battle God Oliver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The patriarch of the Ortega family was furious. This is all your fault!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His father's voice was seething with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he were there in person, he'd probably break Noel's legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noel's heart sank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He and Hadley had just arrived in </span><span>Solomia</span><span> and had been wandering the night market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wondered when he had offended anyone important enough to involve Battle God Oliver and the patriarch of the Ortega family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying possibility dawned on him. He stammered, "Dad, did the Ortega family mention the name of this person? If I offended him, I'll apologize right now. Maybe we can get our assets unfrozen if he can forgive me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His father replied, "His name is Marcus Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he heard the name, Noel froze, his mind exploding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body trembled violently, and he nearly collapsed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley grabbed his arm. With true concern, she asked, "Noel, what's wrong? Are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus? How could it be Marcus? Why him..." Noel muttered incoherently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley, standing close, caught his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She asked curiously, "Noel, why are you talking about Marcus? Did the Ortega family decide to punish him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could finish, Noel shot out his hand, slapping her across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force sent her sprawling to the ground, her cheek swelling instantly. She let out a sharp cry, clutching her face in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Noel, why did you hit me? I'm your girlfriend!" she shouted, tears streaming down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been with Noel for nearly a year, and this was the first time he had ever raised a hand against her. The sting of betrayal bled through her heart. At the same time, she couldn't help but think that perhaps Noel was under some sort of delusion or had mistaken her for someone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up, you bitch! This is all your fault! Because of you, I offended someone I shouldn't have, and now my family has lost everything! You're the reason I'm in this mess!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I must kill you! You bitch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Enraged, Noel lunged at her, fists and feet flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley, a woman with no strength to resist, was soon battered and bruised, her cries echoing through the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The commotion drew the attention of onlookers. Their eyes were filled with pity. But no one dared to step in.</span></p></div>
