        <h1>Chapter 762 Surrender of the Nuer Tribe-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, compared to the Nuer Tribe, their power was still relatively weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Currently, the Nuer Tribe's strength was comparable to the three great sects of the world of Ancient Martial Art in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to the Cursed Power that had previously restricted the tribe's people, their potential had been suppressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the curse was lifted, it would be the moment when the Nuer Tribe's true potential exploded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, the tribe would undoubtedly transform into a terrifying force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Fitzgerald, for accepting us. From now on, we are willing to serve you loyally and risk everything for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Marcus' agreement, Raphael and others were visibly emotional and again bowed deeply to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, the space-time gate will open on time in three days. It is the only passage to the world beyond the </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although we have guarded this underwater world and the space-time gate for generations, no one has ever entered the gate. It is filled with dangers and unknowns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The legendary Return Essence Crystal is indeed located within the space-time gate. Mr. Fitzgerald, if you intend to enter, I will immediately help you open the gate's seal when it opens in three days," Raphael said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes narrowed as he gave a slight nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He subconsciously raised his gaze toward the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There had been no communication from Ada, which meant she hadn't encountered any trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus decided to temporarily stay in the Nuer Tribe, and after three days, he would return to the surface and bring Ada there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are still three days left. I should be able to remove the curse on your key members. As for the rest, I plan to lift the curses on all of you after the space-time gate opens," Marcus said as his gaze swept over the people of the Nuer Tribe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing his words, the people became visibly excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raphael asked, "Mr. Fitzgerald, are you truly planning to lift the curse from us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled and replied, "You've already pledged </span><span>your </span><span>allegiance to me, so you are now my people. It's only natural for me to help you lift the curse. What's so strange about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's wonderful! I'll prepare a room for you right away!" Raphael said, his face filled with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that Marcus needed a quiet place to lift the curse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately ordered the best and quietest room in the Nuer Tribe's area to be cleared out and cleaned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to the urgency of the situation, Marcus didn't rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He went straight to the room and began the process of lifting the curse from Raphael.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was overjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although his condition was not as severe as his daughter, Nadia's, Raphael had been </span><span>enduring great pain every day, and the curse had hindered his cultivation progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the curse could be lifted, it would be like a rebirth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the curse wasn't as severe in his case, it only took half an hour for Marcus to completely remove the curse from Raphael.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he seemed to undergo a complete transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes, once dull, became sharp and full of life, and even his previously white hair became dark and thick again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His complexion had completely changed for the better as if he had been rejuvenated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, after the curse was lifted, Raphael's latent potential was unleashed, and his cultivation level skyrocketed directly to Stage Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it wasn't as dramatic as Nadia breaking through four levels, it was still an impressive achievement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furthermore, without the curse, Raphael's future cultivation would no longer be restricted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could now enter the space-time gate to seek the Return Essence Crystal, preparing for his advancement into the Return Essence stage.</span></p></div>
