        <h1>Chapter 985 The Missing Girl Case-1</h1>
        <div><p>After the crowd gradually dispersed, Morgana couldn&#x27;t help but ask, &quot;Marcus, who exactly are you?&quot;</p><p>Earlier, when the captain of the city&#x27;s criminal police showed Marcus such deep respect, she had already been stunned.</p><p>She could hardly imagine how a young man from the countryside could earn such respect from the captain of the city&#x27;s criminal police.</p><p>What surprised her even more was that even members of Solomia&#x27;s top underground gang, Serpent&#x27;s Coil, were at his disposal.</p><p>He seemed capable of anything.</p><p>Someone like him couldn&#x27;t possibly be an ordinary young man from the countryside.</p><p>It was hard for Morgana to believe that Marcus had no prominent background.</p><p>Marcus waved casually and said with a smile, &quot;Didn&#x27;t you already know? I&#x27;m just a farmer&#x27;s son, that&#x27;s all.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Fine, don&#x27;t tell me then.&quot; Morgana glared at Marcus.</p><p>Seeing that he clearly didn&#x27;t want to reveal more, she didn&#x27;t press further.</p><p>Aidan was thrown into the sea by Jalen and the others, almost impossible to survive, while Faith was beaten black and blue and wouldn&#x27;t dare disturb Morgana again in the future.</p><p>Thinking of this, Morgana instantly felt much more relieved.</p><p>However, Marcus still had many things to handle, so he bid farewell to Morgana and left.</p><p>On the way back, Marcus turned on the car radio while driving.</p><p>His family was very poor when he was young and couldn&#x27;t afford a TV. He often stayed by the radio listening to the news.</p><p>At this moment, as he turned on the radio again, it inevitably brought back his memories.</p><p>&quot;This is a report from our station. Solomia police have recently received multiple reports of missing persons, most of whom are young women aged between 16 and 25. Particularly in the past three days, the number of missing persons has risen sharply.&quot;</p><p>&quot;As of noon, Solomia police have received over a hundred reports and are taking the matter seriously, deploying a large police force to conduct a citywide investigation.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Currently, no clues about the perpetrator have been found, and the missing girls remain unlocated. According to this station&#x27;s reporter, who spoke with police officials, the case has been classified as a terrorist crime, and a special task force has been formed for an in-depth investigation.&quot;</p><p>&quot;In addition, several cities around Solomia have recently reported similar cases, with the methods, motives, and timing highly consistent with those in Solomia.&quot;</p><p>&quot;For updates on the case&#x27;s progress, please stay tuned to this station&#x27;s reports.&quot;</p><p>This news successfully caught Marcus&#x27;s attention.</p><p>In just three days, over a hundred people went missing in Solomia, all young women.</p><p>Such a large-scale case is extremely rare across Uswad.</p><p>Marcus had a hunch that whoever was behind this might not be an ordinary terrorist group but likely an organization with a cultivation background.</p><p>Otherwise, with such thorough police investigations, there should at least be some clues.</p><p>Whoever was behind it, kidnapping was a crime against humanity. While Marcus was no savior, he despised such people.</p><p>More importantly, many girls he knew fell within the target range.</p><p>Thinking of this, Marcus immediately called Edgar, the leader of the Seven Stars Association.</p><p>He explained the situation in detail to Edgar, provided information and addresses of all the girls he knew, and requested Edgar to send people to protect them secretly.</p><p>Edgar immediately accepted the order and promised to deploy Serpent&#x27;s Coil&#x27;s elite forces to fully protect these girls.</p><p>With the cultivation resources provided by Marcus, Serpent&#x27;s Coil has now trained several Masters.</p><p>Among them, Jalen&#x27;s cultivation has reached Level Seven Wizard, and all members of the Magic Squad have advanced to Level Six Wizard.</p><p>Combined with the Energy Crystal guns previously improved by Diana, Serpent&#x27;s Coil has become a formidable force, even capable of easily crushing the three major Ancient Martial Art sects of Uswad in the past.</p><p>Therefore, Marcus felt very assured of Serpent&#x27;s Coil&#x27;s ability to protect these girls.</p><p>At the same time, Marcus realized even more deeply the importance of building up his own power.</p></div>
