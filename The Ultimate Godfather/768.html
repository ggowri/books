        <h1>Chapter 765 One Step Away</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I can't bear it anymore. Please, harder. I feel so comfortable... so good..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan's delicate hands clenched the bed sheets, her expression showing a very ecstatic look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stimulation from below made her unable to resist, and she felt as if she was flying in the clouds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Marcus, too, felt an extremely strong sense of pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel that Susan was different from any other woman he had ever met.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was because the woman had the blood of sea creatures flowing in her body, which made her </span><span>more unrestrained and wild</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan, having her first encounter of that kind with Marcus, was less restrained than a </span><span>typical human woman, displaying more passion and initiative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It gave him a unique feeling, further stimulating the deeper sensitive nerves within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He began to thrust more wildly, with quite a large amplitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Susan felt endless comfort, and her lower body kept contracting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time Marcus thrust, he could touch her deeper part.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The differences between Susan and human women were not only reflected in their personalities but also seemed to extend to their physical structure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least the contraction force of her lower body was much greater than that of a human female.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every contraction made Marcus feel like he was about to ejaculate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If his cultivation had not already reached Ancient Martial Stage Nine, he would have most likely not been able to hold on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, why are you so strong? You've completely filled me up. Princess Nadia didn't lie to me. I can feel the cloud-like feeling when I'm being treated by you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan completely spread apart her beautiful legs, and the mysterious gap was presented to his sight, making it more convenient for him to thrust harder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, her words made Marcus raise an eyebrow slightly. He hadn't expected that the two girls would secretly discuss such intimate matters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It further confirmed the fact that the women of the Nuer Tribe were </span><span>more bold and unrestrained</span><span> than human women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they were practicing Dual Cultivation, Marcus did not waste any time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly activated the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, using the connection between their bodies to channel Numinous Energy into her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It caused Susan to experience endless pleasure, and with the added power of Dual Cultivation, she felt as if she were soaring in the clouds, as though every cell in her body was immersed in joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, as they constantly changed their postures, each could send her to an unprecedented peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the dual blessing of Dual Cultivation and Timeless Numinous Energy, Susan quickly reached several orgasms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body went limp and weak, and the Cursed Power within her was completely removed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her damaged organs were also fully restored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the curse was removed, Susan's potential was unleashed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Combined with the benefits gained from Dual Cultivation, she broke through to Stage Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That level was already comparable to Nadia's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In terms of talent, Susan was not as good as Nadia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But through the Dual Cultivation with Marcus, Susan overcame her talent disadvantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cultivation had actually caught up with Nadia's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the changes in her body, Marcus was satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, his sexual desire reached its peak, and a new round of violent thrusting began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, at a certain moment, Marcus reached his peak and completely released his essence, injecting it into Susan and filling her up completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under his violent thrusting, Susan reached her final orgasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both of them collapsed on the bed powerlessly, feeling completely liberated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because Susan was a virgin, after dual cultivating with her, Marcus' cultivation also advanced to the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Nine, just one step away from breaking through the Foundation Establishment Stage and stepping into the Return Essence stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Marcus, it was definitely a pleasant surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the space-time gate opened, as long as he could obtain a Return Essence Crystal, he would be able to step into the first realm of the Return Essence Stage, the Acquired State.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the thought of that, he couldn't help but feel a sense of anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he had exhausted a lot of energy, he didn't rest. Instead, he began to cultivate the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire to stabilize his cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Susan also woke up from her semi-unconscious state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the changes in her body, a look of surprise and joy immediately appeared on her stunning face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, the Cursed Power on me has been cleared. Thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she said that, she kissed Marcus on the cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at her angelic face, Marcus couldn't help but feel a surge of heat in his heart again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he could only forcefully suppress the impulse within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aside from Susan, many others were waiting for him to clear the Cursed Power from their bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He naturally couldn't indulge in desire and waste time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With the curse removed, your potential has been unlocked, and your cultivation has broken through," he said to Susan with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan nodded vigorously, looking at him with eyes full of admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, she went to the bathroom to take a shower, and after freshening up, she left the room to give others their turn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Susan, have you also reached Stage Seven?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she walked out of the room, Raphael and Elliott immediately approached her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon sensing the change in her aura, both of them were stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To them, Marcus was almost like a god. Not only could he remove the Cursed Power from their bodies, but he could also completely unlock their potential, thus enhancing their cultivation level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan gently nodded at Raphael and her father, saying, "Yes, it's all thanks to Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When mentioning Marcus, her mind involuntarily recalled the scenes from when she was with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart couldn't help but stir with a sense of desire again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia looked at Susan's flushed face and couldn't help but show a knowing smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As someone with experience, she naturally guessed what Susan had been through earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She directly pulled Susan aside and asked, "Susan, how is it? I didn't lie to you, did I? Doesn't it feel incredibly comfortable, like being on a cloud?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan's face was flushed, and she gently nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to hold back, she said, "Besides the cloud-like feeling you mentioned, Your Highness, I also experienced a deeper level of it. Would you like to try it for yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A look of curiosity appeared on Nadia's face, and she quickly asked, "What is this deeper feeling?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan leaned in close to Nadia's ear and whispered something to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia immediately became flushed, and her heart raced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Susan, are you telling the truth? You're not lying to me, are you?" Nadia asked, taking a deep breath, her heart secretly filled with some anticipation for that deeper feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course not," Susan said. "I'm your best friend and would never lie to you. If you get the chance, you'll see for yourself."</span></p></div>
