        <h1>Chapter 724 You Are Envious</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hadley, what do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley's words annoyed Natalie even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It sounded as though she might make a move on Noel when they had dinner with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't you comprehend what I'm saying? Isn't your intention precisely to seduce Noel? How could I possibly fail to see through your scheme?" Hadley sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why should I seduce him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie was unable to fathom Hadley's line of thinking. From the moment they had met up until now, she hadn't exchanged a single word with Noel. So, why on earth was Hadley being so wary?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haven't you always desired to find a wealthy boyfriend? Noel is a member of the Ortega family in Kingston, but your boyfriend is good-for-nothing. I firmly believe that you are envious!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two years ago, I snatched away your opportunity to work in Kingston. Now, you're trying to steal my boyfriend as a form of revenge against me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That incident that took place two years ago was of great significance. It's simply </span><span>impossible for you not to harbor any hatred towards me. And now, you're inviting me to sit down and have dinner together. How can this be believable?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Natalie, we've been colleagues for so many years. I know exactly what kind of person you are, so cut the act and be straight with me!" Hadley growled, as if she had seen through everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her perception, Natalie was ambitious for power, avaricious for money, and full of vanity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could she change her nature in just two years?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're mistaken. I invited the two of you to dinner because we were once best friends. </span><span>Since</span><span> we hadn't seen each other for two years, I was just being polite. You're really projecting your own thoughts onto others!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley's words nearly made Natalie laugh out of sheer exasperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was really ridiculous that Hadley actually thought that she had a crush on Noel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite hailing from the Ortega family, he could never take Marcus' place in Natalie's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were so many reasons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie and Marcus had been classmates since childhood. He took her virginity and saved her mother. Moreover, in order to save her face, he was willing to transfer her 20 billion dollars. When it came to supporting her in starting a business, he directly acquired eight stores of the brand along with the exclusive agency rights in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of this had truly touched her deeply. Frankly, in her view, no matter how excellent other men might be, none could hold a candle to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was more, she didn't know Noel at all. His noble status had nothing to do with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Natalie, you are still trying to deny it, aren't you? I really don't feel like tearing off your fake facade. After all, we used to be so close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Any woman will be drawn to a man as outstanding as Noel. If you had the courage to admit it, I could still consider you my best friend, but now you disappoint me so much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley let out a sneer, glanced at Noel, and continued, "Noel, what do you think we should do with her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noel sized Natalie up and replied, "Last year, I shelled out close to 500 million dollars in your store. I'm the highest-level VIP member there. If I lodge a complaint with the headquarters about her, even if the headquarters doesn't sack her, </span><span>surely</span><span> she'll be demoted to an ordinary sales assistant, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Complaint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a familiar attack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Hadley and Noel could get together. Their ideas were surprisingly consistent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley immediately beamed with joy. "Noel, you are so clever. However, I don't think this is a great plan. After all, her family is rather impoverished. If she loses her position as store manager, how on earth is she going to make a living in the days to come?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noel sneered, "She's been </span><span>cruel</span><span> to you, attempting to snatch your boyfriend, yet </span><span>you're still being nice to her. Hadley, you're far too kind-hearted!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words seemed to have found a reason for Hadley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She immediately nodded and smiled, "Noel, you are right. I have always been too kind. Otherwise, she would have been fired by the brand two years ago!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, she fixed her eyes on Natalie again and snorted, "Natalie, did you hear that? My boyfriend is the highest-level VIP member of the brand. The brand places the utmost importance on the customer experience. If he files a complaint against you, just imagine what kind of trouble you'll be in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie furrowed her brows. She harbored no ill will towards Hadley. In fact, she was prepared to bury the hatchet regarding the incident from two years ago and had even invited Hadley to sit down and share a meal together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Hadley tried to plot against her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've gone quiet, haven't you? Your silence tells me you're frightened, but it won't change a thing. You intend to seduce my boyfriend, yet that's never going to happen. Don't blame me for being ruthless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Hadley's opinion, Natalie's silence was a sign of fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> she added, "Noel, it's your time. Given your VIP membership status, I'm certain the brand will definitely give you some face."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noel lifted his chin haughtily and declared, "Of course. We're getting married this year. I intend to splurge one billion dollars on several sets of limited-edition jewelry from your store."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley was over the moon. She understood that he planned to lavish that money on her, and this realization instantly made her feel as if she were the happiest woman on earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noel reached for his phone and dialed the brand's customer service number.</span><span> </span></p></div>
