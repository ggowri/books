  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The neighborhood was old and rundown, with most of the streetlights broken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As evening deepened, the entire area was cloaked in near-complete darkness, save for the dim glow from residents' windows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Want me to walk you upstairs?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked, his tone casual, though his eyes lingered on Catherine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine blinked her big, doe-like eyes and murmured, "Maybe in a bit. I just... want to sit here with you a little longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She leaned lightly against Marcus' shoulder, her soft, sweet scent filling the space between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fragrance hit Marcus like a cool breeze on a hot day, soothing and utterly captivating. Unable to resist, he slipped an arm around her waist and pulled her closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine let out a tiny, surprised squeak, her body trembling just enough for Marcus to notice. Her cheeks turned a deep crimson almost instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could say anything, Marcus tilted his head and caught her lips in a gentle kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you been thinking about me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured, his voice low and teasing as his eyes met hers, those innocent features of hers tugging at something deep inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course I have," Catherine whispered, her voice soft but with a hint of frustration. "It's just... it's been so long since I've seen you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then, should we head upstairs?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked, his words laced with suggestion. He couldn't help the flood of memories&mdash;vivid images of their last encounter at her place playing in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine's blush deepened, and she gave him a quick, embarrassed glare. "No way! My parents caught us last time. I've never been so humiliated in my life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just the thought of that awkward scene made Catherine want to curl into herself. No way was she risking a repeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus grinned, a mischievous glint in his eyes. "Alright then... Maybe we'll test how good this car's suspension is instead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Catherine could respond, Marcus leaned forward, his weight pressing her gently back against the car seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warmth of his body, the scent of his cologne, and his undeniable presence overwhelmed her senses. Her breath quickened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus... we're still in the neighborhood. What if someone sees us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice </span><span>wavered,</span><span> the anxiety clear in her tone as her eyes darted toward the darkened streets outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus wasn't worried. With a flicker of concentration, he cast a shroud over the car using his spiritual senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the outside, the car appeared still, silent, and entirely unremarkable&mdash;no sound, no movement visible to anyone passing by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emboldened by his preparation, he slid her skirt higher, his hands finding their way to her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His palms pressed against her, and his fingers began exploring, teasing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine's voice broke into a soft, startled gasp as the sensations coursed through her, her body responding almost instinctively. A heat was building between her thighs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus reached for the clasp of her bra, quickly unhooking it and letting the fabric slip away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two voluptuous peaks emerged, their areolas tender and pink. Marcus took them in his mouth, instantly hitting Catherine's sensitive spots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body trembled, her secret folds secreting more fluid, engulfed by a profound emptiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus... stop teasing me... I can't take it anymore..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine's voice was soft and pleading, her tone only spurring Marcus' dominance further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly stripped off her skirt, revealing her beige underwear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Catherine opted for plain styles, her striking figure made even the simplest panties look incredibly seductive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially the outlined secret crevice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' hand ventured inside, finding a slippery wetness, subtly pulsating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to resist any longer, he removed the light-colored panties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The secret forest he hadn't visited in a long time was exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spread Catherine's pale, shapely legs and placed them on his shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He undressed quickly, his significant size ready, and slowly entered her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been so long since their last encounter that the initial stretch nearly overwhelmed Catherine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then a wave of intense pleasure swept through her, plunging her into endless bliss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice climbed in pitch with increasing intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus set a rhythmic pace with his thrusts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each movement reached deep, shaking Catherine to her core, and pushing her into a state of oblivion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially when Marcus' dual cultivation power was unleashed, she felt as though she was soaring through the clouds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah... Marcus, this feels so good... Can you love me like this often? Otherwise, I'll feel so alone..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine's eyes were sultry, her gaze tinged with a trace of melancholy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That look drove Marcus' desire to conquer even further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He intensified his thrusts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he sat down, lifting Catherine's body, continuing to enter her while lavishing kisses on her breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine cried out in fervent moans, her entire being vibrating in ecstasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intense stimulation made her feel as though she were flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't long before she reached another climax.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus reclined the seat and entered her once more, this time with even more vigor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like a tempest, Catherine felt an overwhelming intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a series of fierce impacts, Marcus finally released everything inside.</span></p><div class="pagination">
