  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus reminded Chloe. Chloe froze, her beautiful eyes betraying her shock. Killing someone&mdash;it sounded so effortless coming from Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could respond, Marcus stepped out of the car. He activated a rune from the Heavenly Circle Diagram to shield the car, ensuring Chloe's safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing still, Marcus lifted his gaze to the sky, his voice cold and commanding. </span><span>"Since you're here, stop hiding and show yourselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No sooner had the words left his mouth than several figures descended from the void. They were clad in black, long swords strapped to their backs, their bodies radiating a powerful sword aura. Simply standing there, they resembled living, breathing blades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two of them stood out, their cultivation at the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Six. In the entire </span><span>Uswad</span><span> world of ancient martial arts, such a level was enough to be considered top-tier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them, an older man with stark white hair despite being only in his forties, smirked coldly. "Didn't expect you'd park and walk straight into death. Gotta </span><span>admit</span><span>, I admire your guts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus ignored his provocation. "You're with Swords Sect?" he asked calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The white-haired man sneered, "Not bad. You're sharp enough to figure that out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus pressed on. "One more question&mdash;who sent you after me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another mocking laugh came from the man, his expression full of disdain. "You're a dead man anyway, so I might as well tell you. We're here on Mr. Zachary Walsh from Royal Entertainment's orders to kill you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes turned icy. He thought, "So, my hunch is right. After being humiliated&mdash;forced to kneel and slap himself in public&mdash;Zachary won't let this go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pulling himself from his thoughts, Marcus swept his gaze over the Swords Sect members. His voice was steady but carried an unmistakable edge. "I recently received an invitation from Mr. Sky, to meet tomorrow at the summit of Divine Mount. We're supposed to explore the </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall space-time gate together. So, I don't want to waste energy on you. Leave now, and I'll let this slide. My business with Zachary doesn't concern you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was firm but offered them a way out. After all, he had no grudge against Swords Sect and had even been invited by Liam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, the Swords Sect experts exchanged surprised glances. They thought, "How did this young man know about the </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall? That's supposed to be top secret, known only to high-ranking members of the sect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The white-haired man narrowed his eyes. "Cut the act, kid. Who do you think you are? Mr. Sky would never invite someone like you. Spill it&mdash;where did you hear that? Trying to scare us off with lies? Not </span><span>gonna</span><span> happen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smirked. "Don't believe me? If Mr. Sky hadn't personally invited me, I wouldn't even bother talking to you. This is your last chance&mdash;leave now, or face the consequences."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Swords Sect experts exchanged skeptical </span><span>looks,</span><span> their disdain evident. One of them, also the expert Ancient Martial Stage Six, said dismissively, "No need to waste words. He probably overheard something and is trying to bluff his way out. Kill him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Other experts nodded in agreement. Another Ancient Martial Stage Five expert stepped forward, his sword drawn and pointed at Marcus. "Kid, I'll admit you've got guts, but you've messed with the wrong people. Don't blame me for what happens next."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he prepared to unleash a strike, a purple lightning bolt suddenly split the air, crashing down with terrifying force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deafening crack echoed as the lightning obliterated the man, leaving nothing but shredded remains scattered across the ground. The metallic scent of blood filled the air, chilling everyone to the bone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other experts instinctively gasped, their faces pale as they stared at Marcus with newfound wariness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The white-haired man's expression twisted as he spoke through gritted teeth. "You're...a Level Six Wizard? No wonder you dared to challenge us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others nodded, finally understanding how Marcus had so effortlessly killed one of their own. A Level Six Wizard could indeed annihilate an Ancient Martial Stage Five expert in a single blow. They thought, "But still...he is alone. He can't take on all of us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled coldly, his hands clasped behind his back, "You really think I'm just a Level Six Wizard?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The white-haired man's eyes flashed with alarm, but he quickly sneered, "Stop bluffing. Let's see you handle this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he unleashed a terrifying surge of sword energy. The very air seemed to tremble as countless strands of sword aura converged, forming an immense blade in his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasted no time, swinging it toward Marcus with devastating force. The strike was powerful enough to rival someone at Ancient Martial Stage Seven, causing even his own comrades to take sharp breaths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "Surely, not even a Level Six Wizard could survive this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Marcus didn't flinch. Before the blade could reach him, he casually raised a fist and punched. It was a simple move&mdash;no grand display of power, no dramatic buildup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as his fist connected, the sword aura shattered like glass. The residual force from his punch tore through the air, heading straight for the white-haired man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's smirk froze, replaced by sheer terror. "Impossible. How can your Fist Ray be this powerful?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those were his last words. The Fist Ray consumed him entirely, reducing his body to nothing but vapor. A peak-stage expert </span><span>obliterated,</span><span> his remains scattered to the winds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining Swords Sect members were paralyzed with fear, their faces pale as they stared at Marcus in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus turned his gaze to them, his voice calm yet filled with menace. "Who's next?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The question sent a collective shiver through them. One of them finally mustered the courage to ask, his voice trembling. "Who...who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before Marcus could answer, a torrent of flames erupted from the void, engulfing the man who had spoken. He screamed, struggling to escape, but the fire burned with an intensity that reduced him to ash within seconds.</span></p><div class="pagination">
