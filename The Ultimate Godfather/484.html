        <h1>Chapter 483 The World Beyond</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Marcus felt his body enveloped by a surge of spatial energy. The scene before him blurred, and when his vision cleared, he was already standing in the courtyard of a villa. It was precisely where he had pictured in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Holy crap!" Marcus muttered, unable to hold back a curse. The teleportation was ridiculously powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the exhilaration was short-lived. A wave of weakness hit Marcus immediately after the teleport, draining his Numinous Energy. And that was just for a short distance. The farther the teleportation, the more energy it consumed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While it seemed feasible for Marcus to teleport anywhere in the world, he realized he couldn't ignore the toll it took on his Numinous Energy. After all, if he teleported to an area and faced a formidable opponent, the massive Numinous Energy drain could leave him at a severe disadvantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Marcus attempted another teleport, this time returning to his room. The second jump drained nearly 20% of his total Numinous Energy, leaving him to estimate that a short-distance teleport used up about 10% each time, while longer jumps could easily consume 30% or more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sobering discovery made it clear that while teleportation was an extraordinary skill, it wasn't something Marcus could use recklessly. Long-distance jumps, in particular, came with considerable risks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in his room, Marcus sat down to meditate. In less than 20 minutes, he had restored the 20% of Numinous Energy he had lost, returning to peak condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Marcus' thoughts turned to the map lodged in his mind. As his consciousness delved into it, he was amazed at its clarity. The map displayed every country on Earth, and when he zoomed in, it pinpointed every village, neighborhood, and even individual building with astonishing precision. It felt almost like using one of those popular navigation apps, only far more advanced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus sensed something peculiar about the map as he continued exploring it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under normal circumstances, Morvalis is a massive landmass spanning approximately 3.9 million square miles, slightly larger than the entire region of Uswad. But on this map, Morvalis appeared as a colossal ring encircling all the continents, including Talvania, Duscaro, Borealis, Aridia, and Auriona. It resembled a towering ice wall, sealing off the known world entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus suddenly recalled an article he had read, one that delved into a mysterious theory known as the Mega-Sphere Hypothesis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike the flat Earth theory, the Mega-Sphere Hypothesis maintained that the Earth was still round, but its overall size was far greater than anyone could imagine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In maps based on this theory, Morvalis wasn't a single landmass but a massive ring encircling the familiar continents. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The edge of this ring was marked by an enormous ice wall, thousands of feet high, with its airspace locked by some unknown force. Even the most advanced aircraft in the world couldn't penetrate the icy perimeter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beyond this ice wall lay an even vaster world filled with gigantic continents, islands, and endless seas. These unexplored regions were said to host an array of unique creatures and ecosystems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the theory were true, humanity's known living space would account for only a fraction of the Earth's total area. It could even be less than one-thousandth of it. It claimed the world's true expanse lay beyond the Morvalis ice wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, because this outer world was sealed off by mysterious forces, Earth still appeared to be the familiar globe seen from space. It was still the fifth planet in the solar system.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This controversial theory caused a global sensation but was repeatedly dismissed by mainstream media and fiercely denied by governments worldwide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus first came across that theory, he had been utterly shaken. Now, the map in his mind seemed to align perfectly with the one described in the Mega-Sphere Hypothesis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus quickly moved the coordinates, dragging them toward the edge of the Morvalis ice wall. At first, the area beyond was shrouded in mist, but the fog briefly cleared as he shifted the map. For a fleeting moment, barely 0.01 seconds, he caught sight of lush green continents and vast oceans lying beyond the ice wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the mist reformed, again veiling the world outside the ice wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't help but wonder if he had imagined the entire thing. Yet, the vivid image burned in his mind convinced him it was real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus tried dragging the coordinates again, determined to verify what he had seen. This time, while the fog rippled faintly, it refused to dissipate entirely. He could only glimpse a faint blue sliver beyond the ice wall. An ocean humanity had never set foot</span><span> on</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell did I just uncover? Are we really living on </span><span>just </span><span>a fraction of the Earth? How is that even possible?" For a moment, Marcus felt like his brain was short-circuiting. The revelation was too much to process, too overwhelming to believe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus even thought of exploring the Morvalis ice wall. But he quickly dismissed the idea. The sheer distance alone would drain an immense amount of his Numinous Energy.</span></p></div>
