  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man with the ponytail, Axel, gritted his teeth, snarling, "Let go of Mr. Joel McHale right now, or you're in for a world of pain!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was a fifth-generation cyborg, his strength equivalent to that of a human warrior at Ancient Martial Stage Eight. Killing Marcus would have been as easy as flicking his wrist.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus barely spared him a glance and said coolly, "A worthless pile of scrap like you isn't even qualified to speak to me. Do yourself a favor and shut up!" That single sentence shut Axel up on the spot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At almost the same moment, a sniper in the distance tried to take a shot at Cecilia, hoping to divert Marcus' attention.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What he didn't know was that the entire banquet hall had long been enveloped by Marcus' spiritual powers. In fact, with Marcus' current level of control, nothing within the McHale family's territory escaped his awareness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under Marcus' spiritual powers, every movement in the banquet hall was laid bare. The moment the sniper prepared to </span><span>fire,</span><span> he had already sensed him&mdash;then unleashed a devastating energy beam.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The beam shot forward in an instant, so fast that it reached its target before the man even had a chance to react.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, a muffled bang rang out. His head exploded on the spot, reduced to a gruesome mess of blood and bone that splattered across the floor. His body collapsed stiffly, nothing more than a corpse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The scene left everyone in the room frozen in shock. Some shuddered while others </span><span>sucked in sharp breaths. Not in their wildest dreams had they imagined Marcus possessed such terrifying power&mdash;obliterating a man from a distance with a single energy blast. It was downright insane.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus swept his gaze over the crowd, his voice ice-cold. "Don't even think about pulling any tricks in front of me. If you don't want to die, I suggest you behave!" And just his stare alone was enough to send a shiver down their spines.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Axel shot Marcus a frosty glare, saying, "Brat, I never would've guessed you were a warrior from </span><span>Uswad</span><span>. Since you claim that title, do you dare to fight me fair and square?" As he spoke, a hint of provocation flickered in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus looked at him and spoke coldly, "With that pathetic level of skill, you're not even qualified to be my opponent. You'd better know your place&mdash;otherwise, you're heading straight for a dead end."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment those words left his mouth, Joel and the others froze for a split second before sneering. Axel, in particular, smirked with pure disdain, "I have no idea where you got the guts to run your mouth like that, but let's see if you're really as tough as you think you are!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He seemed to take Marcus' words as a challenge, his competitive streak fully ignited. As he spoke, his mechanical arm suddenly shot forward, lunging toward Marcus with a sharp, predatory force.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The arm extended unnaturally, stretching further and further as if powered by immense strength. Against an ordinary opponent, it would have been nearly impossible to counter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus? He just smirked, the taunting curve of his lips making it clear he wasn't the least bit fazed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as the mechanical arm was about to come crashing down, everyone saw Marcus' hand flick downward in a swift, precise motion. In that instant, he seemed to transform into a blade of pure force&mdash;silent, deadly, unstoppable. In the blink of an eye, his hand met the descending arm, and with a sharp squelch, a muffled tearing sound echoed through the air.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As quick as a wink, Axel's mechanical arm was severed clean off. It flew through the air, landing with a clatter, a mess of shattered metal and torn flesh spilling across the ground in a grisly display.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Axel then let out a bloodcurdling scream, staggering back involuntarily. His face turned ashen as he stared in shock at the stump where his arm used to be. He had never, not even in his worst nightmares, imagined Marcus was this strong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's just a pile of scrap metal," Marcus scoffed, his voice dripping with contempt. "And you thought you could show off with that in front of me? What a joke." Even with their numbers, he remained utterly unfazed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Almost immediately, two figures emerged from the shadows&mdash;5th-generation cyborgs, their movements perfectly synchronized as they stepped forward to surround Marcus. "You're getting </span><span>real</span><span> cocky," one of them sneered. "Looks like we'll have to take you down together!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
