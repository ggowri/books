        <h1>Chapter 146 Take It Over</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Toby screamed in pain, his body curling up like a boiled shrimp, wailing in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He howled, "Let me go right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus twisted his wrist and snapped Toby's arm. He casually threw the machete on the ground and looked down at Toby, saying, "With your level of strength, you dare to act tough in front of me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas and Stanley stood frozen, disbelief etched on their faces as they watched the scene unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Toby, a formidable presence who could take down a hundred thugs</span><span> alone</span><span>, couldn't even withstand one move from Marcus. It was unbelievable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go back and tell the head of the Shadow Syndicate to come and see me right away!" Marcus said coldly to Toby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't want to waste time on these insignificant people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as he can make the head of the Shadow Syndicate submit, he will be able to take over the entire organization!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Toby clutched his broken arm and staggered to his feet, looking at Marcus with eyes full of fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!" He gestured to the person beside him and quickly left the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine, Laura, and Philip looked at Marcus with </span><span>extreme</span><span> shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never expected that even Toby leading dozens of thugs couldn't do anything to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, you've really stirred up trouble. Even though you're tough, you not only beat up Toby but also openly challenged Hank Vickers, the boss of the Shadow Syndicate. If he really comes, you'll be in for a very bad time!" Thomas said with a hint of </span><span>mockery</span><span> on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Marcus was indeed capable of fighting, facing the entire Shadow Syndicate alone meant he's on a dead-end path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at Thomas, finally unable to hold back, and said, "I've been putting up with you for Catherine's sake. You'd better shut your mouth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus angry, Thomas immediately dared not speak anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was just a person with a loose tongue, fond of provoking others with words but getting scared stiff once they were irritated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus ignored Thomas and said to Catherine, "I can handle the Shadow Syndicate myself. You take Laura upstairs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine was still somewhat worried, but she nodded nonetheless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since there was almost nothing she could help with, she took Laura upstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Driven by curiosity, Philip stayed to watch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five minutes later, a strong gust of wind swept across the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus and the others couldn't help but look up, seeing a black helicopter rapidly approaching and landing in the courtyard of the complex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several people stepped down from the helicopter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader, dressed in a blue suit with white hair and beard, still appeared to be full of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Toby and the others followed behind, their presence completely overshadowed by this person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was none other than Hank, the head of the Shadow Syndicate!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you going to kneel and welcome Mr. Vickers?" a voice came from behind Hank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus furrowed his brow and waved his hand, causing a light of thunder to descend from the void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment those words left the man's lips, his head exploded, and he died instantly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Toby and the others were so surprised they couldn't speak, their eyes widening in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... You are a Wizard..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never </span><span>thought</span><span> that Marcus was actually a Wizard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant that if Marcus had wanted to end his life just now, he could have done so with just a wave of his hand!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't push your luck, young man!" Hank glared at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, you have two choices. First, submit to me, or second, die!" Marcus said coldly to Hank. He wanted a quick resolution and didn't want to waste any more time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hank sneered, "I get it. Tory must have died at your hands, but I'm not him. It's your turn to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he finished speaking, his body was enveloped by a strange light and vanished from the spot...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus furrowed his brow, thinking, "He can actually teleport?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus instantly thought of a word: metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hank must be a metahuman, though his level wasn't very high; he only had control over the ability to teleport.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without time to think much, Marcus used telepathy to barely lock onto Hank's location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hank hadn't realized that Marcus had already mastered telepathy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered and prepared to launch a surprise attack on Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before Hank could reveal himself, Marcus lunged directly towards an open space!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hank let out a scream of terror, his face suddenly contorted with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body, hidden in the air, instantly materialized, and Marcus grabbed him by the neck, lifting him high into the air!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Y-you're still a warrior... How is this possible?" Hank said, disbelief evident in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus </span><span>u</span><span>sed Lightning just now, but given how he captured Hank, he was obviously a powerful warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was hard for Hank to imagine that one person could possess both the powers of a Wizard and a warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, don't kill me. I'll surrender to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing the powerful aura released by Marcus, fear took over Hank's heart, and all thoughts of resistance vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I gave you a chance just now, but you didn't cherish it. It's too late to surrender!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Marcus twisted Hank's neck directly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a desperate face, his head hung limply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Marcus cast his body away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A luxurious convoy of cars came speeding along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The four high-ranking managers of the Shadow Syndicate arrived together, bowing to Marcus one after another, saying, "Welcome, new leader!"</span></p></div>
