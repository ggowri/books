  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had already decided&mdash;she wouldn't refund the deposit, nor would she return the rent Kiera had prepaid for half a year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was intent on making Kiera and Marcus, whom she had dismissed as nobodies, pay a heavy price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Helen finished speaking, many of the neighbors shot pitying glances at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although they all knew that Helen was in the wrong, it made no difference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her husband was the deputy chief of the police precinct in this area and could easily crush the two young people like insects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many of the neighbors began urging Marcus to leave with Kiera as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded gratefully at them and then turned to Helen. "I've heard that your husband has been involved in embezzlement and bribery, and even shelters criminals. Is that true?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen froze for a moment, but she wasn't stupid and quickly denied it. "Don't slander my husband! He's a good cop, always serving the people. He's never done any of those things you're accusing him of. If you keep making up lies, when my husband arrives, he'll make sure you're punished even worse. He'll add more years to your sentence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus wasn't bothered by her threat. He simply asked, "If that's not true, then how did your husband, on a salary of ten or twenty thousand a month, afford to buy all those properties? Where did all that money come from?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, several of the neighbors gave Marcus knowing looks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen was often warned by her husband to keep a low profile, not to flaunt their wealth in public. But she couldn't help herself; she just had to show off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So she proudly responded, "All the money comes from my husband. What, are you jealous? What's the point of being jealous? You're just a poor nobody&mdash;if you had any skills, you could be a deputy police chief too and make money like this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't help but laugh. "So, in the end, the money your husband has came from his position as deputy police chief. Why don't you just admit it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen immediately realized she had misspoken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after a moment's thought, she figured that even if she admitted it, Marcus couldn't do anything about it&mdash;both she and her husband were untouchable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she smirked and said, "You wretch, stop trying to trick me. All our money comes from my husband's position as a deputy police chief. What are you going to do about it? Even if I admit it, all you can do is be jealous. What else can you do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll say it again: if you've got the skills, go become a deputy police chief yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While speaking, she called her husband. She explained the situation on the phone, adding some extra details to paint the picture in her favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Dexter, her husband, heard, he became furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though his wife had grown large and had been acting aggressively, she was still his woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone who bullied her was effectively bullying him. Naturally, he couldn't let this slide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he gathered a few officers from the station and stormed toward the scene, furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the deputy police chief, Dexter had plenty of ways to deal with a nobody like Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could easily plant a false charge, and Marcus wouldn't stand a chance to defend himself before being locked up for a few years, if not facing an even harsher sentence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the power Dexter held, and it was that very power that had allowed him to make so much money and protect his family from being pushed around by others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You pathetic loser, just you wait. My husband and his team will be here soon, and you'll be begging for mercy," Helen said smugly to Marcus after hanging up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her mind, her husband could solve any problem for her, and anyone who offended her would end up in a miserable situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was sure that this time would be no different, and that Marcus, who was talking tough now, would soon be on his knees begging.</span></p><div class="pagination">
