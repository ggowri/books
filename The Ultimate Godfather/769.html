        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia's face turned bright red, and she didn't answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But deep down, a flicker of anticipation for that ultimate sensation of pleasure had already taken root.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The problem was, that Nadia had no idea how to broach the topic with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, of course, was completely unaware of what the two women were discussing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the moment, he was busy treating other members of the Nuer Tribe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to his Dual Cultivation with Susan, Marcus had broken through his previous limits, achieving a noticeable boost in power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Numinous Energy within him had increased by at least a third, enabling him to assist more members of the Nuer Tribe in removing their Cursed Power in one go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three days passed in the blink of an eye. During that time, Marcus hardly rested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aside from catching an hour or two of sleep to replenish his Numinous Energy, he spent every waking moment helping the Nuer Tribe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In total, he freed nearly 200 people from the grip of their curses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These 200 individuals were almost all core elites of the tribe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The curse's removal not only liberated them but also unlocked latent potential within their bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some, like Nadia, experienced breakthroughs upon breakthroughs, shattering four stages consecutively after being unsealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These people instantly became dazzling figures in the tribe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the curse lifted from 200 individuals, the Nuer Tribe's collective strength soared by several levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Shark Tribe's chief were to lead an attack against the Nuer Tribe now, even without Marcus' help, they would crush the Shark Tribe with ease!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, thank you for all of these!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus emerged from the room, Raphael, the chief of the Nuer Tribe, bowed deeply to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald," Raphael continued, "today is the day the space-time gate opens. When do you plan to set out and explore it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied, "I have a friend on the surface. I'll bring her here first, and we'll enter the space-time gate together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In that case, we will await your return, Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raphael bowed again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the amulet in Marcus' hand began to shine with a blinding light. The pulsing glow was frantic as if urgently signaling something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus frowned at the sight, his mind racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could something </span><span>have</span><span> happened to Ada?" he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second thought, Marcus set out, accompanied by one of the Nuer Tribe members, heading toward the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After passing through a Teleportation Gate, Marcus returned to the underwater city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued swimming upward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, on the ocean's surface, Liam, Nathan, and several other </span><span>Uswad</span><span> warriors had gathered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan had fully recovered from his injuries after a few days of rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beside Nathan stood an elderly man with snow-white hair and a long beard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was none other than Alonzo Caster, the head of the Caster family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alonzo was an ancient figure in </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> world of Ancient Martial Art.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was said he had lived through multiple cycles of samsara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one knew his exact age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three days ago, Alonzo had broken through to the stage of the Ancient Martial Stage Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those three days coincided with Marcus' time in the underwater world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alonzo's breakthrough sent shockwaves through the world of Ancient Martial Art in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew of the existence of reclusive masters, their strength unfathomable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Legends spoke of those people being incredibly old, living in seclusion, and possessing immense cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But such tales were never verified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alonzo became the first to publicly declare his breakthrough into Ancient Martial Stage Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant, theoretically, he was now the most powerful expert in </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> world of Ancient Martial Art.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After completing his seclusion, Alonzo immediately made his way to the </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall region to meet Nathan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wanted to enter the space-time gate and uncover its mysteries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having reached Ancient Martial Stage Nine, Alonzo's next objective was the Return Essence stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To achieve that, he needed to find a Return Essence Crystal within the space-time gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alonzo stood with his hands behind his back, exuding an aura of invincibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he arrived, all eyes fell on him, their expressions filled with awe and reverence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had reached a level of power that none of them could even dream of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nathan," Alonzo said, his tone calm yet commanding, "where is that boy who dared attack you earlier?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that his cultivation had reached new heights, he wouldn't tolerate any insult to his family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan's gaze shifted to Ada. "Where's Marcus? Tell him to come out and face his death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada's face darkened. She hadn't expected Alonzo to break through to Ancient Martial Stage Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She replied, "Since you took so long to arrive, Marcus has already gone to explore the underwater world."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan's eyes narrowed. "How long has he been gone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three days," Ada answered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And in these three days, has there been any contact with him?" Nathan pressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada shook her head. "None."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Alonzo chuckled coldly. "That deep-sea region is teeming with monstrous creatures, not to mention the two great families guarding it. Since Marcus has been gone for three days, he's likely met his end."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan laughed along. "If he's dead, so much the better. He brought it upon himself, going down there uninvited."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Nathan's gaze swept over Ada. "With Marcus gone, why don't you just come to me instead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he talked, he leaped into the air, his large hand reaching for Ada.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Nathan was acting so arrogantly because Alonzo had broken through to the Ninth Stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperately, she tried to evade his attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the gap in their abilities was too great.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan's relentless strikes quickly forced Ada onto the defensive. Soon, she could only fend off his blows, unable to counterattack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With your meager strength, resistance is pointless. Why not just give in? Perhaps I can give you a happy life," Nathan sneered, his hand grabbing Ada's shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada struggled to break free, but Nathan slapped her hard across the face. Her cheek swelled instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bitch! I'm giving you a chance. You truly believe you're some pure girl, don't you?" Nathan snarled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, you're mine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached out to pull Ada into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd watching was furious, their faces filled with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected Nathan to stoop so low, humiliating a woman in public.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no one dared to intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They weren't strong enough to stand against Nathan. And with Alonzo present, any resistance was futile. No one dared to offend them in </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> world of Ancient Martial Art.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Ada crushed the amulet in her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that if Marcus didn't return soon, she would have a real problem.</span></p></div>
