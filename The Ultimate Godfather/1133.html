        <h1>Chapter 1000 Simply Unbelievable-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She finally understood why Gertie had tried so hard to stop her when she took action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie wasn't trying to protect Marcus; she was truly afraid he might kill Minerva in his anger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the gap in strength between Minerva and Marcus was simply too vast. She might not even withstand his casual attacks.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, she felt a tinge of guilt toward Gertie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Pedro couldn't believe it and rubbed his eyes hard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He just felt like he was hallucinating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had fought with Kyson before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As an Acquired State Seven expert, Pedro had no power to fight back and was easily subdued.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now, Kyson couldn't even withstand a single strike from Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Pedro couldn't accept it and dared not believe it was true.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The nine Grandmasters of the Leah family also looked at Marcus in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>None of them were a match for Kyson, yet Marcus could defeat him with a single strike. They thought, "How powerful must Marcus be?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The thought of how they had planned to act against Marcus before Pedro and Kyson arrived made them feel a bit scared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, a coughing sound came from the ruins of the cliff.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately after, a figure staggered to their feet from there.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was disheveled, covered in blood, and his clothes were tattered. It was none other than Kyson.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he was gravely injured and on the brink of death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at Marcus, his eyes filled with intense disbelief. His voice trembled as he asked, "Who... who are you? How do you possess such immense power?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus sneered, "This is nothing. I'm just killing an ordinary Ophidian like you. If the Ophidians from Lemuria dare to continue wreaking havoc on this continent, I won't hesitate to wipe you all out!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Kyson suddenly let out a manic and mocking laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stopped, looked at Marcus, and sneered, "Do you really think defeating me alone gives you the right to speak so arrogantly? Let me tell you the truth, if you dare kill me today, Mr. Clifford won't let you off!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even at this moment, Kyson still tried to use Roderick's reputation to threaten Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus gave him no chance. He raised his hand, pointed a finger, and a destructive beam of light descended, blasting Kyson's head apart, leaving him a headless corpse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone gasped in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Especially, the Leah family&rsquo;s gaze toward Marcus had completely changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Kyson killed, Pedro was filled with fear. For a moment, he didn&rsquo;t know what to do.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Earlier, we were reckless and offended you. Please forgive us!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Trevor stepped forward to Marcus and apologized to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other eight Grandmasters followed suit, expressing their apologies.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I have nothing to do with you. You don't need to apologize to me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus waved his hand at the nine Grandmasters.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then please help the Leah family eliminate Pedro and the Henderson family!" Trevor pleaded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Pedro was uneasy, like a lamb waiting to be slaughtered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't know whether to flee or stay.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus gave Trevor a strange look and said, "I already said, I have nothing to do with the Leah family. If it weren't for Gertie, based on what you did to me before, I could have killed all of you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How dare you ask me for help now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words left the Leah family's Grandmasters feeling awkward. They were immediately rendered speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If not for Kyson and Pedro's appearance, they might have already started a fight with Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, seeing Marcus's great strength, these nine Grandmasters want to plead for his help.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their behavior is indeed shameless, and even they feel deeply ashamed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus couldn't be bothered to deal with them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at Minerva and said coldly, "And you. If it weren't for Gertie's sake, I would have killed you long ago. I hope you won't overestimate or think too highly of yourself in the future. If you don't restrain yourself, you'll surely suffer greatly someday!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Marcus turned around, took Gertie's hand, and said, "Let's go."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was naturally amazed by his domineering side just now. She stared at him admiringly and nodded gently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately after, he used teleport and took her away from Emotionless Gorge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching them disappear from sight like that, many of the Leah family members were astonished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In their understanding, no matter how powerful a person is, they could never achieve teleport.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus and Gertie truly disappeared right before their eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They could feel that he achieved it purely through his own strength, without using any spatial artifact or amulet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They felt he was no longer human, but a deity!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Pedro not far away let out a wild and mocking laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Trevor couldn't help but ask, "Pedro, what are you laughing at?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Pedro laughed loudly, "Because the Leah family is truly ignorant. You had the chance to associate with such a powerful person. Yet, you failed to seize the opportunity and even angered him. It's absolutely ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And besides, you even wanted to deal with him before. Now, you're asking him to take action against the Henderson family. You're truly shameless."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Pedro's mocking words, many from the Leah family felt regret and shame, as if they had been slapped in the face!</span></p></div>
