  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lake... What did you say? I didn't quite catch that..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade asked in disbelief, her words becoming somewhat incoherent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said, I officially appoint you as the Vice President of </span><span>Solomia</span><span> Hospital."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carter repeated his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Jade finally heard him clearly, and her heart began to tremble uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lake, I was just promoted to the head of the surgery department two months ago, and now you want to make me the vice president? Isn't that a bit too soon? Will the other department heads have any objections?" Jade asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had only transferred from </span><span>Solariae</span><span> Hospital to </span><span>Solomia</span><span> Hospital less than two months ago, starting as an ordinary doctor, then being promoted to department head, and now she was being made vice president.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a rapid rise was unprecedented, not just in </span><span>Solomia</span><span> Hospital, but probably in the entire </span><span>Uswad</span><span> medical field.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade was worried that her promotion might attract criticism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Given your contributions to </span><span>Solomia</span><span> Hospital, not only should you be the vice president, but even if I retire, you could be the hospital president, and no one would have any objections. Don't worry about it!" Carter assured her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The special patented medicine developed by </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span> had incredibly high medicinal value for surgical procedures, the treatment of surgical conditions, and post-surgical care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once it was launched, it became a global sensation, elevating the international reputation of </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> surgical drugs to new heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Major hospitals across </span><span>Uswad</span><span> scrambled to purchase it, but there was always a shortage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it was because of Jade that </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span> had signed an exclusive agency contract with their hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Solomia</span><span> Hospital's ranking in </span><span>Uswad</span><span> had always hovered around the top ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was far from being on par with top-tier hospitals like Kingston and </span><span>Solariae</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logically speaking, even with the exclusive agency contract, it shouldn't have been </span><span>Solomia</span><span> Hospital that got it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But all of this was thanks to Jade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through his own investigation, Carter had discovered that Jade's boyfriend was Marcus, the man behind the recent buzz in </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> business world&mdash;Death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carter was a man who understood human relationships well. By promoting Jade to vice president, he knew that when the time came and he needed Marcus' help, Marcus would be more than willing to assist out of gratitude for the favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing Carter's words, Jade reluctantly accepted the position, though she still felt uneasy after hanging up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Promoted to vice president, congratulations," Marcus said to Jade, his large hand still massaging her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Jade's mind was preoccupied with other thoughts, and she paid little attention to Marcus' hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've only been at </span><span>Solomia</span><span> Hospital for less than two months, and now I've been promoted twice. Both of these promotions are related to you, especially this one. Mr. Lake must have promoted me to vice president because of your influence," Jade said casually, her tone certain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a smart girl, and with just a little thought, she could understand the ins and outs of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Marcus' hand seemed to grow bolder, even slipping inside her nightgown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was when Jade finally reacted, her face turning bright red. "You bad guy, taking advantage of me like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus laughed, "What do you mean 'taking advantage'? I've touched you before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade shot Marcus a glare. "I'm talking about something </span><span>serious,</span><span> can't you be more serious?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled. "Getting promoted to vice president? That's all your own doing, what does it have to do with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade pouted. "I know my own worth. The president must have promoted me because of your influence."</span></p><div class="pagination">
