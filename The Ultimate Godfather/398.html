  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sheila's face looked ugly, and she asked Scales, "Honey, is what he said true? What should we do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Scales had a panicked expression on his face. Just as he was about to make a call, his phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Scales, Golden Group has decided to cancel all cooperation with you. Come over tomorrow to get your salary."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The person who called him was from the finance department of Golden Group to inform Scales to settle his salary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Scales' body trembled as if lightning struck him, and he almost fell to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everything is over. Now that I have been disqualified from cooperating with Golden Group, other pharmaceutical companies will no longer dare to cooperate with me..." Scales said, his face full of despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone present was also stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They didn't expect that Scales would be disqualified from cooperation just because he offended Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It meant that Golden Group valued Marcus a lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of the consequences he was about to face, Scales knelt down in front of the HR manager Alfred. He hugged his thighs and begged, "Sir, please plead with Ms. Smith. This cooperation is important to me. I can't lose it. Please!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfred glanced at Scales, his eyes full of contempt. "What's the point of you asking me for help? You should beg Mr. Fitzgerald, do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Scales finally reacted. Without caring about his face, he crawled to Marcus and begged, "Mr. Fitzgerald, I'm sorry. I didn't recognize you and offended you. Please forgive me and ask Golden Group to continue cooperating with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus crossed his legs and glanced at Scales. "You like to play tricks and take advantage of loopholes. You are not suitable for cooperation with Golden Group. You should find another partner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Scales looked completely desperate. Marcus had cut off his source of income.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stood up, glaring at Marcus. "I begged you just now because I respected you, but I didn't expect that you wouldn't give me any face at all. Catherine and Sheila were elementary school classmates. Do you think that you can be so arrogant just because you have a relationship with Golden Group?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Cutting off my source of income is the same as taking my life. Since you don't want me to live, I will also kill you. Just wait here. I will break both of your arms today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While speaking, Scales dialed a phone call. After hanging up the phone, he became more confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Scales, you'd better not do anything disrespectful to Mr. Fitzgerald. Otherwise, Golden Group will not let you go." Alfred warned Scales.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Scales sneered, "Golden Group has canceled the cooperation with me. I'm not afraid of you. I will make both of you pay the price today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, he blocked the door to the private room, afraid that Marcus and Alfred would escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many students were panicked, especially the female students.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They never thought that the class reunion would end up like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seemed that Scales had found a powerful person to deal with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though Marcus held an important position in Golden Group, if Scales were determined to deal with him, someone would get hurt today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Several classmates stepped forward to dissuade Scales, but Scales was not moved at all. Instead, he became more and more arrogant. "Since he cut off my source of income, he must pay the price!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sheila was nervous, but after a moment, she showed a resolute look on her face. "Honey, I stand on your side. This guy disregards our classmate's friendship and insists on canceling the cooperation. I support you in teaching him a lesson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Scales rubbed Sheila's head with a doting look on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry, Sheila. Even if I don't cooperate with Golden Group, I will go to other cities to find cooperation targets. I believe that with my years of hard work in this industry, I will finally succeed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But before that, I must teach this guy a lesson to vent my anger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Scales asked for help from Toby from Serpent's Coil and promised to give him a reward of five million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby agreed and rushed over here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sheila, I advise you to persuade Scales. He can't beat Marcus. If the matter gets out of hand, you two will get hurt." Catherine said to dissuade Sheila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had witnessed Marcus' powerful personal strength and extensive connections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Catherine's opinion, Marcus knew everyone in Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, the person Scales asked here was most likely someone Marcus knew.</span></p><div class="pagination">
