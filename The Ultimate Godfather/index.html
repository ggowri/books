        <h1>Chapter 1 Betrayal-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You loser! How dare you do this to me - I'm your mother-in-law! Stop... Oh God... Mmm..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up, slut. Abigail betrayed me and tried to have me killed with her lover. Since she's not around, I might as well enjoy her stepmom's company. Don't act innocent - I saw you touching yourself earlier. Luckily I'm here to help. You're practically begging for it!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the shadowy hallway of the luxury mansion, Marcus Fitzgerald had a sultry, alluring woman pinned against the wall.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her perfect curves pressed tightly against him, and Marcus wasted no time indulging himself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mouth found her neck, trailing hot kisses down to her generous cleavage.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, his warm lips captured her nipple, making her ample breasts distorted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His skilled hands slipped under her skirt, the quiet buzz of a vibrator adding to the erotic tension.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman's breath came in ragged gasps, her head falling back as waves of pleasure coursed through her body. Each moan that escaped her lips was deep and needy, her body arching desperately against his.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane Winchester wasn't just any woman - she was Marcus' wife, Abigail Winchester's stepmother.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just yesterday, Marcus' world imploded when he discovered his wife's betrayal. Abigail had been screwing Felix Yannis, Golden Group's deputy GM, behind his back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Marcus found out, Abigail showed her true colors. That heartless witch teamed up with her lover in no time and tried to murder him - beat him, tied him up, and dumped him in the ocean like garbage.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they didn't count on one thing - a pendant an old man had given Marcus three years ago saved him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That mysterious pendant somehow helped him wriggle free from those ropes and pop back up to the surface. And it did more than that - it filled him with superhuman strength</span><span> that was hard to imagine</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furious, Marcus stormed over to their place to confront Abigail but found only her stepmother instead.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, someone's gonna pay!" he'd growled, eyes dark with vengeance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop it," Jane gasped, writhing against him. "You bastard, let go of me! Natalia's studying in the living room. You... you can't just go at it like this. Hmm... What... what if she hears? God, I can't..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why has this timid loser Marcus transformed into such a dominant beast?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How on earth does he find the nerve to touch me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But damn... it feels so good.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At barely thirty, Jane was in her sexual prime. Years of widowhood had left her desperate for touch.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, trapped in Marcus's game of pleasure and revenge, she was on the verge of losing it. Her body betrayed her, craving more with every touch.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the thought of her stepdaughter, Natalia Winchester, sitting out in the living room, innocent and focused on her schoolwork, jolted Jane back to reality.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the last shred of her self-restraint, Jane dug in her heels and fought to break free from Marcus' iron grip.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quiet down, bitch. You're loving every second of this, aren't you? Why keep fighting it? Isn't it fun, eh?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus brooked no delay. He cranked up the vibrator to maximum, his movements growing more intense.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You stupid jerk... Let me go! Stop or you'll regret it-"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of pleasure cut off her threat. She clamped both hands over her mouth, terrified Natalia would hear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom? What's that? Everything okay in there?" Natalia called from the living room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing, I'm... fine, sweetie. Just... focus on your homework," Jane managed weakly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was being brutally fucked by Marcus' electric tool while trying to suppress her physical reactions, all the while answering Natalia. Her heart thundered in her chest.</span></p></div>
