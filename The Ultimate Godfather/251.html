  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two spells, </span><span>Frostbind</span><span> and </span><span>Stormcall</span><span>, seemed to fall into the entry-level category. Their power was comparable to that of Fireball and Lightning&mdash;effective, but not particularly outstanding on their own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Marcus had recently mastered a technique that fused magic with ancient martial arts moves, which significantly amplified the impact of otherwise ordinary spells. With these two new additions, his range of attack and adaptability would undoubtedly reach new heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he could also teach these spells to members of Serpent's Coil, further strengthening their capabilities. The night passed uneventfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, Marcus drove his Aston Martin to Serpent's Coil to check on their progress in mastering magic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unsurprisingly, Jalen stood out as the most talented in the group when it came to magic. His mastery of Fireball and Lightning had reached the peak of a Level 2 mage, making him as powerful as a Stage Two martial arts expert. This level of strength was practically unmatched in Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, Marcus had always emphasized the importance of keeping a low profile. "Unless it's absolutely necessary, don't show off your abilities," he had warned. Jalen </span><span>took his advice seriously and had spent most of his time training rather than going out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest of the magic team had also made notable progress, with most members nearing the peak of Level 1. Meanwhile, Edgar's ancient martial arts training was coming along nicely. With the help of the pills Marcus had given him, he had reached a level comparable to a half-step warrior, giving him newfound hope and motivation. He now spent most of his days fully immersed in training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving Serpent's Coil, Marcus visited the pharmaceutical factory construction site. The factory buildings were nearly completed and were now entering the interior renovation phase&mdash;a process even more critical and time-consuming than constructing the framework.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus wasn't in a hurry, though. While the original timeline estimated another month and a half before completion, the current progress suggested the project could be wrapped up in about 20 days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also reached out to Josie to check on the progress of the pharmaceutical production lines. Her response aligned almost perfectly with the factory's expected completion date. In short, if everything went smoothly, the pharmaceutical company could officially begin production in just 20 days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was planning a trip to the southwestern region of </span><span>Uswad</span><span> in two days to investigate a potential energy crystal mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that the crystals were exorbitantly priced and that owning an entire mine would cost an astronomical amount. Even with hundreds of billions in his account, he was still far from being able to afford one. This made the pharmaceutical company's production schedule all the more urgent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To get an update on Golden Group's recent revenue, Marcus headed to the office. Michelle was now the official chairwoman of Golden Group, occupying the office that had once been his. The door lock was fingerprint-enabled, and Marcus casually unlocked it with his fingerprint before stepping inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as he entered, he was hit with a scene that stopped him in his tracks. Michelle was reclined in her executive chair, legs parted. In her hand was a buzzing device, which she was pressing against her most intimate spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hum of the motor filled the air, blending with Michelle's breathy moans. Her face was flushed, eyes tightly shut, completely lost in her pleasure. "Marcus... hurry... I can't wait any longer... please!" she murmured, her voice laced with desperation as she moved the device rhythmically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus stood frozen, watching the usually composed and elegant Michelle indulge in a side of herself he'd never seen. His unexpected entrance startled her out of her trance. Her eyes snapped open, and she gasped in shock, the device slipping from her trembling hand and falling to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus? What are you doing here?" she stammered, her face flushing even deeper as she fumbled to fix her clothes and regain her composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think I'm doing?" Marcus smirked, taking a slow step closer. "The real question is, what were you doing just now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle's flushed expression and uninhibited actions were enough to stir a reaction in Marcus, sending a faint heat coursing through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never would have imagined that the usually gentle and demure Michelle had this side to her. While she had always been </span><span>tender</span><span> and affectionate when they were intimate, seeing her like this&mdash;uninhibited and entirely lost in her desires&mdash;was something else entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I wasn't doing anything," Michelle stammered, her voice high-pitched with embarrassment. "And why didn't you knock before coming in? You're so annoying, </span><span>Marcus." Her cheeks were red, her flustered demeanor making her look utterly mortified. Being caught in such a compromising situation was nothing short of a nightmare for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled, his tone teasing, "Not doing anything? Michelle, I saw everything. Do you still want to deny it?" As he spoke, he closed the distance between them, his gaze steady and full of mischief. Before Michelle could utter a coherent response, Marcus reached out and pulled her into his arms with an easy, practiced confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..." Michelle gasped against his lips, her voice rising in a sharp, breathless cry. The warmth of his touch, the sheer dominance in his embrace&mdash;it was nothing like the cold, mechanical device she had been using.</span></p><div class="pagination">
