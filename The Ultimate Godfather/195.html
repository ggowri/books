        <h1>Chapter 194 I Feel Great</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sight of Natalia's happy look, Marcus was completely aroused, and he began to thrust more frantically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the midst of an orgasm, she felt a fluid flow from her vagina, which immediately gave her more intense sexual pleasure.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her screams became louder and more alluring!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was thrusting in and out while changing positions. Natalia was overwhelmed by the strong desire, and her mind went blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt completely empty, as if everything in the world had lost its meaning at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She completely immersed herself in the excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, fuck me harder... I feel great. I like you to fuck me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia kept caressing Marcus. When his movements became more violent, her nails even became embedded in his flesh, the blood faintly visible.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he ignored the pain. As Natalia's vagina continued to contract, he was also immersed in the excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had sex for an hour and a half.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus moved rapidly and finally came.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Natalia was lying limply on the bed, her whole body flushed and bathed in sweat.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her private part was still contracting and trembling rhythmically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus wiped the sweat from his forehead and asked, "Are you comfortable?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia nodded subconsciously. "Marcus, I feel great. You are amazing. I love you so much. Please don't leave me in the future, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Silly girl, I will never leave you," Marcus smiled. Then, he pulled her into his arms and kissed her sweetly and passionately again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the next period of time, he made love to her three times, and it was not until three o'clock in the morning that they fell into a deep sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia was immersed in delight all night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus got up at eight o'clock in the morning, she was still sleeping soundly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, what time is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long while, Natalia's soft voice rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's 8:10," Marcus replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? It's already 8:10! Why didn't you wake me up earlier? I have classes in the morning!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia jumped out of the bed and ran into the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After washing up quickly, she sat down to put on makeup. "Marcus, it's all your fault. You kept me up all night. Otherwise, I wouldn't have been late!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She complained about Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled helplessly, "Are you blaming me? Last night, when I asked you to sleep, you insisted on having sex again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia retorted, "Oh, stop it. That wasn't me. It must be you. You are a pervert. I definitely will never say something like that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' words made her blush again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, she had just finished washing up, so she was stunning now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It only took Natalia fifteen minutes to finish her makeup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, she was quite pretty without makeup, and she looked even more delicate and radiant with makeup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She put on her clothes and asked, "Marcus, how many days do you plan to stay in Kingston? When will you leave?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am not sure yet. Probably about a week or so."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia said obediently, "Oh, our dormitory has very strict inspections. I didn't go back last night, so I should be punished. But it's okay if I can be with you, Marcus. I can't come out tonight, and you have to behave yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. You are still young, so you should focus on your studies."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm mature. My breasts are full."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia stuck out her tongue, revealing a playful look. "Okay, I won't joke with you anymore. I'm going to school now. Goodbye, Marcus!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pushed the door and left the hotel room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staring at the pure, lovely, and energetic girl, Marcus really liked her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he came to Kingston to treat Grace's illness and to meet Natalia and Josie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He planned to find Josie after discussing business matters with the four group presidents in the morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At ten o'clock in the morning, Marcus finished washing up and went to the presidential suite of the hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he arrived, four presidents, who were already waiting at the door, all greeted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus wanted to meet them mainly to understand the operating conditions of the four groups and matters related to talent transfer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what had happened in Harvey's villa yesterday, Lester's eyes on Marcus were obviously different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus did not mention that matter. He spent the whole conversation talking about the business deployment of the four groups.</span></p></div>
