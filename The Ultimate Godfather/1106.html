  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the </span><span>barrier</span><span> continued to weaken</span><span>, more and more outsiders w</span><span>ould</span><span> </span><span>pour in</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And this was just the beginning.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If that</span><span> was</span><span> true, then in the long run, this world might face much killing and turmoil.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Looks like you really have a death wish!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>T</span><span>he </span><span>elder</span><span>'s tone suddenly turned icy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they spoke, </span><span>their</span><span> extremely eerie aura </span><span>was giving </span><span>off a deeply sinister feeling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Several people quickly surrounded </span><span>Marcus</span><span> in the center. A tall, thin man with a sallow complexion wore a sinister smile, his gaze at </span><span>Marcus</span><span> revealing a hint of greed. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "His body is so strong. I want to capture him, torture him to death bit by bit, and then drain all the energy from his body for my use!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A</span><span> strange smile also appeared on the faces of the others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The old man said, "You've always liked men, and this kid's physique does look good. He's all yours!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, the smile on the sallow-faced man's face instantly disappeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He reached out a large hand and fiercely grabbed toward </span><span>Marcus</span><span>, just like catching a chick!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Courting death!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus</span><span> let out a cold laugh and casually threw a punch.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A blinding Fist Ray</span><span> descended.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the next moment, a terrifying rumble echoed, and an incredibly destructive force spread in all directions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The attacks of the two collided in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sallow-faced man initially wore an extremely smug smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But after sensing the terrifying destructive power within </span><span>Marcus</span><span>'s </span><span>F</span><span>ist </span><span>Ray</span><span>, his smile vanished instantly, replaced by a look of shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How is this possible? </span><span>You are just</span><span> a prisoner in a cage</span><span>! </span><span>How can be so powerful?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, before he could finish speaking, under the force of that destructive power, his body exploded into pieces, killed with a single punch!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This scene made everyone gasp in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If </span><span>Marcus</span><span>'s </span><span>first kill was a surprise, t</span><span>hen now, it's absolutely a display of strength!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This prisoner's strength is extraordinary. We must not be careless. Attack together and kill him!"</span><span> </span><span>The </span><span>elder</span><span> said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The others immediately nodded in agreement, preparing to attack </span><span>Marcus</span><span> together.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Whoosh!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, just as the old man's words fell, a sound of something piercing through the air echoed from the void.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next moment, a destructive streak of light descended like thunder, reaching the old man's body in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The old man's expression turned horrified as he instantly sensed the terrifying power contained within the destructive light.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>H</span><span>e tried</span><span> to dodge with all his might, but it was already too late!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The destructive light was not only incredibly fast but also contained an immensely powerful </span><span>B</span><span>inding </span><span>F</span><span>orce, directly holding his body in place, unable to move an inch!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No, I don't want to die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching the destructive light grow larger in his pupils, the </span><span>elder</span><span> let out a desperate cry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He tried to use the last bit of potential within his body to break free from the binding force, but it was futile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next moment, everyone heard a terrifying explosion. Under the impact of the destructive light, the old man's head was blasted apart on the spot, leaving him a headless corpse!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The others gasped in shock, never expecting this young man, who looked barely in his twenties, to be so powerful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He</span><span> was completely different from the prisoners they knew in the cage</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>He was </span><span>so </span><span>terrifying</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the prodigies from their homeland might not be any stronger!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Run!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the </span><span>elder</span><span> was killed by </span><span>Marcus</span><span> in one strike, everyone's first thought was to flee, and they immediately prepared to scatter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But how could </span><span>Marcus</span><span> give them a chance?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He raised his hand, and several deadly lightning tribulations descended from the sky.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Purple lightning flickered with endless destructive light, striking down on the remaining individuals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With several explosive sounds, their bodies were shattered by the power of the lightning, turning into clouds of blood mist that scattered with the wind!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This scene left </span><span>Gertie</span><span> trembling with fear in the distance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although she had already </span><span>knew that</span><span> </span><span>Marcus</span><span> was </span><span>terrifying, it had never been as direct as this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It&rsquo;s worth noting that her cultivation had significantly improved compared to the last time she met </span><span>Marcus</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her personal strength was no longer what it used to be, yet when facing these people, she could only defend without the ability to fight back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was even about to die at the hands of these people.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But these people were no different from ants when facing </span><span>Marcus</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus</span><span> casually waved his hand to launch an attack, and these people could hardly resist, </span><span>and were squashed</span><span> in an instant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such power was beyond words to describe</span><span>.</span><span> </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I</span><span>n </span><span>Gertie</span><span>'s eyes, </span><span>Marcus</span><span> was simply not human, no different from a monster.</span></p><div class="pagination">
