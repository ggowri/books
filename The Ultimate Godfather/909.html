  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Tobias had always been loyal to the McHale family, his blood boiled when he heard about Cecilia publicly slapping his daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Tobias finally realized a harsh truth! No matter how much he contributed to the McHale family, they would always treat him like nothing more than </span><span>a puppy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could trample his daughter's dignity without a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, when Joel plotted to seize the position of the family patriarch, Tobias saw his opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobias approached Joel and pledged his unwavering loyalty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joel was thrilled, as he only needed one final push to claim the patriarch position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been lacking dedicated supporters like Tobias in his corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Tobias' backing, Joel's path to becoming the family patriarch became much smoother and started progressing at lightning speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, their grand plan was finally about to come to fruition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joel had promised Tobias that once he became the family patriarch, Tobias would receive 20% of McHale Pharmaceuticals Group's shares.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It meant Tobias would no longer be another employee working for the McHale family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would become an actual shareholder with absolute power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His daughter Luna would never have to face bullying or humiliation again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Luna recalled these events, the last shred of guilt in her heart completely vanished into thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While she treated Cecilia like a noble lady, how did Cecilia view her in return?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sometimes, being too kind-hearted just wasn't worth it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was truth to the saying that the nicer you were, the more people would walk all over you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Luna, look! They've brought Marcus here too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Albert's gaze fell on Marcus, who stood beside Cecilia, his eyes flashing with intense coldness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert remembered the incident at Golden Pharmaceutical Manufacture, where he and Luna had gone to acquire the drug patents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had brutally attacked him without warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had broken his arm and left him with multiple fractures across his body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Luna hadn't rushed him back to </span><span>Acoton</span><span> and arranged treatment with the top orthopedic specialists, his fate would have been sealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just thinking about the excruciating </span><span>pain</span><span> he had endured that day made Albert's hatred reach its boiling point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert fixed his ice-cold gaze on Marcus, his eyes filled with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna's gaze also shifted to Marcus, and a sneer appeared on her beautiful face. "Well, well, looks like Cecilia went to </span><span>Uswad</span><span> to find this bastard. How convenient that Haywood and his people brought him back to </span><span>Acoton</span><span>. Once Mr. McHale's appointment is complete, I'll ensure this guy pays dearly for what he did. I'll get revenge for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert nodded repeatedly at Luna's words while a cruel smile spread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of finally being able to torture Marcus filled him with immense satisfaction, and he couldn't wait for that moment to arrive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecilia and Marcus couldn't help but notice Luna, Albert, and Tobias standing with Joel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The smile on Cecilia's face instantly faded as she remarked, "I never thought Tobias </span><span>and Luna would have already sided with Joel. I guess I was too naive, thinking too highly of this father-daughter duo."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes flickered as he spoke, "To be honest, I could tell Luna had issues with you back in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>, but I couldn't say anything then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe this is for the best. You only see people's true colors when you're at your lowest point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This gathering is the perfect opportunity to weed out those plotting against you behind the scenes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecilia clenched her fists at Marcus' words, anger welling inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Marcus had made a valid point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the reality of her current situation made her deflate almost immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a heavy sigh, she said, "You're right. Only when you hit rock bottom can you tell who's genuine and fake; look at Luna and Tobias.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Speaking of Tobias, if it weren't for my father taking him under his wing back then, he'd still be some apprentice blacksmith, barely scraping by on a pittance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My father brought him in and groomed him step by step to become the CEO of McHale Pharmaceuticals Group, but success went straight to his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's completely forgotten his humble beginnings and everything my father did for him. He thinks he's one of the rightful owners of McHale Pharmaceuticals Group!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's why when I treated his daughter like an employee should be treated, he took it personally and jumped ship to Joel's side!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was sharp enough to read the situation and figure out what was happening in Tobias and Luna's minds with a glance.</span></p><div class="pagination">
