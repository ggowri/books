  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone said, "Isn't this Haley, the heir of TreatMed Pharmaceuticals? Who is that guy? How dare he beat Haley in public? He is so bold!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another man said, "Yes. I heard that a big shot from Kingston came to TreatMed Pharmaceuticals. Haley came here to arrange entertainment for that big shot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another woman said, "We're in for a treat this time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was talking, and they all looked at Marcus with a bit of pity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Solomia, Haley was a well-known playboy. Wherever he appeared, others stayed away from him for fear of angering him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their opinion, Marcus, who dared to attack Haley, was doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, the nightclub manager, Dave Fergus, came quickly with a group of thugs. "Who dares to cause trouble here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haley pointed at Marcus angrily. "It's this country bumpkin. I'm the top VIP here, and my annual consumption exceeds 10 million dollars. You must give me an explanation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that the person being beaten was Haley, Dave felt a cold sweat immediately break out on his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Marcus and said coldly, "You are really stupid. You even dare to beat up the top VIP member of our nightclub. You're simply looking for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While speaking, Dave gave orders to the thugs behind him to beat Marcus, each of whom held an iron rod and looked ferocious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne was so frightened that her face turned pale. She tightly grasped Marcus' arm and said in a trembling voice, "Marcus, let's leave now. You will suffer here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She believed although Marcus was a rich and powerful senior executive of Golden Group, he was definitely no match for these people, so she wanted him to leave for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave Yvonne a reassuring look and asked Dave, "If I remember correctly, this place should be under the protection of Jalen, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jalen Zafer was the top fighter working for Edgar Trevino, the leader of the Seven Stars Association of the Serpent's Coil. With his desperate spirit, he had made a name for himself in the underground world of Solomia and was very famous in this area now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Marcus calling Jalen by his name, Dave was stunned at first and then showed an angry expression, saying, "How dare you call Mr. Zafer by his name? Don't scare me with Mr. Zafer. I have seen many people like you. Do you really think you could know a big shot like Mr. Zafer by ordering a few bottles of Champagne Armand de Brignac? How ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne didn't believe that Marcus knew Jalen, either, because Golden Group was engaged in legitimate business and seemed to have no dealings with the Serpent's Coil, in her understanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop wasting time with this country bumpkin. Help me break his limbs, and I'll take the consequences!" Haley encouraged Dave from the side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Today, no matter how outrageous my actions are, I have Leo's support."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of the Brown family was enough to handle everything. Therefore, Haley was fearless and wanted to take this opportunity to kill Marcus. The thugs were rubbing their hands, ready to take action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Dave's phone call rang at this time. He was about to curse when he saw Jalen's name. His expression immediately became respectful. "Mr. Zafer, what can I do for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You almost got us into big trouble. Do you think you can offend Mr. Fitzgerald? Apologize to Mr. Fitzgerald immediately!" said Jalen angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dave was a little confused. "Mr. Fitzgerald? Who is Mr. Fitzgerald?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jalen said, "Idiot. That's the guy standing opposite you!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
