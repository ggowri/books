  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter's face darkened with anger. "What? Fifty million? You're being absurdly greedy, young man! Don't push your luck!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus simply smiled. "You've misunderstood me. I'm not talking about fifty million&mdash;or even five hundred million. I want fifty billion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fifty billion, and I'll grant you the rights to early production."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words left Walter and Josie completely stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, they thought they had misheard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fifty billion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was this guy serious?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It sounded like a cruel joke aimed at Walter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter wasn't a fool and quickly caught on. "Fifty billion? Are you kidding me? Even if I sold your entire family, it wouldn't be worth that much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's expression turned cold. "If you can't come up with fifty billion, then we're done here. I'll count to three, and you'd better be gone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He began counting, his voice calm but unyielding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter, seething with fury, clenched his teeth. "You little punk! How dare you&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter lunged forward, his anger getting the better of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't hesitate. With a single, sharp slap, he sent Walter sprawling to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood splattered as teeth flew, and Walter let out a pained scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dare lay a hand on me? I'll kill you!" Walter staggered to his feet, throwing a punch in Marcus's direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus easily caught his wrist and, using his opponent's momentum, sent Walter flying across the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He crashed to the floor with a loud thud, disoriented and groaning in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter's two assistants froze in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their boss&mdash;an influential figure, a relative of the powerful Brown family from Kingston, and a deputy CEO at AquaVital Pharmaceuticals&mdash;had just been thoroughly humiliated in the office of BioFusion Pharmaceuticals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter, still reeling from the blow, was helped to his feet by his assistants. Blood dripped from his mouth as he glared venomously at Marcus. "You've got guts. Hitting me? You're dead meat. You won't make it out of Kingston alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to Josie, he spat. "And you! Bitch, don't think owning a company makes you untouchable. I'll crush your pathetic little business into the ground. You'll pay the price for siding with this bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Walter, supported by his assistants, hobbled toward the office door, still shouting threats. "Stay right here if you've got the guts. I'll be back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't be bothered with a bully like Walter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lit a cigarette and leaned back on the sofa, exhaling a cloud of smoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie, however, was in a panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't anticipated things escalating to this point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter's influence could spell disaster for BioFusion Pharmaceuticals&mdash;and for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, Walter is a dangerous man. You've landed yourself in big trouble. It's best you leave Kingston immediately. I'll handle the fallout," Josie's voice trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt indebted to Marcus for saving Vincent's life and easing her chronic pain. She couldn't stand to see him suffer because of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was reasonable for her to help Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus merely chuckled. "People like him only become more insufferable if you let them. Today, he tried to disrupt our production rules. Tomorrow, he'll demand free production. Can you afford that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie hesitated, at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The only way to deal with bullies like him," Marcus continued, "is to put them in their place. Make them fear you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Walter's background well enough&mdash;he was a distant relative of the Brown family, a prestigious name in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus had already dealt with Leo, one of their key members. A minor connection like Walter didn't faze him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Walter isn't someone to be trifled with. He's tied to the Browns and has deep connections in both Kingston's underworld and high society. I'm worried you might be at a disadvantage," Josie admitted, her concern evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smirked. "He's the one in the wrong. Meddling in legitimate business operations tarnishes the reputation of anyone associated with him. The Brown family won't risk their name for someone like Walter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused before adding, "As for the rest of his network, I'm curious to see what they've got."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's calm and logical analysis eased Josie's nerves slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was right&mdash;the Browns, despite their power, wouldn't jeopardize their standing for Walter's petty vendettas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright," she said reluctantly. "I'll have the security team keep an eye on things to protect you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved her off. "No need. I can handle it myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie didn't respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Still uneasy, Josie stepped out of the office and discreetly made a call. "Allen, I've got trouble at the company. There might be some thugs coming soon. Please get here with reinforcements as quickly as you can."</span></p><div class="pagination">
