  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was full of longing for the Return Essence stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had unknowingly cultivated the Hidden State, which had given him a solid foundation far beyond ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he reached the Return Essence stage, his strength would certainly be much greater than an average person at that stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Grace woke up from her faint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was still flushed, but her eyes had returned to their clear state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Mr. Fitzgerald, I'm so hungry. Let's go out and eat something. I heard there are many delicious things in Kingston."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her first words after waking up were about food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus suddenly thought that she was quite the foodie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He replied, "Okay, let's go eat something good now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had no reason to refuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace suddenly jumped off the bed and into Marcus' arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus caught her, but her round, firm chest pressed directly against his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, he felt his breath become a bit difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before food, you want to invite me to eat your breasts?" he asked with a sly smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace gave him an embarrassed glare and said, "You're so bad. I won't talk to you anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She got out of his arms and ran into the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a quick wash, Grace returned to her pure and charming state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took 20 minutes to apply light makeup and then went out with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, it was already past 8 p.m., the busiest time in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Workers from all over the country had finished work, and restaurants, bars, night markets, bathhouses, and other entertainment venues were starting to fill up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus and Grace stepped out of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A military vehicle sped over and stopped right in front of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several </span><span>Uswad</span><span> soldiers in military uniforms got out of the vehicle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader was a woman, who appeared to be under 30 years old but already had the rank of lieutenant colonel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman was beautiful, about 5'7'' tall, with a curvy and fit figure. In her military uniform, she looked heroic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her large, spirited eyes made her unforgettable after just one glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the </span><span>Uswad</span><span> soldiers got out of the vehicle, they all saluted Marcus in a standard military way, their faces filled with respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman at the front spoke in a clear, powerful voice, "Lydia, staff officer of the 105th Command of the </span><span>Uswad</span><span> military, presents her greetings to Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus narrowed his eyes and returned a not-so-standard military salute. He asked, "What's the matter? Why are you looking for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apart from Oliver and Jareth, the deputy commander of Solace Military Division, Marcus had never really interacted with the </span><span>Uswad</span><span> military.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't know why Lydia was looking for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She replied, "Mr. Fitzgerald, after you became a special advisor to the military, </span><span>Commander Ashford personally set up a Special Advisor Department for you in the </span><span>Uswad</span><span> military. We are here on his orders to work in the Special Advisor Department.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From today on, I am your secretary."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lydia looked Marcus up and down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had heard of Marcus' heroic deeds of rescuing Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In person, he was even more handsome than she had imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made her feel a bit dazzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Special Advisor Department? But didn't we agree I wouldn't need to work for the </span><span>Uswad</span><span> military?" Marcus asked, surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lydia smiled and replied, "Yes, the Special Advisor Department is set up for you, Mr. Fitzgerald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As per the previous agreement, you still won't need to go to the military to work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"On normal days, we will handle your work for you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And if you encounter difficult issues, we can use the military's power to help you solve them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus relaxed upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't care whether the Special Advisor Department was set up, as long as he didn't need to go to the military.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From Lydia's explanation, it seemed that the department was created to make things more convenient for him, without causing any other issues.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wouldn't refuse a department that could be helpful at times, especially when military power could solve many problems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus tentatively asked, "By the way, I'd like to know, what rank do I have as a special advisor, and what rights do I have? Could you explain that to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lydia's eyes sparkled. She hadn't expected that Marcus didn't even know how high his position was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lydia was puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed he didn't care about fame at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought for a moment and then explained to Marcus, "The special advisor position was recently established by the </span><span>Uswad</span><span> military. Although it carries the rank of a major general, the position itself is equivalent to a military region commander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In theory, as long as you're willing, you could command the forces of an entire military region."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had thought that Julian's offer was just a formality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never expected it to be such a powerful position, almost equivalent to a military region commander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People in this position were usually considered military giants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were real big shots. From a rank perspective, Marcus now surpassed Benjamin, Grace's father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace, who had been quietly listening, was also shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never imagined that Marcus' position held such great power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin had worked for years in politics to become the mayor of </span><span>Solomia</span><span>. That was already an impressive achievement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, this position had completely overshadowed Benjamin's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, did we interrupt your travel plans? If so, we can leave now. Please feel free to contact me anytime. As your secretary, I'm available 24/7," Lydia added, remembering this part.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She added Marcus on WhatsApp and exchanged phone numbers with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, she left with those soldiers in military uniforms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, you're amazing!" Grace said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Marcus with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved his hand and said, "It's just an empty title. Nothing to boast about."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then the two of them took a taxi to a famous restaurant in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The restaurant was very popular and well-known online.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many celebrities visited to try the food and take photos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Girls like Grace loved visiting trending spots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had wanted to come here for a long time, and she was thrilled to be here with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when they arrived, the restaurant was packed, and there were no available seats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had to find a place to wait for a table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grace, is that you?" Just then, a familiar voice came from nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace instinctively turned around and saw a man and a woman walking toward the restaurant.</span></p><div class="pagination">
