        <h1>Chapter 40 No Surgery</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked concerned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was soft, like a calming breeze, carrying no trace of malice but pure, genuine concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course," Catherine replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following her lead, Marcus stepped into a ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A frail woman in the middle of her years was lying silently on the bed. Her face was sallow, drained of life. Her body was thin and seemingly lifeless. This was Laura Wilson, Catherine's mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Catherine, who is this young man? Is he your boyfriend?" Laura asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Catherine guided Marcus to the bedside, Laura forced her weakened body to respond. With a tired but gentle smile, she opened her eyes and greeted Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine's cheeks flushed a deep red. "Mom! His name is Marcus Fitzgerald. We're just friends. Ordinary friends."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura's smile faltered, replaced by a look of disappointment. She reached out, holding her daughter's hand. "Catherine, you're not young anymore. It's time you found someone. I want to see you settled before I close my eyes for the last time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Catherine could respond, Marcus took a step forward. "Ma'am, you're not going to die. Your illness can be cured."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura chuckled softly. "You're sweet. But I know my body. These doctors have told me everything. I won't live much longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled up in Catherine's eyes. "Mom, I've already asked Thomas to find the best professor for your surgery. It's going to be okay. I know it will."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they spoke, Marcus activated his X-ray vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes pierced through Laura's fragile flesh, delving deep into her organs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he saw confirmed that Laura was in the advanced stages of liver cancer. The cancer cells had metastasized, spreading to other organs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cancer had spread relentlessly, with the tumor now consuming almost her entire liver. And within this monstrous growth, there was something even more sinister: a bean-sized cancerous embryo. It was the most deadly kind, a ticking time bomb threatening what little time she had left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this situation, the surgery would be extremely risky. Far more dangerous than what the male doctor, Thomas, had led them to believe. The odds of a successful outcome weren't nearly as high as he had claimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even for Marcus, the odds of survival were slim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a harsh reminder of the darker side of the medical world, where hospitals sometimes prioritized profits over patients.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some hospitals, driven by the pursuit of profit, resort to despicable practices. They prescribed medications without a second thought, pushing them onto patients who didn't really need them. They preyed on the vulnerable, convincing those with little to no chance of recovery that surgery was their only hope. And in the darkest corners of these institutions, the reselling of organs happened more often.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas wasn't necessarily a bad man; he could just be a cog in that machine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Laura's condition was undeniably severe, Marcus still had a method to treat her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timeless Warrior's Grimoire contained advanced healing techniques, and combined with the healing elixirs in the Spatial Ring, they could eradicate the cancer cells entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These remedies were beyond the reach of ordinary people, making cancer seem like an incurable disease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Catherine, Mr. Miller has arrived. Help your mom prepare. We need to get her into surgery immediately. The sooner, the better. Every minute we delay decreases the chances of success," Thomas announced, entering the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine nodded as she packed her mother's belongings. "Mom, don't worry. This will all be over soon. You're going to get better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura smiled weakly, her heart swelling with pride at her daughter's devotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No surgery," Marcus interjected, his voice cutting through the tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone froze, staring at him in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas frowned as he looked Marcus up and down. "Catherine, who is this guy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's my friend, Marcus," Catherine explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas sized Marcus up. There was nothing particularly remarkable about Marcus except, perhaps, his striking good looks. With a hint of condescension, Thomas announced, "Mrs. Wilson has only one month left without surgery. And as a doctor, I know more about this than you ever will. Even if you're Catherine's friend, you should really stay out of her business."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine pulled Marcus aside. "Please, don't offend Thomas. He's trying to help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles, the renowned professor of internal medicine in Solomia, had been flown in from abroad. He was a prized catch, someone even powerful figures struggled to book for surgeries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas had pulled every string to get him, and Catherine wasn't about to let this golden opportunity slip through her fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, stood his ground. "The cancer has spread to two-thirds of the liver. It's not just any cancer; it's a rare 'mother-daughter' cancer cell structure. Surgery at this stage is incredibly risky. Without it, she has a month. With it, she might not make it through the night."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas's patience was wearing thin. "What are you even talking about? Do you have any idea who Charles is? Let me tell you, he's one of the best. Under his knife, patients with even the most severe cancers have survived for years, sometimes even fully recovering. If you don't know what you're talking about, keep your opinions to yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine gently tugged at Marcus's arm, giving him a pleading look. "Say less, please," she whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the door swung open, and a team of white-coated figures entered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leading them was a man in his fifties with graying hair and an air of authority. This was Charles Miller.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thomas, I have an academic conference in a few hours. Why hasn't the patient been prepped for surgery yet? If you've decided against it, I need to know now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles wore a mask of frustration. It was clear he was extremely dissatisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine rushed to explain. "No, we're ready. I'm so sorry for the delay. We'll head to the operating room immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles remained cold. "Then what was the holdup?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His gaze shifted to Thomas. "Thomas, you make sure not to bring me cases like this when I return to Solomia. This is a waste of resources."</span></p></div>
