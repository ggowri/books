And as soon as Marcus showed his head, he would be shot to death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus turned the muzzle of his gun directly to that direction and completed the shooting in just one second!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His reaction speed could not be matched even by the world's most powerful sniper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bullet broke through everything and shot the sniper's forehead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without the threat of the sniper, Marcus rolled out of the wooden house, used a coconut tree as a cover, and shot at another firing point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, a more powerful submachine gun was used, and several enemies were instantly killed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus shot and moved forward at the same time. He was unstoppable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The alarms were getting more urgent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a two-story wooden house in the Red River Mines, several middle-aged men were alarmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judging from their clothes, they should be high-ranking officials here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially the tall middle-aged man in the lead was a powerful Ancient Martial Art expert at the Stage One!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His skin was dark, and his body was full of muscles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition to his cultivation, he had a ferocious beast tied to his side with an iron chain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ferocious beast looked like a tiger and like a lion. It seemed like a hybrid of the two creatures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was fundamentally different from the ligers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, the ferocious beast released spiritual power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a spiritual beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, this middle-aged man, in addition to possessing the skills of a warrior, was also a legendary </span><span>beastmaster</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, the mine seems to have been attacked. There are so many gunshots outside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man at the head was angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This person must be crazy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he said this, he led the beast out of the cabin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a distance, he saw Marcus slaughtering those armed killers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man waved at the killers, signaling them to stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the gunshots and alarms all stopped, and the space returned to peace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boy, we have no grudge against you. Why are you making such a fuss? If we have offended you, I will apologize to you. How about we end this fight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, the middle-aged man saw through Marcus' identity as a warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he could not see through Marcus' specific cultivation level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was scary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant Marcus had a higher revision than the middle-aged man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, the middle-aged man was unsure and had to ask for peace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at the man and sneered, "I have no grudge against you, but your men invited me here. And what you did was shameful, so I won't stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man looked unhappy and asked tentatively, "What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sneered, "Give the order to release all the slaves that were trafficked here, and dissolve the Red River Mines. Otherwise, you and everyone around you will die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had a domineering attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I cannot agree to your request!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the middle-aged man could not accept it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Red River Mines was the result of his years of hard work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it was also the foundation of his cultivation. This industry had provided him with the cultivation to this state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he did what Marcus said, he would not be able to continue practicing Ancient Martial Art.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In that case, just don't regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please don't go too far. I have some abilities."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man's eyes became sharper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason why he asked for peace was not entirely because he was afraid of Marcus, but because he did not want to suffer losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Marcus was showing no mercy, the man had no choice but to give it a try!</span></p><div class="pagination">
