  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop talking nonsense! I don't believe you don't have any money. You're just pretending to be poor. You don't want to give me any!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man didn't believe Chloe's words at all and continued, "I need one hundred thousand dollars right now. Give it to me quickly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then reached out his hand as if it was his right to demand it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe frowned and said, "I really don't have any money left. You're asking for one hundred thousand dollars, where do you think I'm going to get that from?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, if you needed the money for something serious, I would definitely sell everything I have to give you that one hundred thousand dollars. But what do you need it for? You know it better than anyone. So no, I'm not giving you any more money!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Last time, that half a million dollars was the last time I helped you out. You should know your place!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Chloe's words, the man immediately became furious. He grabbed her collar with a violent jerk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body trembled, his eyes wide open, full of rage, looking like he had lost his sanity. Through clenched teeth, he growled, "You're not giving me money, huh? Say that again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe repeated what she had said earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's emotions instantly exploded, and he spat out, "Not giving me money, huh? Let's see if you can get away with this. You're not giving me money? I'll kill you right here if you don't!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he grabbed Chloe's throat and shook her forcefully, looking as though he meant to strangle her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more he trembled, the more vicious his face became.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe immediately started coughing violently, her pale face turning red. Her eyes were filled with sorrow and despair as tears rolled down her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the man's actions became more and more violent, Marcus could no longer stand by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed the man's wrist with great force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man let out a painful scream and immediately released his grip on Chloe's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus shook the man off with a look of disdain, sending him crashing to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus walked over to Chloe and gently patted her back to help her catch her breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe coughed a few more times, then shook her head at Marcus. "I'm fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the man who had fallen to the ground stood up. He glared at Marcus, his eyes full of fury. "So, Chloe, now you're finding random men to protect you? You let him beat up your own brother? What kind of person are you? After everything we've been through, is this how you repay the blood ties we share? Can you face the souls of our parents in heaven with a clear conscience?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've really grown up and gotten cocky. It's just one hundred thousand dollars. I heard through the grapevine that your appearance fee is now five million dollars. You can't even spare one hundred thousand dollars for me? I never expected you to be so stingy. And to have some man come beat me up... I'm truly disappointed in you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the man's words, Chloe could no longer hold back the tears that had been building up inside. She broke down and sobbed uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cries were heart-wrenching, as if they carried all the pain and injustice she had endured over the years. "You're my only family left. After our parents passed away, you're all I have. How could I be stingy with you? Every time you asked for money, when have I ever refused? No matter how hard I worked or how much I suffered, I always found a way to give you money.</span></p><div class="pagination">
