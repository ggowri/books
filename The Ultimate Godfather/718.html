  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie rubbed her eyes vigorously, fearing that she was seeing things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, no matter how much she rubbed, that astonishing string of numbers remained right there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is an 11-digit number. How much is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie was in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes fell on the balance, and she started counting digit by digit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, millions, billions...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"T-This is 20 billion dollars. Marcus, you actually transferred 20 billion dollars to me?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie's eyes were brimming with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had previously guessed that Marcus might take out more than 20 million dollars to intimidate Atlas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she was certain that the sum wouldn't be significantly more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe it could be 40 or 50 million dollars, yet at most, it wouldn't go beyond 100 million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to Natalie's astonishment, Marcus directly transferred 20 billion dollars to her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Working at a leading luxury jewelry customization store, she often encountered large quantities of cash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nevertheless, she had never dealt with such a large amount of money before!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was 20 billion dollars!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Undoubtedly, this was no small sum, neither for the average person nor for the super-rich!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus casually transferred the money to her using his iPhone X, a device that had been on the market for seven years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a shock!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Naturally, Payne and the others heard Natalie's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all arched their brows and didn't attach any significance to what she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edwin subconsciously approached her and caught a glimpse of the long string of numbers on her phone screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he fixed his eyes on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"T-This is really 20 billion dollars. It really is 20 billion dollars!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This guy actually has such a vast amount of money. He directly transferred 20 billion dollars to Natalie!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, Mom, our family has come into a fortune. There's no way we could use up 20 billion dollars over the course of several lifetimes!" Edwin shouted excitedly, almost jumping up from the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It even seemed like a dream!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Payne, Mia, Cora, and Atlas couldn't help but widen their eyes in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cora took Natalie's phone from her and examined it carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, she trembled violently as if struck by lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Atlas naturally saw the startling string of numbers on Natalie's phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A profound expression of disbelief surfaced on his face. He couldn't help but ask Marcus, "It's impossible. It's absolutely impossible. How on earth do you have such a colossal amount of money? Tell me, where did you obtain all this money?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From Atlas' perspective, Marcus didn't seem like a wealthy person anyway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he had just checked and discovered that Marcus was not the legal representative of the Golden Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This indicates that Marcus had been lying previously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was inconceivable that a liar like him could so easily fork out 20 billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are in no position to know my identity," Marcus said with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, he glanced at the Vance family and said, "According to your previous requirements, I have paid more money. Am I qualified to be Natalie's husband?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Payne immediately nodded mechanically. "Yes, of course. You can be Natalie's husband!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edwin dared not say anything more. How could he possibly risk offending someone who could casually give away 20 billion dollars as a gift?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cora's face darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this blind date failed, all the benefits Atlas had provided for her would vanish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mia experienced a twinge of guilt. After all, she had wrongly assumed before that Marcus was penniless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at the very moment when everyone was astounded by Marcus' 20-billion-dollar transfer, Atlas mocked, "It's merely 20 billion dollars. Don't get overly arrogant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Payne, Edwin, Cora, and Mia all looked at him intently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be possible that Atlas could produce an amount exceeding 20 billion dollars?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cora said, "Atlas, I'm aware that you're quite fond of Natalie. However, I previously heard from your mother that the combined annual earnings from your gas stations and your salary amount to merely around 30 to 40 million dollars. Since you've only been operating the gas stations for two years, the amount of ready cash you possess shouldn't exceed 100 million dollars. So, how on earth could you possibly come up with over 20 billion dollars?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Atlas smiled, "I don't have that much money right now, but don't forget that I'm Mr. Olson's subordinate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bayside Petroleum Company has recently discovered an underwater oil field boasting extremely high reserves in the waters adjacent to </span><span>Solomia</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Olson and I have been in charge of this matter. Based on the latest developments, this underwater oil field will commence official production in less than three months.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Given Mr. Olson's capabilities, this oil field is expected to yield over 100 billion dollars in profits for him in the first year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As his right-hand man, I can get at least 30% of the profits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In other words, I will have at least 30 billion dollars in funds deposited into my account in three months."</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
