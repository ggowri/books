  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at the Department of Justice officers and said calmly, "Here's a recording. It's proof of Adam Parker accepting ten million dollars in cash from Golden Group not long ago. If you need the transaction details, I can provide those as well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officers' eyes lit up. "If you have evidence, Mr. Fitzgerald, that makes our job much easier. Ten million is a massive amount&mdash;Adam could face at least twenty years, no matter how powerful he thinks he is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Joseph, George, and Nora all visibly tensed. Their faces grew pale, and their nerves were on edge. "Mr. Fitzgerald, is there anything else you'd like us to handle?" one of the officers asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' sharp gaze swept over Joseph and others. "Do these people fall under your jurisdiction?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officer nodded. "All public officials in this city are under our purview. You're welcome to report any misconduct to us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good," Marcus replied. He pointed at Nora. "This woman abuses her power to rearrange students' seats as she pleases and takes bribes from parents. As for Captain Joseph, he tried to arrest people without proper investigation and has financial ties to Adam and his wife. This school's principal, George, has been involved in shady financial dealings with Adam during the construction of the new teaching building. You should look into all of them thoroughly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The color drained from the faces of all four individuals. Nora broke down immediately. "I've never taken money from anyone. That's slander." She shot a warning glance at the parents in the room, silently threatening them to stay quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as her words fell, a parent stood up, visibly outraged. "I can testify to what Mr. Fitzgerald said. When my child transferred here recently, all the paperwork was in order, but she refused to sign off until I gave her five thousand dollars. Only then did she allow my son to join the class."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another parent stood up. "Me too. My son was being bullied in class, and when I asked Nora to intervene, she turned a blind eye until I gifted her a set of luxury cosmetics worth three thousand and eight hundred dollars. Only then did she do something about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Me too..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More parents began standing up, one after another, openly accusing Nora of taking bribes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Department of Justice officer didn't hesitate. "Arrest her." With a wave of his hand, officers stepped forward and restrained Nora, whose face had completely collapsed into despair. She never imagined things would come to this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regret surged through her&mdash;regret for being so arrogant, regret for siding with Madeline just because of her connections. If she had simply acted fairly from the start, she wouldn't have provoked Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with so many complaints against her, not only would Nora lose her job, but if the charges were severe enough, she might even face jail time. The realization was too much for Nora, and she looked as though she might collapse entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Joseph, George, and the academic director were drenched in cold sweat, their fear palpable. Within minutes, the Department of Justice received a call from </span><span>their headquarters. The investigation had uncovered severe violations by all three men. Joseph, George, and the academic director had been taking bribes, embezzling funds, and engaging in misconduct for years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't stop there&mdash;George and the academic director were found to be involved in abuse of power for sexual favors. Several newly hired female teachers had been coerced, and though they had suffered in silence for years, they finally found the courage to step forward and accuse the two men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With irrefutable evidence piling up, Joseph, George, and the academic director had no hope left. They were arrested on the spot and handed over to the prosecutor's office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, thank you so much," one of the Department of Justice officers said to Marcus gratefully. "Without your help, we wouldn't have been able to catch them at once."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved dismissively. There were countless corrupt officials out there&mdash;far too many for him to deal with alone. This wasn't something he usually concerned himself with. But today, Nicole had been mistreated at school, and he couldn't stand by without seeking justice for her.</span></p><div class="pagination">
