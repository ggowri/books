  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're lying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Dylan could finish his word, Marcus interrupted him, "From what I know, Allan has been diligent since joining, and he has managed Builder Market very efficiently. He is fully qualified for the position of general manager.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The reason you agreed to Aaron firing Allan is because he offered you his daughter, isn't that right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan was trembling with nervousness, and his face turned pale hearing Marcus' words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr... Mr. Fitzgerald, I'm innocent! It's a baseless accusation. I didn't do anything wrong, and this is all a misunderstanding!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' expression became serious. "If you keep lying, do you believe I can make sure you can't work in Solomia anymore?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One sentence and Dylan almost fainted in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although it was Dylan's first time meeting Marcus, he had already heard about this young man's story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two months ago, Marcus took over Golden Group and immediately swept away the two senior figures of the group, causing their mysterious deaths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He then directly seized their shares and became the sole master of Golden Group!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Michelle was nothing but a puppet to this young man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, when facing Marcus, Dylan was far more cautious and respectful than when dealing with Michelle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Marcus said he could make Dylan's life in Solomia impossible, Dylan didn't dare doubt him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was because Marcus had that kind of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Dylan didn't dare hide anything from Marcus and admitted to the fact that he had been keeping Aaron's daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He even bowed before Marcus, pleading for forgiveness in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This scene completely stunned Allan and Lisa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They always thought of the billion-dollar tycoon Dylan as a figure far above them, but now here he was, bowing and apologizing before Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It completely turned their understanding upside down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dylan. How dare you! You, a chairman who's only been in office for three years, are already engaging in quid pro quo harassment. Tell me, besides this, what other things have you done that harm the interests of the group? Be honest and confess!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' voice was loud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It made Dylan tremble and nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I swear, Mr. Fitzgerald, there's nothing else! I'm just a little lecherous, and I haven't done anything else that harms the group's interests. Please, Mr. Fitzgerald, forgive me this time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan said in a pitiful voice, utterly devoid of the powerful image he once had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well then, I'll give you one chance. You know what you need to do, right?" Marcus said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan, as if granted a reprieve, quickly bowed repeatedly in thanks to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan then dialed Aaron's number. "Aaron Dawson, you're fired. Come to me tomorrow to settle your salary!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Aaron could respond, Dylan hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's because of that damn guy that I almost offended Mr. Fitzgerald! I won't show mercy to someone like him. Firing Aaron is nothing more than losing a woman, but I can still keep my position as chairman. I can get all kinds of women, but the position of chairman is something I can't just get!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dylan knew this well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He then looked at Allan and smiled. "Allan, starting today, you're the new general manager of Builder Market. Your annual salary will be increased from one million to three million!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Both Allan and Lisa were utterly stunned upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They could hardly believe Dylan's words!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I was just about to be fired, but now, because of one word from Marcus, everything has turned around. I've even landed the dream position of general manager! And my salary has even tripled! It is unbelievable!" Allan thought to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Dixon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Allan didn't know what to say. The happiness came so suddenly that he was at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You should thank Mr. Fitzgerald, not me." Dylan quickly said. He didn't want to be blamed by Mr. Fitzgerald for Allan thanking the wrong person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Allan realized his mistake and hurriedly bowed to Marcus to thank him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lisa, also ecstatic, said to Marcus, "Marcus, I'm so grateful! I don't even know what to say, and I owe you a huge thanks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps overwhelmed by her excitement, Lisa tried to bow in front of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus stopped her, saying, "Lisa, we're all family. You don't need to be like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you and Allan are doing well, you can take better care of Nick, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lisa nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Allan didn't know what to say either, and his heart was racing.</span></p><div class="pagination">
