  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After integrating the amulet and practicing diligently for several days, Marcus discovered that his mastery of the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire had reached the primordial ascension stage of Stage One. He was now tantalizingly close to breaking through to the Stage Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was eager to advance to Stage Two swiftly, yet there appeared to be an intangible barrier between the realms. It was just a whisper away, yet it felt like an invisible force was thwarting him, preventing that final step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems that even when I reach the primordial ascension stage of Stage One, advancing to the Stage Two is no easy feat," Marcus thought to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Timeless Warrior's Grimoire mentioned the existence of magical medicines and herbs that could aid in cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These could either be used to refine pills or consumed directly to enhance one's abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus </span><span>knew</span><span> he might need such aids to break through to the next level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this thought in mind, he decided to stop practicing for the day and get some much-needed rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was drifting into sleep, he felt something smooth and soft crawl into the quilt with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Startled, he opened his eyes to find Natalia's delicate face. Her large, bright eyes gazed intently at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Natalia, why are you here? Why aren't you asleep at this hour?" Marcus asked</span><span> with </span><span>surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia playfully flicked his nose and teased, "We only got halfway through what we started </span><span>last time</span><span>. You wouldn't want to leave things hanging, would you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus understood her implication immediately. However, he had just spent hours having sex with Jane and then practiced the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, leaving him genuinely exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm </span><span>too tired</span><span> and want to rest. How about another day?" he suggested, hoping she would </span><span>give up</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia frowned, clearly unimpressed. "Why didn't you feel tired when we were in the rental house? And you said nothing happened with Jane?" she countered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus felt helpless, realizing he had underestimated her sharpness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't care. I just want you! I love you!" she declared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without further ado, Natalia slipped completely under the covers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, Marcus felt himself enveloped by her warmth, the familiar slickness rekindling his desires.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Memories of their sex in the rental house surged back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus felt his vigor restored. With a swift motion, he pinned Natalia beneath him and banged her without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia moaned softly, a mixture of pain and pleasure crossing her features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the Winchester Villa, it was her first time to have sex, and her nerves prevented her from fully indulging in the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span>, when his dick entered her body, she experienced a sharp pang of pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The initial discomfort quickly gave way to an overwhelming sensation of pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, you are so naughty. I just wanted to tease you. Why did you take it so seriously?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, you're great. Harder. Faster."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia moaned, her body responding eagerly to his every move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was undeniable that Natalia had a natural allure; she could be icy and distant one moment, but she could transform into a fiery temptress in bed. She knew exactly how to turn Marcus on, prompting him to conquer her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was devoted to pleasing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their passionate cries echoed through the room, the door having been left slightly ajar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana, still working, could hear the sounds clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she had never experienced such intimacy, she instantly recognized the origin of the sounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald just doesn't know when to hold back. If he keeps this up, his body's gonna give out sooner or later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana mused to herself. She believed she was unaffected by the sounds, yet her body was betraying her. A strange heat crept over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, Marcus woke to find Natalia gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked out to </span><span>see</span><span> Diana preparing a delicious breakfast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia soon joined them, pretending as if nothing had </span><span>happen</span><span>ed the night before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Marcus was about to sit down for breakfast, his phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, if you don't want your adoptive parents to die, go to the abandoned factory in the east of the city within an hour!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold, menacing voice echoed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Marcus could respond, the caller hung up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A frown creased his brow, and murderous intent surged out from him like an invisible wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood up abruptly. "</span><span>Take your time</span><span>. I'm going out for a while," Marcus declared, his tone leaving no room for argument.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he turned to leave, Diana spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, how about I come with you?" She looked worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said, "No, just focus on your work. I can handle this myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her worry, Diana respected his decision. She handed him her submachine gun and several extra magazines</span><span> for protection</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus accepted the gun without a moment's hesitation, securing it to his waist. Without another word, he slid into his Ferrari as he sped off toward the abandoned factory.</span></p><div class="pagination">
