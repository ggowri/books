"I've been in the trenches with blood disorders for over a decade, and I've never come across this guy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's just see what he does," Jenny replied as she stared at Marcus, a disdainful smirk playing on her lips. "If it's all a scam, we can help Mayor Benjamin call the cops."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given Grace's condition, even God would be hard-pressed to save her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenny was itching to see this so-called miracle doctor's magic trick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, you're about to start the treatment," Benjamin said. "Should we step out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved his hand dismissively. "Your daughter's condition is serious, but her organs aren't damaged. The treatment will be quick."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin's eyes widened, a flicker of hope igniting in them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two doctors standing nearby rolled their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "This guy's just spouting nonsense." Grace's leukemia was one of the worst cases they had ever laid eyes on. Even their chief of staff had shaken his head in defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus made it sound like a walk in the park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, they were convinced that Marcus was a fraud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus ignored their skeptical looks. He pulled a pill from his Spatial Ring and gave it to Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd gotten it when he took down Ricardo, and it had a powerful healing effect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within seconds, the pill dissolved, the powerful medicine coursing through Grace's </span><span>veins to relentlessly attack the cancer cells.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simultaneously, Marcus practiced the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire. Wisps of Numinous Energy flowed from his fingertips into Grace's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Numinous Energy melded seamlessly with the medicinal power, doubling the healing effect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before their very eyes, Grace's face began to regain its color. It was like watching a flower bloom in fast-forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than ten minutes, her heartbeat returned to normal, and her breathing grew stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the line on the monitor began to smooth out, gradually returning to a normal rhythm, the two doctors stood frozen, their eyes widening in sheer astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was unbelievable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They blinked, suspecting they were caught in some sort of hallucination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just moments ago, the dean issued a critical notice for this severe leukemia patient," Hugh whispered. "And now, with nothing but the deft maneuvers of this young man, she's recovered in a way that defies all logic. It's simply unbelievable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Grace's</span><span> healed! She's healed! Lilian, come in. Our daughter is healed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin's eyes sparkled with an electric excitement, tears brimming as he turned towards the door and shouted with all his might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Convinced that there was no hope to be had from Marcus, Lilian had resigned herself to waiting in the corridor, choosing not to enter the intensive care unit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, upon hearing Benjamin's joyous shout, she wondered if her ears were deceiving her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lilian, did you hear that?" Benjamin yelled again. "</span><span>Grace's</span><span> alive! What are you waiting for? Come in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Benjamin's voice rang out a second time, the certainty in his tone washed over Lilian, convincing her that what she heard was no illusion but a reality she had scarcely dared to hope for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She dashed into the intensive care unit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing Grace, whose cheeks now glowed with a healthy rosy hue on the hospital bed, Lilian froze, utterly petrified in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Grace's</span><span> really healed! I'm not dreaming..." she whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes widened with incredulity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since the day Grace was diagnosed with leukemia, Lilian had been enveloped in an endless shroud of grief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Night after night, sleep eluded her. She had been wrestling with relentless pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless times, she had allowed herself to dream of her daughter's recovery, only to be dragged back to the harshness of reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, when the announcement of Grace's imminent death felt like the sky itself had collapsed upon Lilian, who was engulfed by despair so deep that she felt stripped of any reason to go on living.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as she teetered on the brink of utter despair, her daughter, against all odds, had suddenly gotten better!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To assure herself that the scene before her was no cruel mirage, Lilian pinched herself hard, several times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt the sharp sting of pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It hurt like hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was tangible proof that this moment was indeed real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Benjamin, Grace's really better," Lilian said. "It must be Dr. Williamson who saved her, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reflexively, she dismissed Marcus, and the first person she credited with this turn of events was Hugh, Grace's attending physician.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lilian, you're wrong!" Benjamin reminded. "It was Mr. Fitzgerald who saved Grace. If it wasn't for him, she'd be gone. He's our family's savior!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Lilian was left in a state of stunned silence, her mind struggling to process the information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Mr. Fitzgerald is actually saving my daughter!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The kid in his early twenties?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I spent the whole time questioning him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he saved my daughter!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing her oversight, Lilian felt her cheeks flush with embarrassment and turned to Marcus with a rush of gratitude. "Thank you, Mr. Fitzgerald, for saving my daughter. I was so blind before. Please, don't hold it against me. I owe you everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she made a move to kneel before him in profound thanks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus quickly stepped forward to gently support Lilian. With an easygoing wave of his hand, he dismissed her gratitude. "No big deal. Mrs. Mitchell, please don't mention it. Give this pill to your daughter at this time tomorrow. It will ensure her condition is fully healed."</span></p><div class="pagination">
