        <h1>Chapter 300 We Are Family</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus, how is Nick?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Richard asked with a worried expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've cleared the blocked blood vessels. Nick should be fine now," Marcus replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He just finished. Richard, Melinda, Aria, Lisa, and Allan were all frozen in place, their expressions showing disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus, you've only been in the ward for 10 minutes, and Nick's illness is already cured? Are you kidding me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Richard asked, hardly believing Marcus' words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, Marcus, this is a life-and-death matter. You can't joke about something like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melinda also reminded him of that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She worried that Marcus, afraid that Nick's family would look down on him, might be lying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You can go in and see for yourselves. Nick should be awake by now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The group exchanged glances and hurried into the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Marcus had said, Nick had indeed woken up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His complexion was rosy, and his breathing was perfectly steady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick surprisingly sat up in bed and tried to get out of it while seeing his family enter the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dad, you're awake!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lisa rushed over to stop him, afraid that Nick might relapse if he wasn't careful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Lisa, I'm fine now. Don't stop me. I feel no dizziness no shortness of breath. I'm full of energy now. Let me take a walk!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick said, getting out of bed and walking around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His posture was upright, his breathing strong and steady, and he no longer looked frail like before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aria, Lisa, Allan, and the others were all stunned by seeing this, their eyes filled with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They all knew Nick's condition well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even when his life wasn't in danger,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick could barely walk a few steps without panting, let alone move around like he was now, full of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The way Nick looked now seemed no different from someone who hadn't been sick at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Lisa, go ask Allan which doctor he got for me. I need to thank him properly. It feels like my illness is completely gone. I feel so much younger than before!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick said to Lisa with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick's symptoms had improved, and he was overjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was even thinking about writing a thank-you letter to the doctor who treated him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Nick, it wasn't the doctor. It was Marcus who saved you. If you want to thank someone, thank Marcus!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lisa said, tears welling up in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick froze at her words. "Marcus? Really, Marcus?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aria nodded. "Yes, it was Marcus who saved you. The hospital had already declared you dead earlier. If it weren't for Marcus, we'd be planning your funeral right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick immediately walked over to Marcus after hearing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His expression was filled with emotion, and he said, "Marcus, thank you so much! You're my lifesaver!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I can't believe I didn't believe in you before. I was so wrong!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick tried to bow to Marcus after saying this, but Marcus stopped him. "Nick, don't say that. I'm your nephew. I must help you. We're family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Although we had some misunderstandings before, I can tell that Nick's family is generally good people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They might be a bit narrow-minded, but they aren't bad at heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They are completely different from my aunt, Alice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her family is both cruel and snobbish, and they don't want their relatives to have a better life than they do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They even insulted Melinda in public, which is why I stepped in to teach them a lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But a relative like Nick, I'm more than happy to help," Marcus thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus, I've said some harsh things to you before. I hope you don't take it to heart. I owe you an apology."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lisa walked over, and she looked regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking back on the things she said to Marcus, Lisa felt deeply guilty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even though Marcus might be a bit of a show-off as a son-in-law, he really is a good person. Despite everything I said, he still saved my dad," she thought, filled with gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Lisa, I already told Nick that we're family. There's no need to be sorry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Lisa isn't a bad person. She just didn't believe I could save Nick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But those are not important." Marcus didn't take it personally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's right. Marcus is right. We're family. Nick, Aria, Lisa, don't be so formal with Marcus anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Richard spoke up at this point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Allan, do we have any good, available stalls at the wholesale market? I want to rent one for Marcus. He's married a rich lady, and while his life might be more comfortable, he'll definitely face some hardships. I want him to stand on his own feet so no one will look down on him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Lisa suddenly spoke up.</span></p></div>
