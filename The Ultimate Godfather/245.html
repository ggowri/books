  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nora, the homeroom teacher, let out a cold laugh. "Your sister is nearsighted? Well, so is this student. Why shouldn't they swap seats?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madeline, the middle-aged woman, chimed in with a smug expression. "The teacher's absolutely right. My son can't see the board from the back row, so of course he needs </span><span>to sit in the front. Go ahead, complain to whoever you want!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was feeling confident&mdash;after all, she'd already greased the wheels with a generous gift to the teacher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' gaze turned colder. "He's a parent, and so am I. If he can request a seat change for his child, then I have every right to demand the same. And now, I'm asking you to move my sister to the front row."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other parents watched the escalating confrontation with growing interest, though most held their silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their eyes, Marcus was doing something foolish. They'd seen parents like him every year&mdash;bold, outspoken, and unafraid to confront authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, the end result was always the same: the child would be isolated, targeted by teachers, and eventually forced to transfer schools.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought Marcus' defiance, while satisfying to watch, was ultimately sealing Nicole's fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nora crossed her arms, a look of disdain on her face. "And just who do you think you are? What gives you the right to boss me around? The seating arrangements have been finalized, and they won't change for the rest of the semester. If you don't like it, go ahead and take it up with the school administration!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madeline smirked and added, "Exactly. And let me tell you something&mdash;my husband is Adam Parker, the Director of Solomia's Department of Construction. The connections we have are beyond your imagination. A simple seat change is nothing. Honestly, if my son wanted to sit on your sister's shoulders, you'd still have to grin and bear it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her hands on her hips and her nose in the air, Madeline looked at Marcus with open disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her, he was nothing more than a lowly nobody from the countryside, making a fuss to feel important.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow. "Your husband's name is Adam Parker, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madeline puffed out her chest, her pride practically spilling over. "That's right! Solomia's entire construction sector runs through him. Even this school's new teaching building got his approval. So, my son sitting in the front? Untouchable. Even if you drag the principal here, the answer's the same!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sneered. "Face it, you're just a nobody. You should know your place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, something clicked for Marcus. Madeline's gaudy appearance and arrogant demeanor finally made sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd had indirect dealings with Adam Parker before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus was setting up a pharmaceutical company, Adam had refused to approve a critical document until he received a hefty bribe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle had eventually sent Adam a 10 million "gift" to push things through, a move she'd later ranted about to Marcus, calling Adam greedy and shameless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' lips curled into a faint smile. "With all that flash you're wearing, your husband must be making good money, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madeline held her head high. "Of course! A lot more than you could ever dream of. My husband approves just one project, and..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She trailed off, catching herself just in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And how much is that, exactly? Go ahead, tell us," Marcus prodded, his tone deceptively casual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madeline scowled. "That's none of your business. Worry about your own life. One thing's for sure&mdash;my son's seat isn't up for discussion. If your sister is stuck in the back, that's on you, not me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' </span><span>smile</span><span> deepened. "Let me guess&mdash;your husband just pocketed 10 million from Golden Group not too long ago, right? No wonder you're decked out in designer brands. Life must be pretty good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell into a stunned silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every parent turned to stare at Madeline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a single project.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The murmurs started immediately, whispering about how insatiable Adam's greed must be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madeline's face twisted in shock and anger. How does this guy know about that? she thought, panic flashing in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly regained her composure and snapped, "I don't know where you're getting these baseless rumors, but you'd better stop slandering us, or I'll sue you for defamation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't even blink. "Oh, you're denying it? Fine. Just wait a moment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled out his phone and dialed a number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few seconds later, a notification from WhatsApp popped up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus tapped on the message and played the audio file for everyone to hear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The recording was unmistakable: Michelle and Adam, discussing the 10 million </span><span>bribe</span><span> in detail.</span></p><div class="pagination">
