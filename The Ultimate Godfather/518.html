  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden rush of emotions made Melina almost lose control, and the intensity of her feelings soared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She reached out to touch Marcus, her hand lingering on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This only intensified Marcus' own feelings, and he felt an overwhelming desire to be closer to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking around at their surroundings, Melina quickly stopped him, saying, "Marcus, this isn't the right place. Let me take you to my room."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus paused, nodding in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took his hand and hurriedly led him through the back door of the villa, pressing the button for the nearby elevator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that this elevator was typically used by the staff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they entered, they coincidentally shared the ride with a middle-aged cleaning lady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sarah..." Melina greeted the woman awkwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Thurman, this elevator is for our servants only. Why are you taking this elevator? Don't get your clothes dirty," Sarah said with a smile. She glanced at Marcus and seemed to have figured something out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't say anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, she picked up the intercom and instructed the other staff, "Ms. Thurman needs to rest. No one is allowed to disturb her in her room."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood," the immediate response came.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina's face turned even redder as she realized what the woman had done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that Sarah was clearly trying to give her and Marcus some privacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have to admit, your staff really knows how to be considerate," Marcus said as they exited the elevator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, stop it! You're embarrassing me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina's face flushed, and she shot him an exasperated look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the young miss of the Thurman family, Melina's room was nothing short of luxurious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was over one hundred square meters in size, with furnishings that had a youthful and elegant feel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A refreshing fragrance filled the air, adding to the room's charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the door closed, Marcus stepped closer and kissed Melina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She found herself gently pressed against the door, her pulse quickening in response to the sudden closeness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus began to become restless. One hand caressed Melina's soft waist while the other began to unbutton her clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The movement revealed the light pink bra and the snow-white and attractive skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lowered his head and kissed Melina's white neck, then to her collarbone, and then to her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the light pink bra was pulled off, revealing a pair of huge breasts with extremely white skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus held her breasts with both hands and began to kiss them with the tip of his tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, that long-lost feeling of pleasure surged back, causing her to let out alluring gasps uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As her body trembled, endless desire came over her again, causing the fragrance on her body to diffuse and enter Marcus' nostrils.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made his desire rise instantly, and he lifted one of her beautiful legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus quickly took off his clothes. Their breaths mingled in the quiet space between them, each one a soft whisper of vulnerability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could feel his warmth, the way his hand gently cupped her face, his thumb tracing the curve of her jaw with a tenderness that made her heart race. There was no rush, no urgency, only the steady, calming rhythm of their closeness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus... you are so bad. You have already done this before we even got into bed... but I like it so much..." Melina said while panting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze toward Marcus was filled with deep affection, brimming with endless desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus kissed her snow-white body while moving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This way might be able to touch the undeveloped sensitive areas of her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it made her sound even more enchanting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She kept twisting her waist and holding Marcus' shoulders with both hands as if she was very eager for Marcus to touch that sensitive part.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus kept moving. His body was sensitive so that he could clearly feel the contraction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each touch, each kiss, was a silent promise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed Melina's hips, spread her legs apart completely, and continued to move. This wasn't just about the body but about something far more profound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina felt an unprecedented sense of happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially after Marcus' Dual Cultivation power was released, their sense of comfort instantly doubled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina experienced an unprecedented feeling of walking on the clouds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cried out, the comfort spread throughout her body, and her body kept twitching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus... I can't take it... You're so strong... you make me feel so happy... I want you to do it harder..." Melina moaned and cried out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since her grandfather fell ill, she hadn't smiled a single day, but today, she finally let go completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus dragged her hips, put Melina on the bed, spread her slim legs, and kissed her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once on the bed, Marcus was able to exert all his strength and began to move more vigorously!</span></p><div class="pagination">
