  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter immediately clamped his mouth shut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, his family had a big business in Kingston, but their market value was only around 100 billion dollars, about the same as the Rising Group run by Troy's father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were nowhere near the league of someone who could drop 350 billion like it was pocket change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Burnett, once I get in good with Mr. Fitzgerald, I'll introduce you," Troy said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harvey nodded eagerly. "Of course, no problem. I'd love to meet the legendary Death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being a member of the Burnett family, he was just a side branch, nowhere near the inner circle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His father managed an industry under the Burnett family umbrella, worth only a few hundred billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, Harvey carried the Burnett blood in his veins, but his family stood shoulder to shoulder with those of Troy and Peter. This parity was the glue that bonded them as the best of friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled and asked casually, "Is your father's name Lester Stevens?" he asked casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lester was the president of Rising </span><span>Group,</span><span> the very man Marcus had promoted himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Troy gaped at Marcus in surprise. "Yeah, how do you know my father's name?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When it came to his father, Troy's face lit up with pride. His father was the backbone of their family, a totem in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've heard of him," Marcus chuckled and nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even though you're in Solomia, my father's a big name in the emerging industries in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>. So, it's not surprising you've heard of him," Troy said with his chest puffed out with pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter, ever the skeptic, reminded, "Troy, don't fall for his act. I've seen guys like him before. They drop impressive names to make themselves look important, but they're usually nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Troy chuckled, finally understanding Peter's point. He turned to Marcus and declared, "While you might not be as bad as Peter says, I'd still advise you not to drop my father's name in other circles. Our family doesn't know you from Adam."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a blatant insult, a public slap in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the midst of the crowded room, Troy didn't spare Marcus an ounce of dignity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia's face clouded with annoyance as she retorted, "Marcus has got plenty of his own clout, okay? He doesn't need to ride on your dad's coattails to make a statement. And let me give you a heads-up, you better not put him down again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Troy ignored Natalia, shaking his head and muttering to himself, "What can some country bumpkin from Solomia possibly do? I'm not going to waste my time on this with you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Harvey's lead, everyone piled into several luxury SUVs, heading towards Harvey's private villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Burnett's private villa is in the most upscale area of Kingston's eastern district," Melina said to Natalia. "It's worth over 100 million dollars, super luxurious. It'll be an eye-opener for Marcus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though her family was upper-class, they weren't rich enough to buy her a 100-million-dollar villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dozen or so girls were buzzing with excitement at the prospect of seeing Harvey's place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some were already talking about the pictures they were going to post on Facebook.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia frowned and whispered, "Marcus, how much is our Bayside Villa worth?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied casually, "That house was given to me. I don't know the exact value, but it should be worth hundreds of millions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the whisper being barely audible, it somehow carried through the air, clear enough for every ear to catch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several girls covered their mouths, trying to stifle their laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "An unemployed bum from Solomia getting a villa worth hundreds of millions? How ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina couldn't help but chuckle, "Natalia, I didn't know Marcus was so funny. No wonder you like him so much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harvey, lounging in his seat, crossed his legs and sneered, "Having dreams is wonderful and all, but once they drift off into fantasy land, well, that's terrible. You know, it's better to stay grounded than to chase the clouds with your head in the sky!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia gritted her teeth, her fists clenching at her sides. She was furious at the way her friends and Harvey were mocking Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, remained unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car soon pulled into the courtyard of Harvey's private villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A 100-million-dollar villa was, naturally, a sight to behold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had a sunken courtyard, a private cinema, a gym, and a private swimming pool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was also a 24-hour butler service, catering to every whim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the girls piled out of the cars, they immediately started snapping pictures, their phones clicking away like paparazzi at a red-carpet event.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harvey, having made arrangements in advance, had Alvin prepare a lavish party spread in the courtyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He popped open several bottles of champagne with a flourish and clinked glasses with the girls.</span></p><div class="pagination">
