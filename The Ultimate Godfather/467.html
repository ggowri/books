        <h1>Chapter 466 Five Million Dollars</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus effortlessly dodged Ewan's punch with a swift side-step, avoiding the blow with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ewan's eyes flashed with surprise. He hadn't expected Marcus to react so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not bad, huh? But let's see how you handle this one!" Ewan growled, clearly not ready to give up just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He swung his fist again, aiming directly at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Marcus simply sidestepped again, and Ewan's punch sailed through the air, missing him by inches. Ewan was left stunned, his attack failing once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're quick on your feet," Marcus commented casually, his voice smooth. "But this is pointless, Ewan. You're just wasting your time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ewan's face twisted with frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wasn't going to back down so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He attacked again, this time with more intensity, each punch aiming for Marcus' vital spots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The strikes came faster, harder, and less controlled. It was clear that Ewan had stopped treating this like a friendly spar and was now fighting with full aggression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus, however, was in no rush to engage seriously. He continued to evade each blow effortlessly, his movements calm and composed. With one last, nonchalant step back, he was out of range.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Enough of this," Marcus said flatly, his tone disinterested. "This spar is over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He turned to leave, heading toward his Aston Martin, ready to put the situation behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Ewan wasn't finished. His face burned with rage, and with a roar of anger, he lunged, throwing a vicious punch aimed straight at the back of Marcus' head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' eyes narrowed. An attack to the back of the head was one of the dirtiest moves in any fight &mdash; a tactic banned in almost every combat sport.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a move that could easily lead to severe injury or even death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Ewan, in his fury, had crossed the line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without hesitation, Marcus spun on his heel, his palm slamming into Ewan's chest with a force that sent the larger man flying backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ewan's body was sent tumbling through the air, spinning like a ragdoll, before crashing violently to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His teeth shattered, and blood began to pour from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A pitiful scream escaped Ewan's lips as he lay sprawled on the ground, his eyes wide in shock. His gaze turned toward Marcus with a mixture of pain and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The others watching were stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ewan was no amateur fighter; he was one of the top-ranked members of the Tiger Fist Fighting Club, and had even won championships in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet here he was, lying broken on the ground after a single slap from Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The disparity in their skill levels was clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I wasn't holding back because I'm afraid of you, Ewan," Marcus said coolly, his voice laced with sarcasm as he looked down at the fallen fighter. "I just didn't want any trouble. But you pushed me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Marcus turned and walked away, heading for his car. His calm demeanor seemed to make the whole scene feel even more humiliating for Ewan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dammit!" Ewan cursed, clutching his swollen cheek, his face contorted in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His pride had been utterly shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To be humiliated in front of Shannon, the one person he was trying to impress, stung deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He staggered to his feet, his hands still trembling with rage, and turned to Shannon, his voice tight with frustration. "Who is this guy? Tell me everything you know about him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shannon hesitated for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had never expected Marcus to go that far, to humiliate Ewan like that. But she wasn't about to lie for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I only know his name is Marcus. I don't know anything else about him," she said with a casual shrug, her voice detached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, she had already warned Ewan to stay away from Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, the consequences of his stubbornness were on full display.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a cold glance at Ewan, she turned and began to walk toward Solomia University. Ewan's rage only grew as he watched her walk away. The humiliation was unbearable, and he vowed to make Marcus pay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it, I'll make that guy regret this," he growled under his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Turning to the men who had been watching the entire confrontation, Ewan's eyes burned with vengeful determination. "We need to do something about him. Do any of you have any ideas?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of the guys, Quinton, stepped forward. "Ewan, I know a guy in Kingston's Axe Gang. His name's Hayden. They're in Solomia right now, handling some business. Maybe we can get them to deal with Marcus quietly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ewan's face hardened as he thought about it. "You think the Axe Gang can handle him?" he asked, his voice laced with doubt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quinton shrugged. "Well, they've got guns, and you don't. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ewan's eyes narrowed. He knew he wasn't strong enough to take Marcus on his own. The Axe Gang could certainly handle the job. "How much would it cost to have them take care of this?" Ewan asked, his voice now more calculating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quinton raised five fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Five million dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ewan winced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was a lot of money, even for him. His family was wealthy, but he wasn't about to waste half a million dollars just to take down some guy he barely knew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Still, the anger inside him was too strong to ignore. He gritted his teeth. "Fine. I'll pay the five million dollars. And after this is done, I'll buy you all drinks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quinton grinned. "Deal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly dialed Hayden's number, and after a brief conversation, Hayden agreed to the job.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a simple enough task, and an extra five million dollars was always a nice bonus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Axe Gang was known for their efficiency, and it wasn't long before they had Marcus' location pinpointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The hunt for Marcus was about to begin.</span></p></div>
