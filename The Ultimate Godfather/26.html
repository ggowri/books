  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier stormed in, his face a mask of fury. "Who the hell dared to cause trouble here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson pointed an accusatory finger at Marcus. "It's him, Mr. Ulysses! I'm going to make him wish he was never born!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Jackson's eyes, no matter how wealthy Marcus was, he could never measure up to the power of the Golden Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today is going to be Marcus' last day," Jackson thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as Xavier's gaze landed on Marcus, his expression froze in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chairman... No, no... Mr. Fitzgerald, what are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier had witnessed Marcus' impressive presence during the last general manager selection meeting, and he remembered it vividly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was about to address him as chairman, Marcus shot him a discreet glance, and Xavier quickly corrected himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you looking to kill me?" Marcus asked, casually propping his feet up and lighting a cigarette, exhaling smoke in a leisurely manner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier broke into a cold sweat, his face paling. "Mr. Fitzgerald, please don't joke around! I would never dare to offend you! If I had known you were here, I wouldn't have had the guts to come!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson, Amy, Emilia, and Catherine all stood there, completely stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had no idea why Xavier was treating Marcus with such deference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Ulysses, did you just misidentify him? I've never heard of Mr. Fitzgerald in Solomia. This guy must be bluffing! You need to stand up for me, Mr. Ulysses!" Jackson exclaimed, his voice filled with desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Jackson's words, Xavier's demeanor shifted dramatically. Xavier quickly stepped up to Jackson and slapped him hard across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force of the blow sent Jackson reeling, his broken leg buckling beneath him as he tumbled to the ground, blood spilling from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald is not someone we can afford to offend! If you're looking for trouble, don't drag me into it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Jackson and Amy were left speechless, struggling to comprehend the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't fathom what kind of person could command such respect from Xavier, let alone provoke him into violence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson's mind raced as he realized he might have just stepped into a world of trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But is Mr. Ulysses really that powerful? Worthy of your fear? You're the manager of Golden Group's real estate division!" he stammered, still refusing to accept the reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier's anger flared. "Listen up, you little punk! It doesn't matter if I'm just a manager. Even the old-timers at Golden Group bow down to Mr. Fitzgerald. Do you get it now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As those words sank in, Jackson felt the ground beneath him crumble. He slumped helplessly to the floor, his eyes wide with regret and fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amy's expression fell as well, disbelief flooding her features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never imagined that this guy, who looked like a mere driver, could wield such power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine's eyes sparkled with admiration as she looked at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mused, "So Mr. Fitzgerald is that impressive. I guess my earlier worries were totally unfounded!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Jackson in despair, Xavier kicked him sharply. "Get up and apologize to Mr. Fitzgerald right now, or no one will be able to save you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson snapped back to reality. Ignoring the pain in his leg, he scrambled to his feet and crawled toward Marcus, desperation etched on his face. "Mr. Fitzgerald, I'm sorry! I shouldn't have crossed you. It's my fault! Please, for the sake of my ignorance, forgive me this once!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amy kept pleading on behalf of Jackson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at the duo and remarked, "You previously told me to wait, that I wouldn't get out of this sales office. Now, why are you begging me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson's forehead was beaded with cold sweat as he continued to plead, "Mr. Fitzgerald, those were just my reckless words; I'm a fool, please don't take me seriously. If you can forgive me, I'm willing to do anything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus casually replied, "I couldn't care less about you, but I did say you're not fit for this position, and that statement still stands."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier, adept at reading the situation, immediately grasped Marcus' meaning and commanded Jackson, "Jackson, you're fired. Go to finance to settle your previous shares and this month's wages, then you can leave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he turned to Amy. "And you, get out with him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson and Amy were in utter despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had thrived at Cedars Villas sales office, and being fired meant any new job they landed would never match their previous perks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like a career-ending move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both were filled with remorse, regretting their conflict with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing no reconciliation was possible after Xavier's decree, Jackson left the sales office with Amy's support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before exiting, he cast a deep, fleeting look of hatred at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, naturally unbothered by a nobody like Jackson, directly instructed Xavier, "The manager's spot is empty now; I think Catherine Wilson should take it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Xavier nodded and announced to the other sales staff, "Effective from today, Catherine Wilson is the new sales office manager!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catherine's body trembled, her face a mix of disbelief and awe.</span></p><div class="pagination">
