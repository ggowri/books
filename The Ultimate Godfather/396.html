        <h1>Chapter 395 Stunned Everyone</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some people actually used their mobile to count down the five minutes. Five minutes later, a man immediately said sarcastically, "Didn't Marcus say that the HR manager would be here in five minutes? Time is up, and no one comes here. Marcus was just bragging!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I knew Marcus couldn't possibly call the HR manager over. You actually believed him. It's ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Scales laughed sarcastically, "Although Marcus is Catherine's boyfriend, he is not mentally normal. Let's drive him out. Who knows what he will do when he goes crazy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Baily nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, there was a knock on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A man said to the door, "Come in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The door was pushed open, and a man in a suit and gold-rimmed glasses walked into the private room. At first glance, the man was a highly educated intellectual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who are you? We are having a class reunion here. Did you walk into the wrong room?" a man asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sorry to bother you all. I'm Alfred Hershey, the HR manager of Golden Group, and I'm here to see Mr. Fitzgerald," Alfred said politely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though he held a high position at Golden Group, he still appeared to be very approachable. However, his words stunned everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Baily, Sheila, and Betsy widened their eyes in disbelief. Baily asked in a trembling voice, "Who did you say you were here to see? I didn't hear it clearly. Can you repeat it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfred responded, "I'm here to see Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Scales knew Alfred and asked, "Mr. Hershey, could I know who asked you to come here to see Mr. Fitzgerald?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfred then noticed Scales and smiled, "Oh, it's you, Mr. Bernard. Ms. Smith called me to come here to see Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Upon hearing this, everyone present was stunned. Someone thought, "Michelle asked the HR manager of Golden Group to come here to see Marcus. Does this mean that Marcus really knows Michelle? How could he, a braggart, possibly know such a big shot?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many people looked at Marcus in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfred finally noticed Marcus next to Catherine. He immediately stepped forward and said to Marcus respectfully, "Mr. Fitzgerald, I'm Alfred Hershey, the HR manager of Golden Group. Ms. Smith has told me to listen to you. What instructions do you have?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone's hearts skipped a beat. A man thought, "It seems that Marcus really knows Michelle, and from what Alfred said, it can be seen that the relationship between the two seems to be unusual. How could this loser know a big shot like Michelle?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfred lowered his head and stood in front of Marcus. Marcus sat there and asked, "Do you know this person?" As he spoke, he pointed at Scales.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfred glanced at Scales with his head lowered and then replied, "Yes, Mr. Fitzgerald. We have only met a few times in the past few days, but I'm not familiar with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus narrowed his eyes. "He told me that he is very familiar with you and can let all the jobless people here join Golden Group. Regardless of whether they have qualifications or not, you will help them for his sake."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Alfred immediately broke out in a cold sweat and shook his head. "Mr. Fitzgerald, I have only met this man a few times, and I'm not that familiar with him at all. Moreover, I have always followed the company's rules and never allowed anyone to enter the company through privilege. It is impossible for someone without a degree to be recruited!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Alfred so nervous in front of Marcus, everyone was stunned. Someone thought, "Why is Alfred so afraid of Marcus? Could it be that Marcus really has an extraordinary status in Golden Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those who Scales had promised jobs at Golden Group became anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A woman said, "Scales, didn't you promise us that you could help us join Golden Group without requiring academic qualifications? Did you just deceive us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A girl spoke sarcastically, "Yeah, we trusted you so much. You were also bragging."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Scales felt embarrassed and asked Alfred, "Mr. Hershey, you told me before that it's no big deal for you to assign a few people to the company. You have let several of your relatives join the company. Why did you deny it?"</span></p></div>
