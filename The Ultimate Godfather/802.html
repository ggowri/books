  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That afternoon, they boarded a plane to Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, I need a full report on Pablo Ashford from the OIG," Marcus said during a brief break after landing. "Focus on how he handled Benjamin Mitchell's case. If anything looks off, send me the documents ASAP."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's response was quick and efficient. "Understood, Mr. Fitzgerald. Give me thirty minutes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Diana ended the call, diving into the task at hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus knew Diana's capabilities were almost too good to be true. She wasn't just a peak-level Demon Fighter; her investigative skills were second to none.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Digging up dirt on someone like Pablo was child's play for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, less than thirty minutes later, Marcus received a file from Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As expected, the evidence against Benjamin was flimsy at best. A significant portion of it was fabricated through questionable methods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Benjamin was a city-level official, Grace had been notified of his detention location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was being held at a secure facility operated by the OIG.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before approaching Marcus for help, Grace had meticulously prepared evidence, including key financial records and documents from her father's time as mayor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These documents were crucial to disproving the charges and demonstrating Benjamin's innocence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you here for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon arriving at the OIG's headquarters, Grace and Marcus were stopped by a female staff member.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman looked to be in her late twenties, her demeanor crisp and commanding, exuding an air of superiority that made her seem untouchable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're here to see Pablo Ashford," Grace said, her tone steady but firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrest order had come directly from Pablo. Even if they truly intended to detain her father, they owed her a clear and convincing explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her father already behind bars, Grace had nothing left to lose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, she was determined to get some answers&mdash;no matter what it took.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The staff member sized them up, her expression dripping with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me guess, you're not from around here, are you? You must be clueless about how things work here. Mr. Ashford isn't someone you can just waltz in and demand to see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was laced with condescension, and she clearly had no intention of taking them seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace's patience was wearing thin. She raised her voice slightly, her frustration evident. "Are you saying that because Pablo works here, he's above everyone else? Isn't he supposed to serve the people?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The staff member rolled her eyes, letting out a long, exaggerated sigh. "Of course, he serves the people. But if you've got a problem, you'd better spit it out quickly. I don't have time to stand here and argue with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm Grace Mitchell, daughter of Benjamin Mitchell, the mayor of </span><span>Solomia</span><span>. I'm here to ask Pablo Ashford why he had my father arrested," Grace said, her voice rising with authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew her father was innocent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was clearly personal, retaliation stemming from Ryder's corruption.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, the staff member's expression faltered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't expected this fiery young woman to be the daughter of Benjamin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she quickly recovered, her face hardening. In </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> political circles, there was an old saying. "You don't know how small your rank is until you're in Kingston."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin might be the mayor of </span><span>Solomia</span><span>&mdash;a big deal back home&mdash;but here, he was a small fish in a very large pond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The OIG was filled with power players, and even someone like Benjamin didn't carry much weight here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone working here wasn't an average government employee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Take this female staff member, for example&mdash;her family clearly had powerful connections of their own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The staff member straightened her posture and said curtly, "If Mr. Ashford ordered your father's arrest, he must have had a good reason. Your father wouldn't have been detained unless there was something serious to warrant it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And just so you know, Mr. Ashford isn't even here today. He's attending a meeting. You can wait around if you want, but don't cause trouble, or I'll have security deal with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She waved at the nearby security guards, signaling them to stay alert. "Keep an eye on them. If they so much as raise their voices, restrain them and call the police."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards nodded and shot Marcus and Grace cold, superior glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace's face turned red with frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Between her father's arrest and this arrogant staff member's attitude, her nerves were frayed to the breaking point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to hold back, she snapped, "We're here to speak with Pablo Ashford, not to be treated like criminals! Why are you acting like we've committed some unforgivable crime just because we want answers?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
