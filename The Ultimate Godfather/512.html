  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As these words fell, everyone's gaze shifted to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neil and Cloe exchanged glances, faint mockery flickering in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe spoke up, "I admit your medical skills are extraordinary. You even managed to cure late-stage cancer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But don't think that just because you're skilled in medicine, you can influence the dynamics of the Thurman family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, and yes, you're also the head of Golden Group in Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Golden Group, with its mere billion-dollar valuation, is nothing compared to the Whitman family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you insist on getting involved, you'd better think twice about the consequences. If you anger Mr. Whitman, a single word from him could wipe out your Golden Group!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neil smirked coldly and added, "Cloe, this guy is clearly trying to play the hero, attempting to rescue the damsel in distress!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't bother with him. With Mr. Whitman here, I'm curious to see how he plans to make Melina the family heir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Landon's eyes mirrored the ridicule as he turned to Marcus and sneered, "Kid, do you really think your Golden Group has what it takes to compete with the Whitman family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me tell you straight. As long as I'm here, the Thurman family heir will only be Cloe!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Believe it or not, I could make Golden Group go bankrupt with just a word!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Landon's threats, Melina grew anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Marcus had a way of surprising her and had ties to the Burnett family of Kingston, Landon, as the Whitman family's future successor, seemed like an opponent beyond Marcus' current reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lowering her voice, she urged him, "Marcus, I can let go of the inheritance. There's no need for you to fight for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want you to offend the Whitman family because of me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus responded with a reassuring glance. He said, "Don't worry. The Whitman family can't do anything to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he looked up at Landon and said, "From what I know, ever since the death of the Whitman family's patriarch, Barlow, all of the Whitman family's assets have essentially been controlled by the Deleon family. Your father is nothing more than their puppet. I don't understand. What makes you, the son of a puppet, so arrogant in front of me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words struck a nerve, and Landon's expression turned ashen. Gritting his teeth, he said to Marcus, "Yes, you're right. Even if my father is a puppet, he still surpasses your little Golden Group by miles. You're not qualified to compete with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled coldly, "And if the Deleon family decided to take action against you, how would you even begin to defend yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Landon's face darkened at this remark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he quickly smiled coldly, "You're acting as if you know someone from the Deleon family. A country bumpkin from Solomia like you, do you actually think you're important?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you do know someone from the Deleon family, the current head of the Deleon family is my uncle. What do you think you could possibly do to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neil couldn't hold back anymore. He said, "Mr. Whitman, there's no need to waste time on him. Let me call someone to take him down right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Landon raised his hand to stop him, signaling patience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to watch him perform. Once his show is over, we'll make our move."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neil and Cloe immediately understood Landon's intent and began to laugh as well, eager to see Marcus embarrass himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just hope you won't be begging me for mercy later," Marcus said calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without further delay, he pulled out his phone and dialed the number for Oliver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, Mr. Fitzgerald. What are your orders?" came Oliver's firm and authoritative voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's someone named Landon who claims to be the nephew of Jasper. Come handle this. I'm at the Thurman family estate in Kingston."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't say much. He kept it short and to the point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver, being sharp as ever, instantly grasped Marcus' intentions. He said, "Understood, Mr. Fitzgerald. Give me five minutes, and I'll be there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the call ended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Landon, clearly amused, mocked Marcus. "Kid, I'm dying to know who you just called. Your acting skills have thoroughly impressed me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll find out soon enough," Marcus replied with a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no intention of dealing with someone like Landon personally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Landon sneered, his ridicule deepening. He said, "Fine, let's see what kind of tricks you're trying to pull!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neil and Cloe shot Marcus disdainful looks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe chimed in, "Foolish man. To challenge Mr. Whitman, you'll be crying soon enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish her sentence, another group of people entered the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their icy demeanor was evident, and they carried firearms, positioning themselves behind Landon. The atmosphere in the room grew oppressively tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Davey, Kari, and Melina all tensed up, their expressions filled with apprehension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could tell Landon was toying with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcus failed to produce a trump card, the consequences would undoubtedly be brutal.</span></p><div class="pagination">
