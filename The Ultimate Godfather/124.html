        <h1>Chapter 123 Vertex Plaza</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus instructed the taxi driver to turn around and head toward Vertex Plaza.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He soon spotted Josie, elegantly dressed as always.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recently, under Marcus's influence, Josie's aura had transformed entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her complexion glowed, and she exuded an increasing sense of femininity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Linking her arm with Marcus's, Josie first bought some skincare products and then headed straight to the Chaumet counter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a top global jewelry brand, Chaumet's store was exceptionally upscale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Entry required a reservation, and even with one, customers still had to queue at the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Josie's status and wealth, she could have easily skipped the process, but she remained humble and waited for her turn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they stepped inside, Marcus caught sight of a familiar figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail, Marcus's ex-wife, was at the Chaumet store!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beside Abigail was a man dressed head-to-toe in trendy designer wear, sporting gold-rimmed glasses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, through Natalia, Marcus learned that Abigail's family had gone bankrupt due to Felix using her name to secure loans and cash out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To pay off the debt, Abigail resorted to high-interest loans but only sank further into financial ruin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was ultimately sold to a nightclub by an underworld boss and forced to work as a hostess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, in just over a month, Abigail had escaped the nightclub and resurfaced in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, do you know her?" Josie asked, noticing Marcus's reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie seemed to sense something unusual about Marcus's expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave a faint smile. "I used to."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie, perceptive as ever, could see there was more to the story from Marcus's expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't press further and instead led Marcus to a limited-edition diamond necklace on display.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The necklace, showcased on a dedicated stand, held the central spot in the store.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the spotlight, it radiated brilliance and elegance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many were drawn to the necklace but backed away when they saw its hefty price tag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The necklace, priced at 9.5 million dollars, far exceeded Chaumet's average product range.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even among the elite clientele, few could afford it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail hadn't noticed Marcus and Josie. Her hands were full of shopping bags, most containing high-end luxury items.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just at Chaumet, she had bought three pieces of jewelry worth over a million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear the man in trendy clothes beside her was quite wealthy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss, are you interested in this limited-edition diamond necklace?" a sales associate asked Josie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie, captivated by the necklace, nodded. "Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The associate smiled professionally. "This necklace costs 9.5 million dollars. If you'd like to purchase it, we offer installment plans, even with zero down payment..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To the associate, Josie didn't look like someone who could afford such a necklace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she wasn't wearing any particularly valuable items&mdash;not even jewelry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie smiled politely. "No need for installments. I'll pay in full."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The associate was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't expected such an expensive necklace to sell so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It meant a nice commission for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Josie's decision, Marcus handed the associate an international bank card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The associate hesitated briefly, unfamiliar with the card, but said nothing. "Please wait a moment, sir."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took the card and processed the transaction swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie smiled in satisfaction and said, "Thank you, honey."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave a nonchalant shrug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie was a billionaire businesswoman, so a 9.5-million-dollar necklace wasn't particularly extravagant for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail noticed Marcus by chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She froze momentarily, then she had a knowing smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to the man beside her. "Julius, let's go over there and take a look!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man in trendy clothes nodded with a smile, clearly doting on Abigail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, we meet again!" Abigail greeted him first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus gave Abigail a brief glance and said, "What do you want to say?"</span></p></div>
