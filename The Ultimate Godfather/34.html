  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus shagged Jane, she felt an overwhelming sense of fulfillment, as if the void in her heart had finally been filled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She moved with urgency, indulging in the wild sex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was their second time to have sex, and it was far more harmonious than the first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The enclosed space of the car only turned Marcus on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his every movement, the car rocked, groaning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's cries pierced the air outside, raw and unbridled, a testament to her unrestrained desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They shifted from the front seat to the back and eventually outside the car, changing positions relentlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wild sex went on for an hour before they finally collapsed, spent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her legs splayed, Jane collapsed limply onto the seat, the area beneath her soaked and utterly disheveled from their sex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression was one of profound satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being in her early thirties, her experience in sex had been limited before Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It could be said that prior to meeting Marcus, Jane had scarcely known the true delight of orgasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rare moments she had reached her orgasm were self-achieved with the aid of tools, and those experiences paled in comparison to the real sex with a man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body trembled, and her mind was a blank slate. At that moment, she would have been content to die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get up and take me back to Bayside Villa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus urged, seeing Jane still basking in the afterglow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, I love you so much. I really do. I hope you'll fuck me to death one day. You have to keep satisfying me in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a seductive look, Jane forced her heavy eyelids open and stared at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bitch, it's been an hour, and you're still horny?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No. You're potent, turning me on again..." Jane whispered with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she began to straighten her disheveled clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane slipped back into her dress, her demeanor once again reflecting the poised and elegant wife of a wealthy man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car rumbled to life, making its way towards Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, next time, I don't want you to use the condom." Jane asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if you get pregnant? Are you out of your mind? You're such a shameless woman!" Marcus retorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour later, the car halted at the gate of Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is Natalia with you?" Jane inquired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, she was holed up in some rundown rental in the slums. I had someone fetch her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus confirmed with a casual nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, are you being kind, or do you just want to make your sex with Natalia more convenient?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane shot Marcus a playful glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bitch, why is your mind always in the dirty things?" Marcus snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been speaking in earnest, but Jane seemed to steer his words toward that one track of thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, when the image of Natalia's pretty and tender body crossed his mind, a flutter of anticipation stirred within his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I wrong? Didn't you do the same when you were at the Winchester Villa? What's there to argue about?" Jane smiled knowingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What exactly are you trying to say?" Marcus demanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane adjusted her hair, answering, "I don't care about what happened between you and Natalia, or any other woman. I just hope you won't forget about me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus slapped her buttocks playfully yet firmly. "You're such a whore, acting like a scoundrel. Do you really think it's that easy for me to forget you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane laughed softly. "Honey, you're right. Just remember to think of me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Marcus exited the car, Jane kissed him on the cheek like a woman who was in love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus was back at the villa, Diana was engrossed in work in her room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia, fresh from a shower, blow-dried her hair in the living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she spotted Marcus, she put down the dryer and hurried over. "Marcus, are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Certainly," Marcus replied with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A charming smile danced upon her youthful face, lighting up her features with an alluring glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that smile soon froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her delicate face moved closer to Marcus, her nose twitching as she sniffed the air around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You reek of another woman's scent. Spill it, did you sneak off to see someone else?" Natalia accused, clenching her fists and baring her teeth in a gesture that was playful yet carried an undercurrent of real threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus felt a surge of unease. He hadn't anticipated that Natalia, still so young, would possess such sharp intuition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was Jane. She just drove me back," he confessed, hoping to placate her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then why do you smell like her? Did you make love?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia pressed, her eyes narrowing suspiciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No. Don't make assumptions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus lied, his embarrassment growing. After all, Jane had once been his wife's mother, making the situation even more complicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A woman's sixth sense is always right. I just know Jane has feelings for you," Natalia muttered, more to herself than to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued, "And the beautiful woman who picked you up earlier is much prettier than me. Marcus, you're full of surprises!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of the blonde Diana, Natalia sneered, "I used to see you as a pushover, living off my family. But now, not only are you loaded and powerful, but you've got no shortage of women either. Holy crap!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus remained silent. Even without makeup, Natalia was still stunning, possessing the fresh bloom of youth along with an elegance and refinement that was hard to put into words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had Natalia not been born into the formidable ambiance of the Winchester family, Marcus believed that she would have naturally been a kind-hearted girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, you have so many women, but you won't abandon me, right? I gave you my first time. If you dare to leave me, I'll haunt you even as a ghost!" Natalia declared, clenching her fists in determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as you want, you can live here forever. How can you say you're abandoned?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus reassured her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You scumbag, you're not answering my question!" Natalia shot back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shot him a sharp glare and pointedly ignored him, reaching for her cosmetics to begin her skincare routine with meticulous care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus took a shower and retreated to his room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instead of resting, he settled cross-legged on the bed as he delved into the practice of the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.</span></p><div class="pagination">
