  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next to Cloe stood a tall, confident young man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he didn't speak, the expression on his face radiated an air of natural self-assurance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just standing there casually, he seemed to radiate an aura that few could match, making it clear that his identity was far from ordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man's eyes briefly scanned Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed he found nothing of particular interest, so he quickly looked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is my boyfriend, Marcus Fitzgerald. He's from Solomia. I heard my grandfather is ill, so he rushed here to visit," Melina said, introducing Marcus to Cloe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe's eyes flickered with interest, and she couldn't help but glance at Marcus a little longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe knew Melina well. They were both women of a certain standing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of their status and beauty, they had always been surrounded by suitors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, even the young men from well-known families in Kingston rarely caught Melina's eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, this young man, who seemed utterly ordinary and came from a small place like Solomia, had somehow earned the title of Melina's boyfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe remembered that this was probably the first time Melina had publicly acknowledged someone as her boyfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Melina spoke, the room fell silent, and everyone's eyes turned toward her with surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina's mother, Kari Thurman, darkened as she spoke. "Melina, when did you get a boyfriend? Why didn't you discuss this with your father and me first?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And with your grandfather in such a state, what good is it to have him here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really never make it easy for us. There are so many young heirs from Kingston's top families who would have gladly pursued you, but you didn't give them a chance. And instead, you choose someone from a tiny place like Solomia. It's infuriating!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina's father, Davey Thurman, cast a cold glance at Marcus, his eyes full of disdain. "Melina, why do you have no taste at all? Just look at Cloe. She was always like you, never interested in love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she found someone like Mr. Whitman, a perfect match. Even Mr. Zack is only helping your grandfather because of Mr. Whitman's influence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you? You've chosen a country bumpkin from Solomia. You've completely embarrassed me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We don't have time to deal with you right now. Once your grandfather's funeral is over, I'll make sure Cloe introduces you to someone worthy of your time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Davey and Kari spoke, Melina's uncle, Neil Thurman, and Cloe both exchanged proud glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe's relationship with Landon Whitman had been a huge win for the Thurman family, earning them respect and recognition in the circles of Kingston's elite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had made the Thurman family the talk of top-tier families recently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason for this was simple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Landon hailed from the Whitman family, one of the four major families in Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlow Whitman, the former head of the Whitman family, had been killed by Marcus on a dark and stormy night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Barlow's death, his cousin, Valentin Whitman, took over the family business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Valentin was Landon's father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the blow to the Whitman family's strength after Barlow's untimely death, they remained one of the most powerful families in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, Valentin's sister, Kassandra Deleon, was married to Jasper, the head of the Deleon family in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, after Barlow's death, the Whitman family's survival and continued prominence were likely due to the support of the Deleon family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the two families had a marriage alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Barlow was head of the Whitman family, Kassandra could ignore the family's matters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with Valentin now at the helm and the family in turmoil after Barlow's death, Kassandra had to step in to stabilize the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This alliance with the Deleon family ensured the Whitman family remained powerful, even after Barlow's passing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Jasper had also taken control of much of the Whitman family's assets, essentially making Valentin a puppet of the Deleon family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was just a glimpse of the behind-the-scenes power struggles and interest competition between the top families of Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was an intricate web of alliances and betrayals that ordinary people and even second-tier families couldn't fully grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the son of Valentin Whitman, the current head of the Whitman family, Landon still attracted immense attention, not just in Kingston but across Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His status and reputation were no less significant than Shaun's had been in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since that was the situation, Cloe's relationship with Landon was a point of immense pride, especially for the Thurman family, which barely qualified as a second-tier family in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Cloe and Landon established their relationship, Landon swiftly poured a substantial investment into the Thurman family's Flourish Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The investment amounted to billions of dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, with Bowden's deteriorating health, Landon had used his connections to bring Tom Zack from the Celestial Arc Order to attempt to extend the old man's life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made the Thurman family treat Landon with even greater respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was because Cloe had found Landon as a boyfriend that her position within the Thurman family had surpassed Melina's. Cloe had become the most formidable contender for the next generation's inheritance.</span></p><div class="pagination">
