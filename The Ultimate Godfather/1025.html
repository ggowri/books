  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Starting next month, I'm raising your annual salary to 50 million dollars," Marcus said casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To someone of his wealth, 50 million dollars was mere pocket change. But using that money to secure an excellent manager like Evander was worth it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after Marcus spoke, both Callista and Evander froze in place, certain they must have misheard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fifty million dollars... Mr. Fitzgerald, isn't that a bit excessive?" Evander asked, his voice trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His previous annual salary had been only five million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was giving him a tenfold increase!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd heard of raises of fifty percent, maybe even double, but never a raise that multiplied someone's salary by ten!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed almost too generous to be true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why Evander couldn't believe it, thinking Marcus must be joking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Callista's face also showed complete disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied, "Not at all. Just for helping Royal Entertainment escape its crisis and return to the top of the industry, you've earned every penny of that 50-million-dollar annual salary. Keep up the good work. I </span><span>expect seeing even</span><span> greater achievements</span><span> from you</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evander's face lit up with excitement as he listened to Marcus' words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, he felt a deep sense of gratitude toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before joining Royal Entertainment, Evander had worked at other entertainment companies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>T</span><span>oday, boss</span><span>es from</span><span> entertainment compan</span><span>ies</span><span> </span><span>were always trying</span><span> to exploit their employees somehow</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most bosses put on one face in public and show another in private, desperate to spend the least money while hiring the most talented people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was the first genuinely generous boss Evander had ever encountered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd increased Evander's annual salary tenfold to 50 million dollars, nearly equivalent to what the CEO of a major publicly traded company would earn!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Evander was merely the Executive Vice President of Royal Entertainment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even at other top entertainment companies in Uswad that competed with Royal Entertainment, the highest-paid Executive Vice Presidents never made more than 10 million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Usually, their salaries hovered around five million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It meant Evander's previous five-million-dollar salary had been perfectly normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This generosity made Evander grateful to Marcus and determined to work hard and repay him for recognizing his talent and worth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Additionally, I'm thinking of promoting you to President of Royal Entertainment. Do you think you're up for it?" Marcus' voice came through almost simultaneously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evander's expression froze momentarily before his face lit up with even more excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I'm confident that I can build Royal Entertainment into something truly remarkable. I'll expand our reach into the Uswad mainland market and work tirelessly to make us the number one entertainment company in all of Uswad!" Evander declared with some hesitation at first, but his voice quickly grew bold and determined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before coming here today, he had only hoped to convince Marcus to appear at the Luminara Awards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never imagined that so many wonderful opportunities would fall into his lap one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It gave Evander a surreal feeling like he might be dreaming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good. Then starting today, you are the new president of Royal Entertainment!" Marcus announced directly, pleased to see Evander's enthusiasm and drive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As president, Evander would naturally gain more authority, enabling him to manage Royal Entertainment more effectively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for this promotion, Mr. Fitzgerald. I will not let you down from this day forward. I promise to excel in my responsibilities and lead Royal Entertainment to even greater heights!" Evander pledged fervently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved his hand dismissively at Evander. Then his gaze shifted to Callista as he asked, "You're the chairman's assistant, which means you're my assistant, correct?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Callista's beautiful eyes flickered as she nodded gently. "Although I've never actually met Mr. Fitzgerald before, I am indeed Mr. Fitzgerald's assistant. When Mr. Fitzgerald doesn't come to the Royal Entertainment office, I help Mr. Bishop handle various other matters."</span></p><div class="pagination">
