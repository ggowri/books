        <h1>Chapter 496 You Don't Deserve It</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus froze for a moment, clearly not recognizing Clayton. "You are...?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clayton, unfazed, maintained his respectful demeanor. "I'm Clayton Prescott, the owner of Le Vieux Ch&acirc;teau. Solomia's mayor, Benjamin Mitchell, is my sister's husband."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I see," Marcus replied, now understanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, since you are here, today's meal is on the house!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of his hand, Clayton turned to the staff and issued his command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The waiters immediately nodded and acknowledged the order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle, Penny, and Jeremy all felt a jolt of surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Le Vieux Ch&acirc;teau was a renowned restaurant in Solomia, primarily catering to the city's elite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even government officials often hosted their guests here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to its high demand, the restaurant never offered discounts to anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Clayton had just made the rare decision to waive the bill for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though there were only a few of them, their meal consisted of expensive dishes that easily totaled over one hundred thousand dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made it clear just how highly Clayton regarded Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, since you insist, I'll accept it," Marcus said coolly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had decided to repay this favor to Benjamin at a later time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, if you need anything, just let me know. Whatever I can do for you, I will do without hesitation," Clayton said, bowing slightly, his face full of respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clayton bid Marcus farewell, leaving the room without acknowledging Kyle, Penny, or Jeremy at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle, Penny, and Jeremy couldn't help but feel a sting of disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially Kyle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had made a point of greeting Clayton earlier, only for Clayton to ignore him completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp contrast left Kyle feeling utterly embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy, on the other hand, was consumed by despair. But that despair quickly turned to deep hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We should go," Marcus said, not bothering to acknowledge Kyle, Penny, or Jeremy. He turned to Shannon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon nodded obediently, standing up and linking her arm with Marcus'.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After exchanging a brief word with Kyle and Penny, she prepared to leave the private room with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as they turned to go, Jeremy suddenly grabbed a steel fork from the table and lunged toward Marcus' temple!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You ruined me, so now I'll make sure you die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy's voice was frantic, his face twisted with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle and Penny both gasped, shocked by Jeremy's sudden, reckless aggression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Jeremy's fork could reach its target, Marcus swiftly spun around and grabbed Jeremy's wrist with a vice-like grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy's face turned pale with shock. He hadn't expected Marcus' reflexes to be so fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He struggled fiercely to free himself, but it was futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' hand was like iron, and he felt an overwhelming, unyielding force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got some nerve. Let go of me, and I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy's eyes were bloodshot as he raised his leg, aiming a vicious kick at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' brow furrowed. Without hesitation, he twisted Jeremy's wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a sickening crack as Jeremy's arm snapped!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy screamed in agony, his face turning ghostly pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus followed up with a kick that sent Jeremy flying across the room, slamming him into the wall of the private room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think you can lay a hand on me? You don't deserve it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sneered as he looked down at Jeremy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy, drenched in sweat from the pain, didn't dare move, too terrified even to make a sound. He could only watch as Marcus led Shannon out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once outside Le Vieux Ch&acirc;teau, Shannon gazed up at Marcus, her eyes filled with even more admiration than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If, earlier, she had admired Marcus purely for his strength when he defeated Easton, now her admiration was all-encompassing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She admired him in every way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't expected that Marcus was not only strong but also wealthy, with</span><span> </span><span>connections far beyond anything she could have imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This realization stirred a new feeling in Shannon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I really owe you one today. With your impressive display, I doubt my uncle and aunt will ever try to set me up with anyone again," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon could tell that Kyle and Penny were just as shocked by Marcus' power as she was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as she didn't announce a breakup with him, not only would her uncle and aunt likely give up on matchmaking her, but others would, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about this, Shannon felt even more grateful to Marcus. At least for the next few years, she wouldn't have to deal with annoying matchmaking attempts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As I promised, I'll do my best to help you," Marcus said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, you're too kind..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon beamed back at him, squeezing his arm tighter, her grip almost possessive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had even pressed her body closer, feeling the warmth of Marcus' arm against her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus could feel her soft form against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you heading back to school? I can take you there," he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of parting from him left Shannon feeling a pang of disappointment deep inside.</span></p></div>
