        <h1>Chapter 125 Admiration</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, the service assistant appeared somewhat tempted and tried to persuade Josie, saying, "Miss, would you consider giving this necklace to this gentleman? If you do, our store would be willing to pay you a penalty of 200 thousand dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after paying the penalty, the shop would still make a profit of 300 thousand dollars&mdash;definitely a winning deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie firmly declined, "I've purchased this necklace, and I won't give it to anyone else. It belongs to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Josie had a gentle nature and preferred not to compete with others, this was a different situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail, Marcus's ex-wife, had been provoking her, successfully igniting Josie's competitive spirit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want a bigger payout, right? How about 11 million dollars? If you're willing to part with this necklace, I'll give you 11 million dollars!" the man offered a significantly higher amount.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed that even a wealthy person like Josie would be tempted by more than a million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie shook her head again, "This necklace is mine, and no amount of money will make me give it up. Just let it go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man frowned and replied coldly, "I'm warning you, don't push your luck. Do you have any idea who I am?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My uncle is Stephen Andrade, the new president of Sync Group. If you refuse to hand over that necklace, I'll make your life difficult here in Kingston!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The commotion drew the attention of other customers at the counter, many of whom were visibly shocked by the revelation of his identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sync Group was a highly competitive, emerging tech industry leader in Kingston with a market value of 80 billion dollars, renowned throughout Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group once belonged to the Brown family of Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Ricardo's death, the group was acquired by a mysterious figure known as Death, who appointed Stephen as the new president.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did Stephen hold 10% of Sync Group's shares, but the Andrade family also had considerable influence in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Stephen had no children of his own, he raised his nephew, Julius Andrade, as his son, making Julius a wealthy figure in the high society of Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, when people witnessed Josie arguing with Julius, many speculated that she would back down once his identity was revealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To everyone's surprise, Josie remained unyielding, stating, "Your identity doesn't concern me. I'll say it again: the necklace is mine, and I won't give it to anyone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she reached for the necklace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius grabbed her wrist and snatched it away, saying, "You bitch. I've already been more than accommodating; what more do you want?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter who shows up today, that necklace belongs to Abigail!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Julius looking so domineering, Abigail couldn't help but wink at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius immediately felt proud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before he could revel in his victory, Marcus kicked him in the abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius cried out in pain, releasing his grip and collapsing to the floor, groaning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus swiftly snatched the necklace back, took out a wet wipe, and meticulously cleaned it before placing it around Josie's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once adorned with the limited-edition necklace, Josie looked extraordinarily elegant and stunning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie gazed at Marcus with admiration in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other hand, Abigail's expression darkened. She scoffed, "Marcus, this is what you got? Resorting to violence whenever you face a problem? You'll never achieve anything significant that way!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's the nephew of Mr. Stephen Andrade, the president of Sync Group. Now that you've hit him, you'll have to face the consequences from Mr. Andrade!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Abigail helped Julius up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After catching his breath, Julius shouted at Marcus, "You loser! I'll ruin you and that bitch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached for his phone, ready to make a call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a voice from the crowd broke through, "That woman looks familiar. Oh, I remember now; I saw her on TV!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's the founder of BioFusion Pharmaceuticals and a representative of outstanding female entrepreneurs in Kingston, Ms. Josie Shelman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, that's who she is! No wonder she's so beautiful and graceful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even though Julius is Stephen's nephew, he may not be able to touch Ms. Shelman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Upon hearing the comments from those around her, Abigail asked with concern, "Mr. Julius Andrade, which is better: BioFusion Pharmaceuticals or your uncle's Sync Group?"</span></p></div>
