        <h1>Chapter 144 I Will Kill You</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley nodded and said, "Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said, "In that case, I won't give you the 300 thousand dollars he owes you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he threw a punch at Stanley in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a loud bang. Before Stanley could react, Marcus knocked him down to the floor. His eyeballs were bruised, and blood oozed out...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley felt dizzy. He had never expected Marcus to attack him suddenly, and neither had his burly men. It took them a long time to come back to their senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you punch me! I will kill you today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley staggered to his feet from the floor and swung the machete towards Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus kicked him in the abdomen. Stanley screamed and collapsed again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His burly men picked up stools and smashed them at Marcus without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus remained calm and soon defeated the burly men, leaving them crying out in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, you have guts and can fight well, but since you hit me, your life will definitely be taken tonight. Wait for me here, and I will bring men over to kill you right away!" Stanley said through gritted teeth, covering his stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost! Don't let me see you again, or I won't show mercy!" Marcus warned coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't bother to pay any attention to these scoundrels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley glared at Marcus and then left with his men in fright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip gazed admiringly at Marcus, amazed by his excellent fighting skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine immediately stepped forward and exclaimed, "Mr. Fitzgerald, thank you. Otherwise, my dad would definitely have suffered today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved his hand and said, "You are welcome."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you believe you are handsome and powerful?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Thomas, who had been struck dumb by Stanley, sneered, "If my memory serves me correctly, Stanley is a member of the Shadow Syndicate, a subordinate of Toby Scott's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You beat him. It seems like you helped Catherine and her family, but in fact, you got yourself into big trouble. Both you and they have to pay the price!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura immediately felt scared and asked, "Catherine, is it true?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine nodded. "I have indeed heard of the Shadow Syndicate. It is one of the most powerful gangs in the Solomia underworld, as famous as the Serpent's Coil. Stanley seems to be from there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip added, "The Shadow Syndicate is an organization I've wanted to join in the past, but I've never got the chance. Otherwise, I would definitely not have been afraid of Stanley!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The conversation between Catherine and Philip panicked Laura even more. "What should we do? What should we do? The Shadow Syndicate is so formidable. How can we afford to provoke it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes were shining with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recently, he had been listening to Edgar's reports.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past few days, the Serpent's Coil and the Shadow Syndicate had been in constant conflict, big and small, and in disputes over territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Shadow Syndicate was stronger than the Serpent's Coil. Tory's death affected the strength of the Serpent's Coil to a certain extent, resulting in it not having an advantage in the conflict and even being suppressed by the Shadow Syndicate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Marcus' surprise, he ran into people from the Shadow Syndicate at a dinner party today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Catherine, I have something else to do, so I'll leave now. You and your parents should quickly find a place to hide. We can't afford to offend the people from the Shadow Syndicate," Thomas advised, not wanting to be implicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before Thomas could step out of the house, there was a scolding from downstairs. "Philip, come downstairs with your family immediately. I've brought Toby here. You can't escape!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Stanley. How arrogant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas' face darkened. He never dreamed that Toby would come so soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't want to be implicated, but it seemed impossible for him to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was thinking about how to protect himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, please leave through the back door. There is a fire escape. Don't worry about us. He is looking for you. He will not harm us," Catherine urged, unwilling to involve Marcus in her family affairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said, "Don't worry. I have always wanted to meet someone from the Shadow Syndicate, and today is a good opportunity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he pushed the door open and walked downstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine was worried about him. She asked Laura to wait upstairs, and she and Philip chased after Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fearing that the people from the Shadow Syndicate would go upstairs to catch him, Thomas had to follow them downstairs.</span></p></div>
