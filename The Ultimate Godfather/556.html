        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lunged straight towards Lila, kneading Lila's boobs while touching the mysterious area that was already wet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Lila's delicate body madly trembled as if she had been electrocuted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus' finger touched the bump in Lila's sensitive area, Lila's body even shuddered wildly, and her lower body contracted wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just this one touch made her reach the orgasms, and the whole person was once again let loose, </span><span>her</span><span> </span><span>mind going blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A great sense of relief swept over her, making her feel like she was the happiest woman in the world at the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus only felt his fingers become silkier as they were wrapped in a hot current.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't afford that. He quickly backed himself out of his clothes, his big dick already hard and swollen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus aimed directly at the vagina and slowly thrust in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a sharp pain swept over her, causing an agonizing moan to escape from Lila's mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intense tearing sensation wiped out the blissful feeling of her previous arousal, replacing it with endless pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It hurts... it hurts..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila tried to make the evil thing inside her withdraw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus didn't even give her a chance and started moving in a rhythmic motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As their flesh continued to rub together, the horrible swelling and pain disappeared just a little bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In its place was a powerful sense of relief, a sense of relief that was many times more intense than when Marcus had treated her ankle earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made her feel like she was flying in the clouds for a moment, and the emptiness inside her entire being was filled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus' Dual Cultivation blossomed, the soothing feeling that was already strong enough was once again doubled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Lila climbed to her second peak. Her whole body was deflated, completely drained of strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waves of intense bliss swept over Lila as Marcus kept pounding away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It sent Lila's entire being into an endless rush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She desperately catered to it, the moans coming out of her mouth growing more and more soulful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald... yes... I'm so comfortable... you're so big there, I'm filled up with you... I want you to fuck me harder!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila made such lustful noises from her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed out of place with her country style beauty feeling that was pure and lustful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A vast contrast was formed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Marcus' previous impression, Lila was like a fairy tale nymph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And at this moment, being pressed under him, this woman was transformed into a bed slut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was she flirty, but she was also compassionate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A casual touch can give Marcus extreme feedback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It can significantly stimulate his manly desire to conquer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He changed positions many times, and each time, Lila was able to be sent to her peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intensity of the contractions on her lower body made Marcus want to go on and on, experiencing an unprecedented feeling of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before that, he wouldn't have imagined that the actress he was listening to before would be pinned down underneath him and thrusting with abandon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sensation was genuinely marvelous and soothing as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more intense Lila's screams became, the more incredible Marcus' satisfaction became.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus even surpassed his usual performance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, it lasted a full two hours before the flames of passion were finally extinguished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila was sent to the peak of ecstasy nine times in a row by Marcus and fainted dead away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once pink and tidy bed </span><span>was</span><span> now a mess, soaked with various fluids and emitting an alluring scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Lila, who had fainted from the intense pleasure he gave her, Marcus felt a sense of accomplishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using the remaining time, Marcus began to cultivate and study the Heavenly Circle Diagram.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his last battle with the Grandmaster of the Black Dragon Society, if he hadn't had the assistance of the Heavenly Circle Diagram, he might very well have been no match for his opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That battle made Marcus realize the power of Rune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could master all the Runes inscribed within the Heavenly Circle Diagram, his fighting ability would skyrocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spent the entire night practicing one specific Rune, getting a solid grasp of its inscription method and key principles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, deep beneath the Arctic Citadel, in the heart of the command center, Roger stood before a detailed map of the region, his eyes glinting with a steely determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cut a striking figure in his combat fatigues, his tall, athletic frame, and classically handsome features marking him as a man of action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His piercing blue eyes radiated an almost regal authority, like a modern-day sovereign surveying his domain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beside him stood a stunning blonde woman, her curves accentuated by a form-fitting uniform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gellar," she began, her voice laced with concern, "that man has become increasingly bold. First, he decimated the Cole family in </span><span>Acoton</span><span>, and now there's strong evidence linking him to the downfall of the Black Dragon Society. If you don't intervene soon and allow him to continue growing in power, he may become uncontrollable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger's expression hardened. "As I've explained before, if I deal with him, Godfather will not hesitate to retaliate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then allow me to handle it!"</span></p></div>
