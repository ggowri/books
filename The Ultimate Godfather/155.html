        <h1>Chapter 154 Training the Fiery Beauty</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes lit up at the sight of Maxine. He had to admit&mdash;Maxine was stunning. There was a cool, detached air about her, the kind of vibe that could stir up a man's instinct to conquer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to change into something else first?" Maxine asked, her tone noticeably softer than when they'd first met. The sharpness she once carried was nowhere to be seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need." Marcus waved her off. He then asked, "What exactly do you want to learn? Just ask away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine stepped closer, bringing with her a faint, delicate fragrance. "I want to learn the move you used to beat Edward that day," she said directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edward was a former national fighting champion, widely considered the best in their academy. The fact that Marcus had thrown him off the ring spoke volumes about his skill. Sure, Edward's overconfidence and Marcus' element of surprise had played a part, but the feat had left a deep impression on Maxine nonetheless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled nonchalantly, "That move? Honestly, it's not as complicated as you think. It all comes down to a phrase."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's eyes sparkled with curiosity. "What phrase?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay calm, outsmart your opponent, and use their strength against them," Marcus replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly threw a punch at Maxine without warning. Her brows furrowed, but she reacted instantly, twisting her body in a swift, graceful dodge. With barely a pause, she retaliated with a sharp hook aimed straight at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't dodge this time. Just as her punch was about to connect, he shifted his angle with lightning speed, grabbing her arm with both hands. Using the momentum of her own strike, he effortlessly flipped her over and sent her flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine yelped in surprise as her body lost all sense of balance, tumbling backward toward the ground. Just as she braced herself for impact, Marcus caught her mid-fall, his movements smooth and precise, almost elegant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, she found herself staring at Marcus' chiseled features, so close she could feel his breath. Her heart skipped a beat, though she couldn't quite explain why.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This," Marcus said matter-of-factly, as though completely unaware of their compromising position, "is how you stay calm, outsmart your opponent, and use their strength against them. Got it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine blinked, trying to steady herself. "I think I get it... kind of," she admitted. Experiencing it firsthand made her appreciate just how clever and subtle his technique was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her insistence, Marcus demonstrated the move a few more times. Every time, she thought she was ready for him, only to find herself helplessly thrown off balance again. And every time, without fail, Marcus would catch her before she hit the ground, always with the same gentlemanly finesse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before they knew it, two hours had passed. Under Marcus' patient guidance, Maxine had gained a deeper understanding of her grappling techniques. She asked, "Marcus, can you show me that move again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her enthusiasm was at an all-time high&mdash;only one move remained for her to fully grasp. Marcus nodded, gracefully flipping her through the air again and catching her with practiced ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Maxine's feet touched the ground, half-reclined in Marcus' arms, she looked up </span><span>at him with gratitude and said, "Thank you, Marcus. I think I've got the hang of it now. I really appreciate your help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gently helped her stand, his expression unreadable but composed. This scene played out entirely in Edward's line of sight. His fists clenched tightly, and his gaze at Marcus burned with resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, Edward had gone to look for Maxine, hoping to teach her some fighting techniques before the international combat tournament. Upon finding her dorm empty, he asked around and learned she had come to this gym.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Technically, the rented space was off-limits to outsiders, but Edward used his position to gain access. He arrived just in time to see Marcus catching Maxine in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edward couldn't hold back and demanded, "Maxine, didn't I say I'd personally teach you some combat techniques? What are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine finally noticed him and frowned, "I rented this space. How did you even get in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edward sneered, "So that's why the staff kept trying to stop me. You went out of your way to rent a private area just to meet him? You've really thought this through, haven't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing how unreasonable he was being, Maxine started to get angry, too. "I invited Marcus here to learn grappling techniques. How is that such a big deal that you're twisting my words and intentions?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edward shook his head with a bitter sneer. "Don't bother explaining. I told you I'd teach you myself, and yet you ignored me and came running here. What else is there to say?"</span></p></div>
