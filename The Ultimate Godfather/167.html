  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was shocked, thinking, "What is going on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Has Professor Cooper just lost control?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did he bow to an outsider and act so humble?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is simply unbelievable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young doctor thought Robert had lost his mind. He couldn't help but mutter to him, "Professor Cooper, this diagram looks like a complete mess. It has nothing to do with medical practice. Did you make a mistake?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone turned to Robert, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brenden, especially, was worried that Robert might have really lost his mind or was seeing things, which could lead to a disastrous surgery outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, if that happened, Edward would be done for!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I told you to shut up before, didn't I? Why are you speaking now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the young doctor's words seemed to have triggered Robert completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face darkened with cold fury, "Tomorrow, you'll be on outpatient duty. Don't follow me anymore. I don't need a student like you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, the young doctor felt the ground spinning beneath him. He nearly collapsed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had only gotten this opportunity to study under Robert through connections and the last of his parents' savings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, all that was lost because of his careless comment!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't understand what had happened to Robert and why he was so obsessed with this messy drawing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you all looking at? If anyone dares to speak out again, you'll end up like him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert swept his gaze over the other young doctors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' diagram had opened the door to a whole new world for Robert!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After looking at it, problems that had plagued him for years were suddenly solved!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Robert, this seemingly messy diagram was more precious than gold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was worth more than any high-level medical theory out there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, can we begin the surgery now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert forced himself to calm his excitement and turned to Marcus, speaking as a subordinate would to his superior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, we can begin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only after receiving Marcus' approval did Robert dare to prepare for the surgery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene left Benjamin, Brenden, and Maxine stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't quite process what was going on. They couldn't figure out what was happening between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All they could do was wait and watch, their minds in a haze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The surgery will take about four hours. I'll be on my way now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said his goodbyes to Benjamin, Brenden, and Maxine as he left the clinic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had more important things to do and wasn't about to wait around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed with his guidance and Robert's years of clinical </span><span>experience,</span><span> Edward's recovery was almost certain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, then I'll walk you out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine nodded but wasn't overly insistent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need. I can go on my own."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus shook his head and left without another word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching his retreating figure, Brenden turned to Maxine, asking, "Maxine, do you think Mr. Fitzgerald really knows medicine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine shook her head. "He never mentioned it before, and I'm not sure. But seeing how Professor Cooper reacted, maybe he does know a thing or two..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her words, Maxine's heart still felt uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Edward was her instructor, and she didn't want him to be crippled for the rest of his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brenden sighed, not holding out much hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Believing that the young man, in his twenties, had easily defeated a half-mechanical person was already a stretch for him. However, it was even more difficult for him to accept that the same young man had knowledge of medicine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brenden had mentally prepared himself for the surgery to fail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus had predicted, the surgery lasted a full four hours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin hadn't left, still waiting outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During that time, Brenden sighed frequently, filled with guilt for Edward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine was clearly tense as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the surgery door finally opened, the two of them rushed forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brenden spoke first, his voice tinged with worry, "Professor Cooper, how did it go? You don't have to feel guilty; you did your best. Even if Edward has to spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair, our academy will compensate him well so that he'll have no worries."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At those words, Maxine's hopes gradually faded. She could feel the flicker of hope inside her extinguishing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What guilt? Brenden, what are you talking about? The surgery was a success!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert pulled off his mask, clearly bewildered by Brenden's strange attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Marcus' insightful guidance, he had never thought the surgery would fail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Robert's words didn't bring much relief to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brenden seemed to be in disbelief, shaking his head, "Professor Cooper, I already prepared myself for the surgery to fail. Please, just tell me the truth. No need to comfort me with lies!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
