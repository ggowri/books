  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Easton gritted his teeth in pain, slowly rising to his feet. With an angry snarl, he glared at Marcus. "You're always so underhanded. You ambushed me like a coward. Even if you won, it's a hollow victory!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Easton had an uncanny ability to twist the truth, and his shamelessness was remarkable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite the fact that it was he who had attacked Marcus first, he was now accusing Marcus of being deceitful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus, however, wasn't interested in engaging in a petty argument. With a cold smile, he lazily waved a finger at Easton. "Quit running your mouth. If you've got the guts, prove it by defeating me in the ring. If you fail, apologize for insulting Uswad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd's jeers and taunts grew louder, further fueling Easton's rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a roar, he lunged at Marcus, his fists slashing through the air with deadly force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each punch carried tremendous weight, and for an average person, they would have been nearly impossible to withstand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in Marcus' presence, Easton's strikes seemed weak, almost pathetic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without any unnecessary flourishes, Marcus casually swept out one leg in a fluid motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sound of the impact echoed through the arena, followed by Easton's painful scream as his body was sent crashing to the ground, utterly disoriented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Still want to keep going?" Marcus asked nonchalantly, not in a rush to finish him off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instead, he toyed with Easton, almost as if playing with a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For Easton, this was the ultimate humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With great difficulty, he managed to stagger to his feet again. "If you're a real man, fight me head-on! Stop hiding behind these cheap tricks. Is this how all the men of Uswad fight&mdash;sneaky and dishonorable?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He took slow, cautious steps toward Marcus, his eyes flicking warily to Marcus' arms and legs, searching for an opening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, in a sudden burst of speed, Easton launched a rapid series of kicks aimed directly at Marcus' head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a ninth-degree black belt in Karate, Easton's kick was impressive&mdash;fast, powerful, and expertly executed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For most people, it would have been a lethal move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shannon, watching from the sidelines, couldn't help but gasp in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now she understood&mdash;when she fought Easton, he hadn't used his full strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he had unleashed this combination of kicks back then, she might have been defeated in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A new wave of concern for Marcus washed over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet Marcus' expression remained unchanged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Calmly, he stood his ground, unflinching, as Easton's kicks whizzed toward him. At the last possible moment, he casually threw out a single punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sharp sound of impact resonated through the arena. Easton let out another pained yell, his body flying backward as Marcus' fist collided squarely with his abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The blow sent Easton crashing hard to the edge of the ring, his body sprawled out, his breath ragged with pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter how flashy Easton's moves were, they were nothing in front of Marcus&mdash;one punch was all it took to put him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a total domination&mdash;absolute, crushing force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the crowd erupted into applause, it became clear to everyone. Marcus wasn't just boasting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Easton, who had been undefeated before, was nothing more than a child playing at martial arts compared to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter what Easton threw at him, Marcus effortlessly countered every move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd erupted once more, their cheers like a roaring wave crashing against the shore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was then that everyone understood. Marcus' earlier words weren't just empty boasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Easton had most likely been one of his previous victims, already defeated by him long before this challenge. And for those who had doubted Marcus' words, they were now forced to silence themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is that all you've got?" Marcus taunted. "I suggest you go back and train for a few more years before you come at me again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Easton was now visibly broken, gritting his teeth in pain, his fighting spirit completely crushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he lay defeated in the ring, Shannon's eyes flickered with admiration. Something inside her clicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had made up her mind&mdash;she had to meet Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a female fighter deeply obsessed with martial arts, Shannon felt an innate respect for those stronger than herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She longed to learn from them, to refine her skills under their tutelage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But before Marcus could step down from the ring, a new figure appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A middle-aged man, perhaps in his early forties, jumped out from the crowd, effortlessly landing in front of Marcus, blocking his path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' eyes sharpened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The newcomer was dressed in traditional Crankhurst attire, a battle blade strapped to his waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was a distinct air about him&mdash;this man was no ordinary opponent. He was something more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A ninja.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The term flashed through Marcus' mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the same way Uswad had its Ancient Martial Arts, Crankhurst had its own unique warriors&mdash;Ninjas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their ranks ranged from one to nine, and this man felt like a level-three ninja, already an expert in his field.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I challenge you to a fight, if you'll accept," the middle-aged ninja said, his Uswad not quite fluent, but clear enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' lips curled into a slight smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're not my match. I suggest you step down and save yourself the trouble."</span></p><div class="pagination">
