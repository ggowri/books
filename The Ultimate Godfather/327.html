  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus opened the door, still half-asleep, only to find Jade standing outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus was stunned and asked, "What are you doing here so early? Don't you sleep?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade said, "What, you're not happy to see me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In her mind, though, she was thinking, "This guy's ridiculously lazy. The sun's practically up, and he's still in bed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Come in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus gestured toward the living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Can you put on your clothes?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade said with a hint of disgust, noticing Marcus was only wearing boxers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus shrugged, grabbed a bathrobe, and lazily lounged on the couch, lighting a cigarette. "So, what do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jordon and his grandson are dead," Jade said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' eyes flickered briefly. "What does that have to do with me? Just say what you came here for."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade bit her lip, looking slightly embarrassed, but she finally said, "I was supposed to go to Acoton for advanced training with Jordon. Now that they're dead, my plans are ruined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, my dad sent me to ask you to take me as your student."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus frowned, but before he could speak, Jade quickly added, "Don't say no yet! You don't have to teach me anything. Just agree to be my master in name only. My dad won't make me go abroad for training then. That's all I need!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus looked her up and down and said, "What if I don't even agree to that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade's face turned red with frustration. "You really think you're that special, huh? Who'd want you as their master anyway?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, she got up to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But her movements were slow, clearly hoping Marcus would stop her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, if Marcus refused, she'd be forced to go overseas for training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go ahead and leave. I'll call your dad and tell him to send you abroad immediately," Marcus said with a teasing smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade stomped her foot, spun around, and pointed a finger at him. "You're such a jerk! Just wait. One day, when you're at my mercy, I'll make you pay for this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, she stormed out, slamming the door behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus chuckled to himself, unfazed, and headed to the bathroom to wash up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With his business in Solariae nearly complete, he planned to return to Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At Solariae, in a luxurious office of Rivera Construction Group, Mark Rivera, the chairman, sat behind his desk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His daughter, Emma Rivera, stood beside him. Their faces were gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Emma, your uncle has already been placed under investigation by Department of Justice. The source of the funds is clear, and they even have transaction records. There's no way to cover this up!" Mark said. His expression was dark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andre was Mark's younger brother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the secretary-general of the Solomia government, Andre had provided Rivera Construction Group with countless business opportunities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now that Andre was under investigation, their business would inevitably suffer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's all because of that guy, Marcus! If it weren't for him, my uncle wouldn't have been caught!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma gritted her teeth, still furious about what had happened at the bidding meeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Emma, according to my sources, Marcus has been in Solariae for the past few days," Mark said, his eyes narrowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Really?" Emma's eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course. I've been thinking about how to kill him. Otherwise, I won't be able to swallow this anger!" Mark growled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma quickly reminded, "Dad, that guy's all alone. Just hire someone from the underground to take him out. Let him see what happens when he messes with the Rivera family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mark had considered it before but hadn't acted on it yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Emma's words, he made up his mind. "I'll handle it now. Before he has a chance to escape again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Mark picked up his phone and made a call. "Hello, Tony? I need someone killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh, fifty million dollars? Fine, I'll transfer it to your account right away and send you his address."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After he hung up the phone, a satisfied smile appeared on his face. "It's done. Tony from the Black Tiger Gang will handle it personally. Marcus will die a horrible death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Emma immediately laughed, "I'll go with Tony. I want to witness Marcus' death myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While talking, she walked out of the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mark didn't stop her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his mind, Tony's involvement meant Marcus' death was guaranteed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Letting Emma witness it was a small way to help her vent her anger.</span></p><div class="pagination">
