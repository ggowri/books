        <h1>Chapter 38 The Spatial Ring</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus flashed a reassuring smile and said, "Don't worry, Mom and Dad. The people who helped us are from the Special Forces. They've already left."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He told a little white lie, knowing full well there were some things his adoptive parents weren't better off knowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melinda exclaimed, "There are still good people in this world. In a few days, Marcus, you should go to thank them properly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know, Mom. I'll take care of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This incident had served as a stark reminder: no matter how strong he became, his loved ones were his greatest vulnerability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If someone wanted to hurt him, they'd go after the people around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was more resolved than ever to protect those he cared about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus helped his parents leave the abandoned factory, his mind raced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after his departure, a figure with an air of elegance descended, her gaze sweeping over the lifeless bodies strewn across the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze finally settled on the ashes of Brandon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a meticulous examination, she murmured to herself with a mix of sorrow and resolve, "Brandon, I never imagined you'd fall to some young upstart. Despite our constant quarrels, you were still a member of the Astral Serpent Order. I won't let your death go unavenged!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words hanging in the air, the elegant figure darted about with nimble steps and, after a few swift leaps, vanished into the expanse of the sprawling mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer ease of her motion suggested a cultivation level well above Ancient Martial Stage Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, was unaware of her presence. He had too much to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus made sure his parents were safely sent to Solomia Hospital. He hired the best nurses to care for them, sparing no expense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he headed back to Serpent's Coil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There, he gave a direct order to Edgar, "Send our best men to guard the Cedars Villas. My parents will be staying there, and I want to know the second anything seems off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After this harsh lesson, Marcus was determined never to allow such a lapse to occur again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the second day, the news of Brandon's demise had rippled through Solomia, sending shockwaves that left countless in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Speculation ran rampant among the populace, everyone trying to piece together the cause behind Brandon's unexpected death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon was no ordinary individual; he stood as the mightiest figure in Solomia, commanding the reins of the illustrious Golden Group!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was common knowledge in Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, this formidable figure met his end in an abandoned factory on the east side of the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the aftermath at the site spoke volumes of a ferocious clash where hundreds of Brandon's men, equipped with heavy arms, had met their untimely demise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer scale of the battle suggested a small-scale armed conflict.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a while, rumors swirled through Solomia like wildfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon's death swiftly became the hot topic that spiced up many an after-dinner conversation across the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some folks whispered that Brandon had crossed paths with a formidable foreign mercenary group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were also murmurs that Brandon had turned against his sect, leading to his expulsion and subsequent demise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, no one suspected Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This speculation arose because, even though Marcus had ascended to the position of the new chairman, he was still perceived as lacking the might to go toe-to-toe with Brandon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the view of many, Marcus was expected to remain under Brandon's shadow for an extended period.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like fate had simply dealt Marcus a winning hand by removing his biggest rival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon's death allowed Marcus to seamlessly annex his 25% share of Golden Group, bringing the entire conglomerate under his control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as Marcus reached the peak of his professional career, disaster was brewing for the Winchester family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Felix had aligned himself with Brandon, he had taken out massive loans under Abigail's name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sum involved soared into the hundreds of millions of dollars!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After cashing out, Felix heartlessly funneled the funds into his personal account, showing no concern for the fate of the Winchester family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the repayment date had arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail was in a desperate situation. She couldn't come up with anything close to the amount owed. In a last-ditch effort to keep the wolves at bay, she turned to the black market for high-interest loans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a temporary fix, but the interest rates were astronomical. Within no time, Abigail found herself bankrupt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was she unable to repay the bank, but the loan sharks were now coming for their money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperate and out of options, she considered selling the Winchester Villa to settle the debts. But the villa was in Jane's name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then came the final blow: Felix was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Abigail, it felt like the sky had collapsed on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the loan sharks' attempts to collect the debt proved fruitless, Abigail was dragged into the seedy world of a nightclub to serve as a hostess. The life she lived from that point on was nothing short of hellish. Day after day, she endured humiliation and torture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Marcus remained unaware of these.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His days were filled with consolidating his power in Golden Group and honing his Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After his fierce battle with Brandon, he'd come to a harsh realization that personal strength was his only true safeguard in this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon had only been at Ancient Martial Stage Two, but he had nearly killed Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had been any stronger, Marcus wouldn't have stood a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, despite his rigorous practice, Marcus found himself stuck at a plateau. His cultivation had reached the primordial ascension stage of Stage One, but no matter how hard he trained, he couldn't find a breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, as he racked his brain for a solution, he remembered the ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timeless Warrior's Grimoire wasn't just a guide to ancient martial arts. It also contained records of various other practices, including wizards, vampires, orcs, preachers, and beastmasters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among those records was a description of the Spatial Ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Spatial Ring was a creation of wizards in Weston Land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ring could create multidimensional spaces to store items.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ring Brandon wore bore a striking resemblance to the one described in the scripture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting another second, Marcus retrieved the ring. Following the instructions in Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, he cut his index finger and let a drop of blood fall onto the surface of the ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blood instantly merged with the ring, disappearing as if absorbed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately following, a scarlet light flashed across the surface of the ring, vivid and fleeting!</span></p></div>
