  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus smiled, his voice light, "Aren't we friends? No need to thank me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But without you, those people would've really pushed me around."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera responded, the memory of Fiona's threatening demeanor making her uneasy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, a thought crossed her mind. Her face grew concerned. "Mr. Fitzgerald, is it true what you said about Fiona having genital warts?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus nodded, his expression turning serious. "Yeah, it's true. And it's bad. The warts are all over her pelvic area, and it's been left untreated for too long. If she doesn't do something soon, it could get much worse."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera shivered, her face paling at the grim reality of it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So... could I catch it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera voiced her worry, the memory of Maximilian's earlier touch at the karaoke bar haunting her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She hadn't been touched much, but the fear of catching something like Fiona had </span><span>was</span><span> unbearable. The thought made her feel utterly helpless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn't imagine enduring the shame, the pain, or the humiliation. Her life, she feared, would be ruined.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What exactly did Maximilian do to you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus asked, his brow furrowing as he looked at her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Was there something she hadn't told him?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well, he didn't do anything major... just some grabbing and pulling. He tried to take </span><span>it further, but I fought him off. He only managed to touch my shoulders and arms, nothing else."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera explained, her voice shaking with the memory.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Locked in that private room with Maximilian, Kiera's quiet demeanor had been tested.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But somehow, she'd found the courage to fight back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And that courage helped keep her innocent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking back, she was grateful for that moment of strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus chuckled, finding her concern almost amusing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Genital warts weren't spread so easily. A brush against someone's shoulder or arm wasn't enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Marcus fall silent, Kiera grew even more anxious. "Mr. Fitzgerald, why aren't you saying anything? Am I really at risk of getting infected?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she spoke, her eyes began to glisten with unshed tears.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Kiera's anxious expression, Marcus couldn't help but tease her a little.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's possible, but don't worry. I know how to make sure you don't get infected."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera's eyes immediately brightened, and she hurried to respond, her voice full of hope. "You can really help? Please, Mr. Fitzgerald, I'm begging you, help me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus smiled, his voice playful, "Of course. We'll get to your place, and I'll make sure you're safe."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, his gaze lingered on her for a moment, his thoughts wandering.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't help but notice how cute she was, and the memory of their previous interactions, especially when he'd treated her, filled his mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Marcus couldn't help but remember how, during Kiera's treatment, he had seen almost all of her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She seemed quiet and demure, but there was something captivating about her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her skin was smooth, soft&mdash;beautiful, though her plain clothes often concealed her true beauty.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If only she dressed up a little more, she'd rival any woman he knew&mdash;like Michelle or Yvonne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling his gaze, Kiera's face flushed. She awkwardly shifted in her seat, feeling the heat rise in her cheeks.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her thoughts briefly strayed to something more intimate, but she quickly pushed the idea aside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Still, the idea of avoiding the disease was enough for her to nod firmly. "Thank you so much, Mr. Fitzgerald. I really appreciate it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus gave her a reassuring smile and drove on, pulling up to Kiera's apartment building soon after.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera still lived in that old rental </span><span>apartment,</span><span> a place built in the '90s.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It looked pretty run-down, and there weren't many pieces of decent furniture in the room.</span></p><div class="pagination">
