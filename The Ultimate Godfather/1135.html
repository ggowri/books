  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, he could easily kill his former self with a casual attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, over the past 15 days, many strange events had occurred around the world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the world's barriers gradually weakened, more and more external experts crossed the Ice Wall and entered this world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Like Lemuria's Ophidian, they naturally came here with the intent to seize the world's resources.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They committed all sorts of atrocities, including arson, murder, and looting, plunging the entire world into chaos.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some local cultivators, including wizards, warriors, metahumans, and others, spontaneously formed alliances to resist the invaders.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They used their own strength to fight against the invaders' atrocities, engaging in major battles across multiple regions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the invaders were clearly stronger than the local cultivators.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a result, a large number of local cultivators perished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus naturally received this news. Just as he was preparing to join the alliance to fight the invaders, a message came from Acoton that Ryan was critically ill, and Marcus needed to go there to see Ryan one last time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ryan is Marcus's biological father.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was naturally necessary for Marcus to see him one last time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, he did not refuse and rushed to Acoton with Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an underground base somewhere in the icy plains, Roger said, "Alison, my father is critically ill. Bruce and Marcus will both be there. This time, I must kill them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alison squinted her bright blue eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus had slept with her, so she hated him deeply and wished he would die soon.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But whenever she thought of the scenes of them making love, Alison felt an inexplicable urge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The pleasure of sex was irresistible to her. She even wanted to experience it again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing that Marcus would come to Acoton, she couldn't help but feel a bit of anticipation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Roger Gellar, Marcus's skills have improved significantly. Recently, he has been making frequent moves and has consecutively defeated numerous experts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's said that even several experts from Lemuria were killed by him. Mr. Roger Gellar, you should be more cautious!" Alison reminded Roger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sneered, "If that's the case, then I want to fight him even more. I want to know how someone who has trained for less than a year became this strong."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, the usually low-key Bruce also arrived with his people at Ryan's residence in Acoton.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the most powerful person in the world, Ryan's residence is located in the most prime spot in Acoton.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though not bustling, the area boasts an excellent environment. Behind the residence lies a stretch of endless snow-capped mountains.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Beneath the snow-capped mountains, the grand and majestic residence is surrounded by lush green trees, with a river flowing through, blending perfectly with nature.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Due to Ryan's critical illness, the once peaceful residence suddenly saw many visitors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They are all globally renowned figures, including top-ranked billionaires and highly respected wizards, warriors, and metahumans.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The arrival of Marcus and Diana naturally drew a lot of attention.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They all knew that Ryan's third son had been missing since childhood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But they never expected him to show up here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is Ryan's third son. He's indeed handsome, inheriting the Godfather's excellent genes."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, but he didn't inherit the Godfather's skills. This time, when the Godfather chooses an heir, he probably won't be in the running."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course. Even if the Godfather wanted to choose him as the heir, Mr. Roger Gellar wouldn't agree. I guess a large-scale conflict is highly likely this time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many people started discussing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Bruce, Roger, and some of Ryan's core subordinates arrived, waiting outside Ryan's palace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bruce remained calm and silent. Roger looked at Marcus and said, "Marcus, although we've never met, the rivalry between us has never stopped. It's a miracle you've survived until now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus looked at Roger, his expression still calm. He replied, "Roger, I should thank you for your mercy. Otherwise, I wouldn't have lived this long. However, it's not so easy for you to kill me now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Roger let out a mocking sneer and said, "I never thought you'd be so confident. Do you really think that killing a few insignificant people qualifies you to compare yourself to me? Let me tell you the truth, with your strength, you're no match for me at all!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus ignored Roger and looked at Alison.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling his gaze, she couldn't help but tremble slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She seemed to recall their past intimacy. Her cheeks flushed slightly, and she became a bit shy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you doing well?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Alison was feeling nervous, Marcus's voice came through.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Roger squinted his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his impression, there was no connection between Alison and Marcus; she had even tried to kill Marcus twice.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, from their conversation, Roger seemed to sense something subtle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alison replied awkwardly, "I-I'm okay, I guess."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus withdrew his gaze and said no more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, a blond, blue-eyed old man walked out of Ryan's palace and said, "Mr. Fitzgerald, the Godfather requests your presence!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bruce and Roger couldn't help but frown.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Roger asked unhappily, "Why would my father summon Marcus alone? What about us?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The old man shook his head and replied, "I don't know, but the Godfather specifically requested to see Mr. Fitzgerald. You'd better wait patiently outside."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Bruce and Roger could only wait where they were.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Marcus followed the old man into Ryan's palace, Roger wished he could kill Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus, you finally came."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the palace, Ryan lay on the bed, looking extremely weak.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Compared to when he met Marcus six months ago, he had clearly aged a lot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Father."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus stepped forward and held Ryan's hand. He was deeply worried about Ryan too.</span></p><div class="pagination">
