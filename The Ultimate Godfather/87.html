  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie looked at Marcus with curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy this young man exuded was far beyond what one would expect from a corporate executive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Shelman, you've got it wrong," Marcus replied with a casual smile. "I'm not even an executive at Golden Group. In fact, you won't find my name anywhere in their records."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, Marcus had already transitioned the role of chairman of Golden Group to Michelle, making him technically no more than an outsider.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't wish to explain, Mr. Fitzgerald, that's fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie decided not to press further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She directed her team to clean up the aftermath, bringing this episode to a close, thanks to Marcus's overwhelming strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, a groundbreaking event was making waves in Solomia's medical circles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Kingston Hospital, a senior patient suffering from a terminal aortic blockage&mdash;a veritable death sentence&mdash;had been miraculously saved by a mysterious young man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was the patient revived, but they were completely cured of their heart condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a medical marvel was unprecedented across all of Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The identity of the mysterious savior, however, remained unknown, leaving the medical community buzzing with speculation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some renowned cardiac institutes even offered hefty rewards in hopes of recruiting the mysterious healer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their investigations led to a startling revelation: the young man in Kingston bore an uncanny resemblance to the one who had cured late-stage liver cancer at Solomia Hospital just two weeks prior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The possibility that these miracles were performed by the same person sent shockwaves across the field.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If true, this healer's abilities went beyond extraordinary: curing advanced cancer and reviving terminal heart patients alike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The comparison to legends of old seemed almost insufficient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in Kingston was desperate to uncover the true identity of this medical genius, but so far, no one had succeeded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't linger long at BioFusion Pharmaceuticals but returned directly to his hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The past few days of travel and turmoil had left him mentally drained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided it was time to rest and focus on cultivating the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire and practicing the Fireball and Lightning spells he had recently acquired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two days passed in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the aid of magical herbs, Marcus finally elevated the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire to Stage Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sudden humming filled his mind, accompanied by a rush of unfamiliar memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's face lit up with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each breakthrough in the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire not only enhanced his strength but also granted him a unique ability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he reached Stage One, he gained X-ray vision, which allowed him to see through obstacles and illusions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, eager with anticipation, he delved into the new memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, the ability was called Celestial Reversal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simply put, Celestial Reversal enabled him to reflect incoming attacks back at their source.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The concept reminded Marcus of a technique he'd read about in an old novel, where a character named Murdoch wielded a similar skill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The potential of this ability thrilled him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In combat, the element of surprise could turn the tide of a fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he encountered an attack he couldn't endure, Celestial Reversal could deflect it and potentially incapacitate his opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as Marcus absorbed the intricacies of the technique, he noted its limitations. Activating Celestial Reversal consumed vast amounts of Numinous Energy and placed significant strain on the user's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made the ability more suited as a trump card for life-threatening situations or to counterattack someone stronger than himself rather than a regular tactic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To test its capabilities, Marcus experimented with the ability and it worked exactly as the memory indicated&mdash;he could deflect any object.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it was also true that Celestial Reversal consumed a significant amount of Numinous Energy. Even simply deflecting a tennis ball took a certain amount of his Numinous Energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reflecting a more formidable attack would undoubtedly come at a severe cost to his vitality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aside from mastering this ability, Marcus also devoted the two days to honing the Fireball and Lightning spells.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using the Magic Codex he had, he progressed to an elementary level of proficiency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, Marcus had mastered the Fireball and Lightning to a degree where they possessed real power, no longer just party tricks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A single bolt of lightning could shatter a one-meter-wide stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such power was enough to pose a serious threat to someone at the Stage One of Ancient Martial Arts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was confident that with continued practice, these two techniques would become his second trump card, aside from the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the third day, as Marcus was just waking up, he received a call from Josie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, do you have time today? I... my cycle has ended..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
