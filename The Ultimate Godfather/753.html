        <h1>Chapter 752 Princess Nadia</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan's eyes sparkled with sudden interest, and she exclaimed in astonishment, "You can treat illnesses?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled, "Yeah."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan regarded Marcus with a hint of skepticism. "I can take you there, but our tribe is already equipped with medical practitioners. You should simply observe quietly from the sidelines. If you lack the confidence to assist in Nadia's treatment, refrain from disturbing the doctors," she advised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very well." Marcus nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan said, "Stay here for a few minutes. I'll return shortly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Susan exited the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In under two minutes, Susan went back, carrying a set of men's garments typical of </span><span>the tribe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Put these on. Otherwise, you'll look out of place," She instructed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus immediately complied, donning the clothes Susan had brought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This set of clothing bore a resemblance to the attire worn by men in the Middle Ages. While it wasn't the most comfortable to wear, he had no choice but to make do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Subsequently, Marcus followed Susan out of the room and was greeted by an entirely new underwater world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reefs, corals, fine sand, and an array of peculiar fish swimming about adorned the landscape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were also numerous underwater structures. Although not as large-scale as the previously dilapidated underwater city, the area they occupied was still extensive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they made their way along, Marcus and Susan encountered quite a few individuals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These people showed profound respect upon seeing Susan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Marcus noticed that the inhabitants here differed from those in the outside world. On their foreheads, each person had a growth resembling a horn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Presumably, as an outcome of evolution, these horns were rather small, with most of them concealed by their hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus observed closely and discovered that Susan, too, had such a horn on her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This indicated that the members of the Nuer Tribe might not be the same as humans in the traditional sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan led Marcus through the underwater architectural complex until they finally reached an exquisitely magnificent castle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A room within the castle was already filled with people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From their clothing and bearing, Marcus could discern that these individuals held positions of great importance within the tribe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An elderly man, crowned and clad in golden robes, stood at the bedside, his expression gravely solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon Susan's arrival, she immediately bowed to the older man, addressing him as Mr. Stewart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, did not offer a bow, which instantly drew the attention of many members of the Nuer Tribe present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man dressed in purple, sporting a silver crown, questioned Susan, "Susan, who is him? Why is he so disrespectful? He doesn't even pay his respects when he sees Mr. Stewart. Throw him out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, several tribesmen surrounded Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan swiftly stepped in front of Marcus and said to the man with the silver crown, "Dad, this man is a newly-acquired servant of mine. He's new here and is unfamiliar with the customs. Please forgive him, Mr. Stewart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan's father, Elliott, along with Raphael and others, cast another scrutinizing glance at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chief, Raphael Stewart, stated, "Susan, taking in a human as a servant goes against the rules of our tribe. Don't you understand that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, too, looked at Susan with a disapproving gaze, his eyes filled with reproach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan replied, "I'm aware of our rules, but Marcus claims to have a way to save Nadia, </span><span>so I brought him here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their brief acquaintance, Susan had somehow come to believe Marcus' words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strange illness affecting their tribe was congenital, and even the renowned doctors within the tribe were at a loss. Marcus might not have a solution either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with Marcus' sudden appearance in her room, she was truly unsure how to handle the situation, so she brought him here as he had requested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Susan finished speaking, Elliott thundered, "Susan, as a member of the Nuer Tribe and my daughter, you should know that our illness is incurable and can only be managed temporarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Furthermore, this human might have malicious intentions. You actually chose to trust him and bring him here. You've deeply disappointed me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Other members of the Nuer Tribe also looked at Susan with puzzled expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our tribe has been stationed in the underwater world of the Ice Wall in </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> for years, having no contact with the outside world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I suspect that this human who has suddenly infiltrated our tribe has ill intentions. I propose that we execute him immediately to eliminate any potential threats!" A high-ranking member of the Nuer Tribe suggested, his eyes fixed on Marcus with hostility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words immediately found resonance among the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the Nuer Tribe had established their residence in this underwater world, there had always been humans attempting to break in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them were many with ill motives, which had brought serious consequences to the Nuer Tribe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Consequently, the people of the Nuer Tribe were highly distrustful of humans who intruded from the outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before the Nuer Tribe members could take action against Marcus, a sweet girl on the bed let out a soft moan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A look of pain contorted her incredibly beautiful face. Her complexion was deathly pale, and she appeared weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Stewart, Princess Nadia seems to be in a critical condition..." An elderly man with a bushy beard informed Raphael.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raphael's face darkened, and he urgently asked, "Is there any other way?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beautiful girl lying on the bed, Nadia Stewart, was Raphael's daughter and the princess of the Nuer Tribe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had just turned 18 this year, at the prime of her youth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raphael had envisioned a bright future for her, perhaps even a return to that sacred continent, but he had never anticipated that his dreams would be shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia, like many in the Nuer Tribe, suffered from that strange disease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regrettably, Nadia's condition had been deteriorating steadily since last year, and now she was on the verge of death. Even the most skilled doctor in the tribe was helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've employed the most advanced treatment methods available in our tribe, but they've had no impact on Nadia's condition. I'm truly at my wit's end. I'm sorry, Mr. Stewart!" The elderly man with the beard said with grief and indignation. He was the </span><span>most proficient doctor here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had extensive experience in treating the tribe's strange illness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Nadia's illness was far more severe than that of others, and his medical skills could no longer keep the condition in check.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing the doctor's words, everyone showed his sorrow and indignation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia was not only beautiful but also kind-hearted and intelligent. The prospect of losing such a girl filled their hearts with profound sadness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can save her!"</span></p></div>
