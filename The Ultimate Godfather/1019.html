  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer force sent Yasser crashing into a nearby building, which crumbled upon impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes widened in sheer terror and despair as he coughed up blood in torrents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a single punch, Marcus had shattered his insides, organs, bones, and cells alike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brett's heart wrenched with anguish at the sight. His roar of fury echoed through the air. "Yasser! You killed my son! I will make you pay for this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Brett unleashed a torrent of destructive energy, attempting to crush Marcus beneath his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus didn't even flinch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, his hand clamped down on Brett's throat. A sickening snap rang out as Brett's neck was broken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brett's eyes bulged in shock and desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Never in his wildest dreams had he imagined dying like this, nor did he expect his son to meet the same fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the reality hit him. His death was inevitable, and the entire Tucker family would likely be wiped out in the aftermath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of regret flooded over Brett. It was too late to change anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cursed himself for ever urging Yasser to challenge Marcus in Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't, perhaps none of this would have happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was dead, and the rest of his family would follow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus casually discarded Brett's lifeless body and collected the Dragon's Wrath Formation in Spatial Ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could tell the Dragon's Wrath Formation had tremendous potential, but Brett had barely unlocked any of its power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus planned to study it later, figuring it could be useful in future battles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that both Brett and Yasser were dead, the remaining Tucker family members were paralyzed with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They lost the will to fight back and scrambled in all directions, desperate to escape Marcus' grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was already too late for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus flicked his hand, summoning a devastating burst of Thunderfire Power from the heavens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It rained down in a blazing inferno, engulfing the entire Tucker Estate in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within seconds, the once-proud Tucker family was obliterated, trapped in a storm of lightning and fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Screams and cries filled the air as the firestorm tore through them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Less than thirty minutes later, not a single Tucker family member was left standing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What had once been one of the most respected families in Uswad's Ancient Martial Art world had been wiped off the map.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One wrong decision had sealed their fate, erasing their centuries-old legacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus stood at the center of the devastation, his presence chilling and final, as if death itself had taken form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the brutal battles he had just fought, he stood untouched, his body pristine, unmarked by a single injury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie, standing a distance away, stared in disbelief, her face pale with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had thought Marcus was walking to his death when he entered the dungeon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't taken his threats seriously, especially the one about destroying the Tucker family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, she realized that everything he said was true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Marcus. When he spoke, he meant it. And he would never back down from fulfilling his promises.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' voice broke the heavy silence. "Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie snapped back to reality, her body trembling slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at him, her eyes filled with a flicker of fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could she not be scared of someone like him, a man who had effortlessly wiped out the entire Tucker family? Such power was something even the bravest would hesitate to challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could process her thoughts, Marcus took her hand and swept her off her feet, carrying her away at a swift pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only after they had disappeared did the shadows around the Tucker Estate begin to stir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Figures emerged, all from deep within the Kinton Mountains, members of other Ancient Martial Art families.</span></p><div class="pagination">
