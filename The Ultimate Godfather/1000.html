        <h1>Chapter 922 Satisfy Her</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was adorned with bright red decorations, reminiscent of an ancient bridal chamber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lavish ornaments exuded not only opulence but also a festive ambiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the center of the room stood a large, solid wooden bed, draped with red gauze curtains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint, refreshing fragrance lingered in the air, adding to the atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Marcus could fully process his surroundings, Ada began to gently massage his shoulders with her delicate hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her white gauze dress slid down her alluring figure, revealing her bare skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beneath the dress, she wore nothing else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her slender neck, alluring collarbone, and perfectly rounded breasts came into view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Below her flat stomach lay a dark, mysterious patch, partially concealed yet undeniably enticing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her long, shapely legs completed the picture, creating a striking visual impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was no wonder Ada was renowned as the most beautiful woman in the world of Ancient Martial Art.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This woman was not inferior to anyone else in terms of appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her flawless figure was like a masterpiece, every curve and contour meticulously crafted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a living work of art, breathtaking from every angle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was momentarily stunned by her boldness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but wonder what had come over her. She seemed like a completely different person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unbeknownst to him, Ada had been wrestling with her emotions during their time apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus," she whispered, her cheeks flushed, "I want you to love me. Will you fulfill my wish?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words struck a chord deep within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of heat rushed through his body, pooling in his lower abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sly smile played on his lips as he gazed at her perfect form. "How do you want me to satisfy you?" he asked, his voice low and teasing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada's eyes softened, and her voice trembled with a mix of desire and vulnerability, which further stimulated Marcus' inner desire to conquer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want you to take me. Please, make me yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice was soft and even had a hint of pleading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her plea sent a jolt of electricity through Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he pulled her into his arms and captured her lips in a passionate kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She responded eagerly, her body melting against his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes fluttered shut as she lost herself in the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Marcus kiss her eyelids.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' hands roamed freely, exploring her body with a mix of tenderness and urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As their kiss deepened, he felt her warmth and wetness, a clear sign of her arousal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't help but rub it in the mysterious part.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This caused the body of Ada to quickly enter a state, and her body trembled continuously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her breath hitched, and soft moans escaped her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus," she murmured between kisses, "I've missed you so much. Every night, I've thought of you. I need you... Please, don't hold back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words only fueled his desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She kneeled before him, her hands trembling as she undid his pants. Her delicate fingers wrapped around his hardened length, and she took him into her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus groaned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he felt as if he was electrocuted. Ada's hands stroked, and her tongue entwined around that huge part.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but close his eyes and enjoy it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada's enthusiasm was undeniable. She had clearly been longing for this moment, and her actions reflected her desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She kept sucking Marcus' huge part hard, causing him to almost lose it in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His training in the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire had endowed him with extraordinary stamina and control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, he might have succumbed to her ministrations far too quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Ada continued to do her job, Marcus' desire was aroused to the extreme.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to hold back any longer, Marcus lifted her onto the bed and positioned himself above her. His hands cupped her breasts as his lips trailed down her neck, eliciting gasps and shivers from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were abundant sensitive nerves there, causing Ada, who had already fallen into endless lust, to let out a high-pitched cry. She involuntarily stretched out her hands to hold the back of Marcus' head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body arched toward him, craving more. Of course, Marcus would satisfy Ada.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he was kissing her breasts, his big hands kept rubbing back and forth in her mysterious crevice, which was already wet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And by constantly touching the raised points, Ada quickly reached her first peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entrance in her lower body suddenly became flooded, and she gasped for breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus naturally couldn't help it, so he took off his upper body clothes and spread apart the white and slender legs of Ada. With a swift motion, he entered her, filling her completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, she felt the long-lost sense of fullness and only felt a faint tearing sensation coming from the hole of her lower body. Ada cried out, a mix of pleasure and relief washing over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made her face flush, and she looked at Marcus with surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could speak, Marcus began to move, each thrust sending waves of ecstasy through both of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was soon filled with the sounds of their passion, a symphony of moans and whispered declarations. Wrapped in a huge wave of happiness, she soon reached her second climax.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harder," Ada begged, her voice trembling. "I've waited so long for this. Don't stop."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada responded while making moaning sounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, she felt unprecedented happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially after Marcus' thing had become bigger, Ada felt a sense of comfort that she had never felt before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strong feeling of expansion made her unable to stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but spread her legs wide open, trying to let Marcus touch her sensitive organs deep inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the flushed face and lustful expression of Ada, Marcus' inner impulse was unstoppable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He began to thrust in and out frantically, with his movements becoming more and more vigorous as the power of Timeless Warrior's Grimoire and the Dual Cultivation power blossomed together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two were completely immersed in a huge wave of happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada felt her inner desires fully unleashed, the emptiness that had haunted her gradually being filled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This overwhelming sensation consumed her, making it impossible to resist. At night, when silence enveloped the world, her thoughts inevitably drifted back to these moments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were times when the longing became unbearable, and she would resort to her own hands to find relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While it brought her to a fleeting peak, it was never enough. Her hands could never replace Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The comfort, the excitement, the sheer intensity. None of it could compare to the times she had shared with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Worse still, the aftermath of such self-indulgence left her feeling even emptier than before. It was a vicious cycle&mdash;the more she sought satisfaction, the more her hunger grew.</span></p></div>
