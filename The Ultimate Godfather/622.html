        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't invite Albert to this party, and the reason was simple. When they were in college, Albert had pursued her for two years, but she never agreed to date him. Eventually, they had a falling out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To everyone's surprise, Albert showed up uninvited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the blonde-haired, blue-eyed Luna by Albert's side, neither Jade nor the other classmates knew her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they were in college, Albert was the class monitor and quite handsome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A</span><span> few years</span><span> a</span><span>fter graduation, Albert had shed his youthful immaturity and become even more mature and attractive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dressed in a crisp suit, he looked dashing, immediately catching the attention of many girls present. However, when they saw Albert with his arm around Luna's waist, they couldn't help but feel a little disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Long time no see, everyone!" Albert waved at the classmates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally fixed his eyes on Jade and smiled, "I heard from other classmates that it's your birthday today, so I came to join in the fun. You don't mind, do you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade looked a bit uneasy and shook her head. "Of course not. We're classmates."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since he had already come here, even though she didn't like Albert, she had to say something for the sake of politeness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today is also my girlfriend Luna's birthday, so we can celebrate together and make it more lively," Albert glanced at everyone and said loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was taken aback for a moment but immediately understood that Luna was the girl from Weston Land by Albert's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being in her twenties, this blonde-haired young woman with blue eyes looked very fashionable and beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This drew admiring glances from several male classmates towards Albert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A female classmate praised him. "Albert, your girlfriend is so pretty. She outshines all the other girls here. Did you do it on purpose?" By the end of her sentence, her tone had become teasing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people laughed, but to be honest, in terms of appearance, only Jade seemed to have the qualifications to compete with Luna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, Luna is from the McHale Pharmaceuticals Group, and her father is the executive president of it. Besides, Luna's family is also very prestigious with excellent genes, so that's why she's beautiful," Albert said with a hint of arrogance in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While saying that, he couldn't help but glance at Jade, trying not to miss the regret on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, he had pursued Jade for two years, but she had ruthlessly rejected him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her rejection made Albert harbor resentment and he vowed to find a girl even better than Jade. And now, he made it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, everything about Luna was much better than Jade, especially in terms of status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade was born into a medical family; her father, Robert, was the director of the Solariae Hospital's surgical department, and she was currently working at Solomia Hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally speaking, such a background would be outstanding enough among ordinary people, but those from wealthy families didn't give a damn about it. Compared to Luna, Jade's background seemed even more humble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert just wanted to show Jade and her classmates that even though Jade rejected him, he could still find a girlfriend a hundred times better than her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Albert's opinion, to show off Luna in front of them was very uplifting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As expected, after Albert finished speaking, many present began to exclaim in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>McHale Pharmaceuticals Group was a renowned large pharmaceutical group and a top three large multinational company in the pharmaceutical industry rankings, a true giant enterprise. At least in the field of pharmaceuticals, no domestic pharmaceutical group could compare to McHale Pharmaceuticals Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Luna's father was the executive president of McHale Pharmaceuticals Group. Considering her identity, she was superior to everyone present!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people cast admiring and envious glances at Albert and Luna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Albert, my man! Good for you to date such an excellent girlfriend like Luna. I even began to feel jealous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, Albert is really awesome. I don't even have a girlfriend yet, and he's almost become part of the family of the executive president of McHale Pharmaceuticals Group."</span><span> </span><span>Several male classmates commented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert greatly enjoyed this feeling of being admired, and his vanity was greatly satisfied. He couldn't help but say to everyone, "Actually, the reason I met Luna was not only because we were mutually attracted but also because Jade rejected me before. If she had agreed to be my girlfriend, I wouldn't have had the chance to meet the even better Luna."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert spoke in a sarcastic tone, emphasizing the word "better".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was obviously meant for Jade to hear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade took the hint of the sarcasm in his words and couldn't help but blush with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had a hunch from the beginning that Albert might come to cause trouble, but she didn't expect him to show his true colors so soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Albert and Luna took their seats.</span></p></div>
