        <h1>Chapter 583 Turning the Tide</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, under the astonished gazes of everyone, Rodney suddenly woke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes scanned the surroundings in confusion, and he muttered, "Am I... dead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uncle Rodney, you're not dead. Marcus saved you." Catherine quickly explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rodney's gaze turned to Marcus, and he suddenly looked at him with a grateful expression. "Young man, did you really save me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gina, still in disbelief, had witnessed Marcus' life-saving actions firsthand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nodded towards her </span><span>father,</span><span> her voice soft. "Dad, it really was Marcus who saved you. We were wrong about him..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of shame washed over Gina as she thought back to the harsh things she had said to Marcus earlier. She felt mortified, wishing she could disappear into the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her father come back to life under Marcus' hands, Gina's heart filled with gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Young man, I can't thank you enough. You're like a second father to me!" Rodney said, squeezing Marcus' hand tightly, his voice thick with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved his hand nonchalantly. "No need for thanks. If you want to thank anyone, thank Catherine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Truth be told, Marcus had no particular interest in Rodney or his family. If it weren't for Catherine, he would have just walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Catherine, before... I was wrong about you. I shouldn't have doubted you. Please don't be upset. I owe you an apology," Rodney said, his eyes focused on Catherine as he moved to bow deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine immediately stopped him, saying, "Uncle</span><span> </span><span>Rodney</span><span>, please don't. We're family. I couldn't just stand by and do nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gina looked at Catherine with an apologetic expression. "Catherine, I was too hasty before. I was just so worried about </span><span>Dad,</span><span> I said things I shouldn't have. I'm really sorry to both of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, Gina gave a deep bow to both Marcus and Catherine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible? How could Rodney's heart have stopped, and now he's suddenly alive again? This is... a miracle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Berg finally snapped out of his shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped forward to Marcus, and his face had shifted from disbelief to quiet respect. "I... I was out of line earlier. I hope you won't hold it against me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus simply waved him off. "We're just passing strangers. No need for all this. You're a doctor, and you didn't do anything wrong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Marcus turned his attention elsewhere, clearly uninterested in further conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Berg had hoped to use this opportunity to form some kind of connection with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, a healer with this kind of skill was rare&mdash;worldwide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But seeing Marcus' cold, indifferent attitude, Berg swallowed his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized it was his earlier mocking remarks that had put him in this position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd lost the chance to align himself with such a Master Healer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gina, Catherine</span><span> and</span><span> </span><span>Marcus </span><span>are</span><span> </span><span>my savior</span><span>s</span><span>. Tomorrow, when you start work, please check with the Sync Group's </span><span>Solomia</span><span> branch and see if they have any suitable openings for Catherine. If not, I'll have </span><span>her</span><span> </span><span>join our wellness company." Rodney said, turning to Gina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gina nodded confidently. "Dad, don't worry. This time, I won't let Catherine be left without a job. I'll make sure she's with me and help her grow. I'll even make sure she earns a six-figure salary, at least. That way, their family will have a good life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gina, really, you don't have to. I already have a job lined up. Marcus got me a position with an eight-figure salary. And we're probably going to be colleagues too!" Catherine laughed lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gina froze for a moment, then her face lit up. "Wait, you've already joined the Sync Group's </span><span>Solomia</span><span> branch? That's amazing! Now I can really take care of you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's not get carried away with the eight-figure talk. I'm your cousin, so it's fine to share with me, but if you tell others, they'll think you're exaggerating."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine didn't go into detail, but soon she would be starting work after her break, </span><span>and they would probably cross paths at the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' Timeless Numinous Energy had such powerful healing effects that, as his abilities grew, the results became even more incredible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rodney's aorta had been completely blocked, but after Marcus' treatment, his body had fully recovered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no need for further hospitalization&mdash;he was as good as new.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Marcus and Catherine completed the paperwork for her new house, they left the sales office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Dragon Crest One was a move-in-ready property, Marcus immediately arranged for a design company to start the renovations that same day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The design would be ready in three days, and construction could begin on the fourth day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The process would take about two months, and after a six-month formaldehyde release period, she could move in after about eight months.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this time, Catherine would have to stay in the staff housing building temporarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus helped Catherine drive her new Mini Cooper back to her building. By the time they arrived, it was already past 7 p.m.</span></p></div>
