  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Leah family could have easily eliminated all obstacles with Marcus's power and become the absolute ruler of the Kinton Mountains.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But it was their arrogance and outdated thinking that made them miss this golden opportunity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And such an opportunity seems to never come again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Afterward, ignoring the Leah family, Pedro led numerous Henderson family experts aboard the flying battleship and left Emotionless Gorge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their strengths were evenly matched.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Kyson is dead, and nine Grandmasters of the Leah family are injured. However, Pedro alone cannot defeat them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they continue to fight, they will only end up in a lose-lose situation, benefiting other families.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this situation, stopping the fight is the wisest choice.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, watching Pedro and the others leave, the Leah family did not stop them. The conflict ended there.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Trevor said, "Minerva, come here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Minerva asked, "What are your orders?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Trevor asked, "Tell me, how far has Gertie and Marcus's relationship progressed?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The others couldn't help but perk up their ears, equally eager to know the answer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In response to Trevor's question, Minerva dared not hide anything and answered truthfully, "They have already been intimate."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's wonderful. They're already so close. Truly a blessing for the Leah family!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Minerva finished speaking, Trevor burst into a fit of wild and joyful laughter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The nine Grandmasters of their family were usually extremely dignified and never smiled casually.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Trevor was clearly a bit out of control.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why are you laughing?" Minerva asked, somewhat puzzled by his meaning.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm happy that Gertie and he got involved."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Although he is unwilling to deal with the Leah family now, I believe over time, he will definitely help us for Gertie's sake."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He might even elevate the Leah family to become the top family in the Kinton Mountains!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Trevor's weathered eyes sparkled with anticipation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The others nodded along, thinking his words made some sense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Minerva immediately understood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She could see that Marcus truly cared for Gertie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, he wouldn't have killed Kyson for Gertie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As someone who had lived for centuries, Minerva had naturally heard of the legends about the world beyond the Ice Wall.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was the vastest land, hiding numerous top experts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Compared to the world within the Ice Wall, Lemuria's power was naturally stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet Marcus, for Gertie, didn't hesitate to kill Roderick's subordinate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was enough to prove how much he valued her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Listen, if you meet him again in the future, you must treat him with respect and show him the utmost regard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If anyone disrespects him, you don't need to report to me. You can enforce the Leah family's highest level of punishment and execute them," Trevor continued to instruct.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone squinted their eyes and nodded one after another.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They also realized the hidden opportunities of the Leah family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they could win Marcus's favor, the Leah family could rise in the Kinton Mountains.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus, thank you for saving me earlier."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus used teleport and took Gertie away from Emotionless Gorge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But they didn't go far and instead arrived at an open area outside the Leah Manor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie looked at Marcus with admiration.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Earlier, his battle to slay Kyson was absolutely breathtaking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was the strongest battle Gertie had ever seen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She truly began to admire Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He smiled and said, "You're my woman. No need to be so polite with me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Besides me, the entire Leah family also needs to thank you. Without you, the Leah family might have been destroyed by Kyson!" Gertie said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I only did it to save you. This has nothing to do with the Leah family. If it weren't for you, given what they've done to me, I would have killed them all long ago."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus continued, "Alright. You've just returned to the family, so you probably have other things to handle. I'll take my leave now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing him about to leave, Gertie suddenly felt a bit reluctant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, she didn't say much and just nodded gently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately after, Marcus quickly used teleport and disappeared from Gertie's sight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching his departing figure, she felt as if she had just woken from a long dream.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everything that happened in the dream felt so real. She seemed to want to continue this dream.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the other protagonist in the dream had already left her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After leaving Kinton Mountains, Marcus returned to Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For the next few days, he stayed in the villa to train.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the help of various pills and the cultivation resources he found in Rivers and Kyson's Spatial Rings, Marcus successfully advanced his cultivation to Acquired State Eight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, through Dual Cultivation with Diana, Jane, Pearl, and other women, he further enhanced his cultivation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Half a month later, Marcus's cultivation had reached Acquired State Nine, elevating his strength to a whole new level.</span></p><div class="pagination">
