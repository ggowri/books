  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus frowned. "Are you helping that Noah forcibly detain people?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>David admitted frankly, "You could interpret it that way. I hope you'll understand, sir. Our kindergarten can't bear the responsibility, so we have to temporarily keep you here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie couldn't believe it. David openly sided with Audrey who looked like a landlady, detaining them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just a kindergarten, not a police station. What right do you have to restrict our freedom?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>David seemed annoyed, her tone turning hostile. "I've explained this before. I hope you can cooperate, Ms. Shelman. If you insist on leaving, our kindergarten may have to use force."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, two security guards pulled out batons, looking eager to act, as if they'd jump at Marcus and Josie the moment they tried to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus let out a cold laugh and said to David, "Remember what you just said. Don't regret it later!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>David looked Marcus up and down, sneering. "That's not something you need to worry about, sir. But let me remind you, Noah isn't someone ordinary people can provoke. When he gets here, you might not have the chance to speak to me again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled dismissively. "Then let's wait and see!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to Josie, he said, "Ms. Shelman, since they won't let us leave, we'll just wait here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie had no choice but to nod, her delicate features showing traces of unwillingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within ten minutes, a convoy of Maybachs arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tall, broad-shouldered man stepped out of one of the cars, flanked by several men in black.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Audrey returned as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, that man hit me! You have to stand up for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tall man was none other than Noah, the man even the kindergarten feared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing at nearly six foot three, Noah was built like a tank, radiating an aura of sheer menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a stark contrast to his polite title.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From his appearance, Noah looked more like an enforcer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah's gaze landed on Marcus. Seeing that he was just a man in his early twenties, contempt flashed in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're the one who hit my wife?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded. "Yeah, I hit her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus so calm, Noah smirked. "I'm guessing you're not from around here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded. "Solomia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah looked satisfied. "Ah, I thought so. A nobody from out of town. If you were from Kingston, you wouldn't dare talk to me like this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, tell me&mdash;how are you planning to make amends for hitting my wife?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied, "Your wife deserved it. Why should I apologize?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Noah, this outsider doesn't understand the rules. He's so arrogant. Let us teach him a lesson!" said one of the men in black respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah waved his hand, signaling the man to hold off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Marcus and said, "I don't like to bully people with power. Since you're not from here, I'll give you a chance. Kneel and apologize to my wife now, and I'll pretend nothing happened."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the commotion attracted more onlookers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Noah arrive, the crowd looked at Marcus with pity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>David chimed in, "Noah is being so generous. You should take this chance now. If you anger him, not only will you pay the price, but our kindergarten will suffer too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up. If he wants me to kneel, let's see if he has what it takes," Marcus snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus directly shouted at David.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>David sneered mockingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't be bothered to deal with someone so stubborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was curious to see how this outsider would handle Noah's fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Interesting. Truly interesting," Noah said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Marcus stand his ground, Noah gave a cruel smile. "It's been a while since I've met someone as bold as you. Looks like I need to teach you a lesson, so you understand how the world works!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
