  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus seemed to notice Lila's discomfort and, smiling, said, "It's rare to have someone join in the fun. Cheers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he poured more red wine into his glass and raised it to toast Lila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila, still looking uneasy, raised her glass and drank the wine in one go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor beside them didn't dare make a sound, standing respectfully in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of slaps had landed, and Ross was left in a sorry state. His entire face was swollen and bruised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood seeped from his mouth and </span><span>nostrils,</span><span> his appearance almost unrecognizable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone had never seen someone endure such a form of torture like Marcus'.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a combination of both physical and psychological torment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After today's events, Ross would likely never act as arrogantly as he had before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't even glance at Ross. He checked the time on his watch, stood up, stretched lazily, and then turned to Lila. He said, "It's getting late, and there's nothing more to see here. Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila nodded gently, then linked her arm with Marcus' as they walked out of the banquet hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Farewell, Mr. Fitzgerald!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Alaric, along with Victor, hurriedly bowed and showed the utmost respect as Marcus left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed as though Ross had been stunned by the slaps, for even after Marcus departed, he continued to slap himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor shook his head slightly, frowning as he walked over. "Mr. Fitzgerald has already left. You can stop now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ross finally ceased slapping his face. His features were so swollen they had distorted beyond recognition, making it impossible to tell what he had looked like before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The unbearable torment, coupled with the fear deep in his heart, had left him weak. Ross collapsed onto the ground, fainting from the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Walsh, are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several bodyguards from the Walsh family rushed over to help Ross up and immediately called for an ambulance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other celebrities in the banquet hall still couldn't stop trembling in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of them had ever imagined that a post-awards banquet could escalate to such a horrifying scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ross had originally been the absolute center of attention at the event.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone had been focused on him, showing him the utmost respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of the hottest female stars had even tried to win his favor, competing to outshine one another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was no exaggeration to say that with just a word from Ross, any one of the women </span><span>present</span><span> would have done something beyond moral boundaries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, this entertainment industry king had now been reduced to such a pitiful state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was forced to bow and apologize publicly, slapping his own face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was tragic. So tragic!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had always revered Ross as if he were a god.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They believed that with a move, he could make the entire entertainment world tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now they were finally realizing what it meant that "there's always someone greater."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe's eyes flickered, and she lightly bit her red lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt so foolish thinking back to the things she had said to Lila and Marcus before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had nearly fallen out with Lila just because Lila refused to interact with Ross for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now she saw how wrong she had been! Her actions couldn't just be called foolish </span><span>anymore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this thought in mind, Chloe hurried outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the parking lot, she spotted Marcus' Aston Martin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Marcus and Lila were about to get into the car, Chloe hurried over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chloe, do you need something?" Lila asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I came to apologize to both of you," Chloe said, feeling a bit awkward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila smiled, "Chloe, we're best friends. I know you did it for my sake, so there's no need to apologize. If you really want to apologize, you should do it to Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe turned her gaze to Marcus and said, "Mr. Fitzgerald, I was wrong before, I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Chloe could finish, Marcus waved his hand and interrupted her, saying, "We're just strangers who crossed paths. There's no right or wrong here, and there's no need for you to apologize. Whether we meet again in the future is uncertain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Marcus got into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila gave Chloe a nod and then sat in the passenger seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The engine roared to life as the V8 engine howled, and the car sped out of the Golden Hotel parking lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe stood frozen, her face blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Marcus had said was true. They were mere strangers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether they would meet again in the future was uncertain, and it was perfectly normal for him not to accept her apology.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, with Marcus' status, how could someone like her, a small-time star, even matter to him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus drove his Aston Martin through the streets of </span><span>Solomia</span><span> at night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With one hand on the wheel, his other </span><span>hand held</span><span> Lila's delicate hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila shivered slightly, seemingly aware of what might happen next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She spoke softly, "Mr. Fitzgerald, could you send me home? I'm a little afraid of the dark."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded at Lila and steered the car towards Urban Apartments.</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
