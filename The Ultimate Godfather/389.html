  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Catherine, is it hot in the car? Why is your face so red?" Marcus asked casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catherine immediately shook her head. "No, I'm not hot. It's quite cool tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then why is your face so red?" Marcus suddenly felt a little worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm just nervous... Mr. Fitzgerald, don't worry about me. Just focus on driving. I'll be fine later." Catherine lowered her head, her breathing becoming a little short.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus held Catherine's hand while driving. "We have made love. Why are you still so shy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, please don't say that. It's really embarrassing!" Catherine tried to cover Marcus' mouth. Just as she leaned forward, Marcus quickly pecked her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catherine exclaimed with a blushed face, "Mr. Fitzgerald, how could you do this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't you like it? When we were in the car that day, you didn't seem to want me to stop," Marcus teased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus was very confident. He was potent, and every woman who had made love with him was very satisfied. He had good skills in bed and could give whatever women wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though it was Catherine's first time, she still often missed that pleasure. But Marcus said it bluntly. Catherine blushed, feeling very shy to look at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Marcus was teasing Catherine, a truck hit Marcus' car. Marcus was distracted, but his car moved straight ahead, and the truck turned left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The truck driver was probably in a hurry. He ran a yellow light and happened to hit Marcus' car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus sighed. This Aston Martin was the new car that Oliver had just given him as compensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, it's my fault. I distracted you." Catherine looked guilty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus shook his head. "That truck ran the yellow light. It's not your fault."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A young couple got out of the truck. Judging from their appearance and clothes, they were ordinary workers. They were shocked to see that he had crashed into such a luxurious car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man looked guilty, while the woman's eyes were red with anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man said with a worried look, "Sir, I'm sorry. I just received an order to transport goods. It was about to exceed the time limit, so I ran a yellow light. I'm so sorry for scratching your car. How much is the repair charge? I'll try my best to compensate you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The woman burst into tears. "Do you have money to pay for it? I told you to drive slower, but you didn't listen to me. Now you've hit this luxurious car. What should we do now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man looked regretful, but he gritted his teeth and said, "We have to compensate for this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The woman collapsed. She cried as she spoke, "We can barely raise the medical expenses for our son. How can we afford to pay for it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I just wanted to make more money. Oh, damn it!" The man was regretful. He even slapped himself when he said this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus and Catherine looked at each other. He stepped forward and said, "You don't have to pay for the repair charge. I can repair my car. It is insured."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When the young couple heard this, they were surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man said gratefully, "Sir, thank you very much. You are such a kind person, but I hit your car, and I should pay for it. You don't have to pity me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The woman winked at the man. Marcus had said that he didn't need them to pay compensation, and she thought it was the best result. After all, her family didn't live a wealthy life, and her only son suffered from a rare disease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her son had been living in the hospital for three years, and she had to pay a high medical fee every month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The woman didn't want to pass the buck, but with her condition, she didn't have enough money to pay for the high repair charge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus waved at the man. "You don't have to be responsible for it. Go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus glanced at the scratch on the car and estimated that the repair charge would be at least 200 thousand dollars, which was unaffordable for the young couple, who were less wealthy. Marcus didn't want to make things difficult for them. After all, 200 thousand dollars was just pocket money for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The young couple thanked Marcus and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at the time, it was almost time for the party. Marcus parked the car in a parking space on the roadside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He left the keys in the driver's seat and called the local service shop, asking the service personnel to drive the car back for repair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After that, Marcus and Catherine took a taxi to Kirkland Hotel. Fortunately, the traffic was not heavy. They arrived at the parking lot of the Kirkland Hotel at just 5:40 p.m.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When they got out of the taxi, a woman's voice was heard behind them. "Catherine?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
