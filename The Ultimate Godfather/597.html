  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was no different from robbery. Tim's conditions were totally unfair clauses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing Tim's words, Darian, Ramona, Kiera, and other managers of Darian Logistics Company all got angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if I don't agree?" Marcus asked with a sneer, his eyes full of chill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just after Marcus finished speaking, Gary walked up to him and said, "Do you think you have any room to disagree? Aren't you afraid that I will let someone kill you right now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While speaking, Gary actually reached out and wanted to slap Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus narrowed his eyes and kicked Gary in the abdomen. With a thud, Gary screamed and fell nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this scene, everyone was stunned. They never expected that Marcus would dare to attack Gary in front of Tim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim came here well-prepared. There were several plainclothes policemen next to him in case of emergency. They hid their identities and hadn't taken action yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus noticed that these men had a pistol on their waists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary was sweating profusely from the pain. He clenched his teeth as he roared at Marcus, "How dare you hit me? Mr. Burton is still here. You are courting death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary looked at Tim. "Mr. Burton, please help me teach this bastard a lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim's face darkened. Marcus' action was simply a challenge to him. Tim said to Marcus with a cold face, "I heard that you are good at fighting, so I prepared a big gift for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Tim waved his hand. The next second, the plainclothes policemen behind him pulled out their pistols and pointed them at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene frightened many people from Darian Logistics Company. Most of them saw a gun for the first time, so they were really afraid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary yelled at Marcus, "Jerk, you were so arrogant just now. Dare you to challenge Mr. Burton again? You are trained, but can you be faster than a bullet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this scene, Gary glared at Marcus with a smug look. He felt that Tim had really avenged him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darian, Ramona, and Kiera all looked furious. They had guessed that Tim could not have only brought some officers from the Industrial and Commercial Administration. But they never expected that Tim had even brought some plainclothes policemen. The situation became a little tough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim stood there with his hands in his pockets, looking smug. "You dared beat Gary in front of me just now. Even if I ask someone to shoot you, no one dares to stop me. Do you believe it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Tim spoke, he walked up to Marcus with an arrogant look and said, "I will count to three. Kneel and apologize to me. If you agree to the three conditions, I will spare you, or I'll blow your brains out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, Tim actually started counting the time. "One! Two! Three!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Tim counted to three, Marcus punched him in the face. Tim was knocked to the ground, and his teeth were broken. Blood was constantly gushing out of his mouth, looking very miserable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene once again stunned everyone. No one expected Marcus to be so bold that he dared to attack Tim even when many pistols pointed at him. They all thought Marcus was courting death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim wailed in pain, wiped the blood from his lips, and yelled at Marcus, "You are so fucking bold. You actually dared to punch me!" Then, he ordered the plainclothes policemen, "Just do it! Kill this bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the order, these policemen prepared to shoot Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, suddenly lifted Tim from the ground, clutched&nbsp;Tim's neck, and said to him, "Believe it or not, I guarantee that you will be dead before they shoot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim's face turned pale when he heard this. He dared not try. If Marcus were serious, he would lose his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim winked at one of the policemen. The policeman immediately understood what Tim meant. He walked aside and called Dustin Lloyd, the captain of the Solomia Police Department.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The policeman asked for support. It would be best if a few snipers could be sent over to kill Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Dustin heard that it was</span><span> about</span><span> Tim, he agreed immediately. Even the director of the police department had a close relationship with Tim's father, so Dustin would naturally help Tim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim warned, "You will be doomed. I will send you to hell. Remember what I said, and when you are dying, you will know who the winner is." Even though Marcus clenched Tim's neck, Tim was arrogant.</span></p><div class="pagination">
