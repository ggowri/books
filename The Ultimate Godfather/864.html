  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent as everyone's eyes instinctively turned to Marcus. Yet, no one immediately connected him to Death. Most people assumed it was just a coincidence. </span><span>The phone rang for a long time without being answered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finley's face darkened slightly as he muttered, "Mr. Death is probably busy. I'll try again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Completely unaware of what was happening, he hung up&mdash;and at that exact moment, Marcus' phone stopped ringing too. Without giving it a second thought, Finley redialed. This time, as soon as he did, Marcus' phone rang once more. Several people took notice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden's expression turned icy as he sneered at Marcus, "You're a fucking lunatic. You've really gone all out to impersonate Mr. Death, huh? What, you've been manually adjusting your ringtone this whole time? When my dad called, you made your phone ring on purpose to make it look like you were Mr. Death, didn't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His accusation made many in the room nod in agreement, casting even more mocking glances at Marcus. Only Jade remained skeptical. She had been right next to Marcus the entire time and never saw him touch his phone. Her face showed clear surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up! He answered!" Finley hurriedly hushed Aiden, not wanting to offend Death with any reckless words. Aiden immediately fell silent, waiting for Finley to speak with the mysterious figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, is this Mr. Death? Mr. Death, why aren't you speaking? Is the signal bad?" Finley's voice was filled with respect and caution. The once untouchable president of </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span> now sounded no better than a lowly errand boy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, no matter how he spoke, the other end of the line remained silent. Aiden instinctively took the phone from Finley, also speaking in a reverent tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was when Marcus calmly switched his phone to speaker mode and turned the volume all the way up. Suddenly, Aiden's words echoed through the room&mdash;from Marcus' phone. The realization sent a ripple of shock through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone cut in, "Wait a minute&mdash;Aiden is talking, but that guy's phone is playing his voice. What the hell is going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone asked, "Yeah, this doesn't make any sense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone echoed, "What do you mean it doesn't make sense? Finley called Mr. Death's number, and this guy's phone rang. Now the call is connected, and his phone is playing the conversation. It's obvious&mdash;he is Mr. Death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whispers filled the room, but when those final words were spoken, a stunned silence took over. Especially for Finley, Aiden, and Ronald. Their faces drained of all color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden's gaze locked onto Marcus, his voice trembling. "Why... Why do you have Mr. Death's phone? What's going on? Wait, you must be some kind of hacker. Yeah, that's it. Some hackers can reroute calls. You must've transferred my dad's call to your phone, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that no matter what, Aiden refused to believe Marcus had anything to do with Death. After all, in his mind, Marcus was nothing more than a backwater nobody. He thought, "How can he possibly be the legendary Mr. Death, the business genius who dominates </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> financial world?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even Aiden seemed to realize how absurd his own theory sounded. He thought bitterly, "Even if Marcus is some kind of hacker, how could he have rerouted the call in real-time without a trace?" No matter how you looked at it, Aiden was just grasping </span><span>at straws.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus let out a cold chuckle. "I seriously don't understand how people as stupid as you exist. Like father, like son&mdash;both equally brainless. If </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span> stays under your control, it's only a matter of time before it goes bankrupt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Marcus dialed a number&mdash;the </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span> board of directors. As the sole owner of 100% of </span><span>MedicaGenix's</span><span> shares, he had absolute authority over the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he gave a direct order as chairman. "Effective immediately, Finley is removed from his position as president."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Finley or Aiden could even react, Finley's phone began ringing. It was a call from the board of directors. Hurriedly, Finley answered, his tone as respectful as ever, "This is Finley. What can I do for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold voice came through the line. "On behalf of the </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span> board, I'm formally notifying you that you've been removed from your position as president. You may come in tomorrow to settle your remaining salary. As of today, you no longer have any ties to </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finley felt as if he'd been struck by lightning. His entire body </span><span>trembled,</span><span> his eyes filled with disbelief. "I've worked at </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span> for over twenty years! I am </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span>! You can't just fire me like this! This isn't how things are done!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The board representative replied politely yet firmly, "I apologize, but this was Mr. Death's decision. The board regrets this outcome, but Mr. Death owns 100% of </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span>. His decisions are final. Even if we wanted to keep you, we have no power to do so. We appreciate your service."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words were polite, but to Finley, they might as well have been a death sentence. His vision swam. He nearly collapsed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden rushed to steady him. "Dad! What's wrong? What did they say? They must've confirmed that this guy is a fraud, right?" Until now, Aiden still refused to believe that Marcus was Death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Aiden could finish, Finley swung his palm hard across Aiden's face. The impact sent Aiden stumbling, his cheek swelling instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You idiot! Do you still not get it? If it weren't for you, I never would've offended Mr. Death! You're a fucking curse to this family! From now on, I have no son!" Finley's rage exploded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because now, there was no denying it&mdash;the unassuming young man before him was the real Death. The same man who had purchased </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span> in full just yesterday for 150 billion </span><span>Uswadian</span><span> coins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As </span><span>MedicaGenix's</span><span> president, Finley had insulted Death, bringing an army of security guards with guns to threaten him. It was suicide. Thinking back, Finley wanted to strangle Aiden with his bare hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden clutched his stinging face. "Dad, I didn't... I mean, how could I have made you offend Mr. Death? This has to be a mistake."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finley's foot struck Aiden's stomach, sending him crashing to the floor, groaning in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Open your damn eyes and look! This is Mr. Death! And thanks to your stupidity, you dragged me into this mess too! I should just kill you right now!" His fury was </span><span>uncontrollable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he thought back to how furious he had been upon hearing that Aiden had been beaten, a wave of regret surged through him. He regretted spoiling Aiden so much. In the end, it led to this catastrophe.</span></p><div class="pagination">
