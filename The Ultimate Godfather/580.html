        <h1>Chapter 579 Penthouse Dreams and Doubts</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rodney let out a dry chuckle, his skepticism clear as day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gina turned her sharp gaze toward Marcus, sizing him up with thinly veiled contempt. </span><span>"Catherine, so you've got yourself a boyfriend now? And you didn't tell me? I could've helped vet him for you! Guys like him? They're a dime a dozen these days&mdash;full of empty promises. Are you seriously trying to tell me he got you a ten-million-dollar job? Come on, Catherine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words carried a heavy dose of sarcasm, practically daring Marcus to prove her wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Gina, it was laughable&mdash;her younger cousin spinning fairy tales to make her life sound more glamorous than it was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry about it, Gina," Catherine replied, her tone soft but resolute. "Marcus treats me wonderfully. In fact, this house is his gift to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled warmly, unfazed by Gina's jabs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rodney and Gina exchanged a quick look, their shared amusement evident in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So," Gina asked, her tone as sharp as her gaze, "which house did you pick?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rodney had chosen Dragon Crest One for Gina specifically because of its proximity to the Sync Group's </span><span>Solomia</span><span> office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd already paid for the smallest unit available&mdash;a modest 200-square-meter apartment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The location wasn't ideal, and the floor left much to be desired, but at </span><span>15</span><span> million dollars, it was still a significant expense for their family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If not for Gina's relentless persuasion, Rodney wouldn't have spent more than five million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine instinctively pointed to the penthouse, perched like a crown jewel in the heart of the community. "That one. Marcus says it's the best unit in the complex. You can see nearly all of </span><span>Solomia</span><span> from there. My parents have spent their lives in a cramped factory apartment. I want them to finally enjoy some comfort."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words hung in the air, drawing stunned silence before Rodney and Gina both broke into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Catherine," Gina said, wiping an imaginary tear, "I agree&mdash;it's a fantastic unit. But have you seen the price tag? I just asked. That penthouse is 30 million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad's buying me the smallest place here, and even that's 15 million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be real, Catherine. Your family's situation? We all know it. Who in your house has 30 million dollars lying around?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rodney joined in, shaking his head. "You're too much like your father. All dreams, no reality. When I started my business, I wanted to bring him on board, but no&mdash;he was too busy drinking and gambling. Now look at him&mdash;pushing fifty and still spinning his wheels. And your poor mother's the one paying the price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Catherine don't end up like him. Be realistic. If Gina settles in at Sync Group, maybe she can get you a job there. It might not pay as much as hers, but at least it's stable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine smiled again, seemingly unbothered by their remarks. "You're right&mdash;I don't have that kind of money. Marcus is the one paying for it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rodney and Gina's laughter stopped abruptly, replaced by matching expressions of disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Him?" Rodney asked, pointing at Marcus. "Where's he getting that kind of cash?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, calm as ever, pulled a sleek card from his pocket and handed it to the sales associate. "Please process the payment," he said with a polite nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please wait a second, sir."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The associate smiled professionally and walked off toward the payment desk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, the clear chime of a successful transaction echoed through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rodney and Gina's jaws dropped in </span><span>unison,</span><span> their disbelief palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thirty million dollars&mdash;paid in full.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turns out, this young man wasn't as ordinary as he seemed at first glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Gina's sharp eyes zeroed in on his card, and a knowing smirk tugged at her lips. "That's a credit card," she thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, the 30 million dollars? Probably maxed out on credit," she concluded, her tone internally dripping with amusement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gina, who'd have guessed this guy had such deep pockets?" Rodney said, throwing her a glance filled with mock surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad," she said quietly, "that's a credit card. The 30 million dollars? It's borrowed money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, a small flicker of intrigue lit up Gina's mind. What kind of guy walks around with a credit card limit that high?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What neither of them realized was that Marcus' card wasn't a credit card at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a Supreme Card issued by a state-owned bank, reserved exclusively for accounts with deposits exceeding 100 billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had it because of over 100 billion dollars in his account.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The card's design resembled a credit card, leading to Gina's misjudgment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A credit card, I see. Kids these days are living like kings on borrowed money. Sure, it feels great now, but let's see how he feels when the bill comes due."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rodney sighed dramatically, shaking his head in faux pity.</span></p></div>
