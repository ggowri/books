  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Selena let out a sharp laugh after hearing Marcus' words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She folded her arms as she sized up him with pure disdain and sneered, "Let me guess, you're Chloe's little errand boy? Her assistant, maybe?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God, just look at you. Straight out of some nowhere town, aren't you? And let me take another wild guess&mdash;you two are together, huh?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow. Chloe really isn't picky, is she? She'll take anything that comes her way. And yet, she actually has the audacity to look down on me or Mr. Donovan?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please. Compared to Mr. Donovan, you don't even register.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's this, then? You stepping in like some kind of hero? Seriously? Take a look in the mirror. You think this is some fairy tale?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're nothing, and you know it. Mr. Donovan could crush you with one phone call. But hey, I'll give you a way out&mdash;if you get on your knees, apologize to him, and personally hand Chloe over, maybe he'll be generous. If not... Let's just say your night's about to get real ugly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrogance in her voice was impossible to miss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One look at Marcus, and she had already decided who he was&mdash;what he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And, truthfully, most of the room silently agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not because they judged a book by its covers, but because Selena wasn't wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it was obvious&mdash;Marcus wasn't anyone important, just another fool running on blind courage, thinking he could play the hero.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if that's what he wanted, he had picked the worst place for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the Luminara Awards, hosted by Royal Entertainment. And Miles wasn't just some executive&mdash;he was the executive vice president.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Going up against someone like him? That was a death sentence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So even though plenty of people despised Miles, they had to admit&mdash;Marcus was completely outmatched. For Marcus, the night could only end one way&mdash;badly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't even acknowledge Selena's words. His gaze stayed locked on Miles as he asked, his voice steady, almost indifferent, "So, you're admitting to abusing your power? Sleeping around to get your way?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miles froze for a split second. In a setting like this, openly admitting to something like that was out of the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then he took a good look at Marcus&mdash;just some nobody, a complete waste of his time. His guard dropped, a smirk creeping onto his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he let out a low, amused chuckle. "And if I was? What's it to you? What, you think some nobody like you gets to question me? Let me make something really clear. I could end you right now, and not a single person in this room would stop me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh?" Marcus sneered. Not in fear&mdash;if anything, he looked entertained. His tone was light, amused. "Now that's something I'd love to see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hush fell over the crowd. No one had expected this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A complete nobody, standing toe-to-toe with Miles? The sheer audacity was almost unbelievable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Selena scoffed, rolling her eyes, "Mr. Donovan, why waste your time? If he wants to play the hero, let's see how that works out for him. Deal with him now&mdash;show him what happens when someone crosses you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sounded almost eager, clearly looking forward to seeing Marcus put in his place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're absolutely right. It's about time this idiot learned his lesson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miles' smirk deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With an almost lazy wave of his hand, he turned to his security team. "Take care of him. Make sure he feels it. And don't hold back. If he doesn't walk out of here on his own two feet, that's his problem."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words dripped with arrogance, a blatant show of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miles knew no one here would dare intervene. He was executive vice president of Royal Entertainment. As far as he was concerned, he could do whatever he damn well pleased, and there wasn't a single person in this industry who could stop him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A ripple of unease passed through the crowd. People exchanged nervous glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had no doubt about what was coming. Blood was about to be spilled. And Marcus was about to become the latest casualty in Chloe's fight against Miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe's breath caught. Her gaze darted to Marcus, panic flashing in her eyes. She stepped forward, her voice tense, pleading. "Miles! This is between you and me! Leave him out of it!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
