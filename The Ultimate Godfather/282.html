  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A man's voice came through the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Emma, why did you suddenly call?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Uncle Andre, I'm in a bit of a pickle in the bid meeting for Bayside Amusement Park in Solomia. Can you swing by and give me a hand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why didn't you tell me you came to Solomia? Your dad did mention he wanted this project. Don't worry, I will be there right away. This project can only go to Rivera Construction Group!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andre was the secretary-general of the Municipal Government in Solomia with great power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma had always been confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if she was suppressed by Golden Group, she didn't panic at all, not only because she was the daughter of the president of Rivera Construction Group but mainly because of Andre.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing the conversation between Emma and Andre, the people of Rivera Construction Group were relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They naturally knew who Emma's uncle was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once Andre arrived, he would settle this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, the auditor reviewed all the bidding manuscripts of Golden Group and Rivera Construction Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Through scoring and other methods, they finally decided that Golden Group won the bid!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the host announced the results on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melina looked happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though it might have nothing to do with her, she didn't want Rivera Construction Group to win the bid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How dare you let Golden Group win the bid?" someone said from the doorway of the bidding meeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many people were stunned and looked in the direction of the voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They saw Andre come with the staff of the municipal government in a hurry. They looked dominating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing the arrival of the Secretary-General of the municipal government, all the auditors got up from their seats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They all came forward to meet, dare not have the slightest neglect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Rivera, Golden Group's winning is the result of our audit team's multi-party evaluation and inspection. Is there anything wrong with it?" the audit team leader asked Andre.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andre looked gloomy. "Golden Group is a diversified company, and its construction company does not have the experience of building large-scale amusement parks, so I think Rivera Construction should undertake the construction."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andre was denigrating Golden Group by saying this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Golden Construction had been established for more than twenty years. It had developed many large communities in Solomia and even participated in the construction of government buildings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It enjoyed a good reputation for quality and had high sales.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was easy for it to build a large playground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Rivera, we just announced the result of the bid. I'm afraid it's a little inappropriate to change it now," the audit team leader said with difficulty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't you even listen to me, the secretary-general? "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andre looked gloomy and pressured him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Bayside Amusement Park Project was dominated by the Municipal Government in Solomia. As the secretary-general of the municipal government, Andre did have certain ruling power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The leader of the audit team dared not speak, but he was somewhat unconvinced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, through their review and inspection, they believed that Golden Group was more suitable for winning the bid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, Andre got involved and tried to change the result, so they were helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The superior had the power to crush you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The hostess went on stage and re-announced the results, "Sorry, everyone, the previously announced results are invalid. I will announce again that Rivera Construction won the bid for the Bayside Amusement Park Project!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>People were so shocked to hear this but they could only sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No wonder people yearned for power in Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sometimes, power was more useful than money, and it could even turn the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma looked proud and greeted Andre at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The rest of the people in Rivera Construction Group were extremely proud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Golden Group was too overreaching to fight them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>People from Golden Group looked gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone said with unwillingness, "We won the bid. Now you are changing the results? How can you be so unfair? We want justice!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The bidding is held by the Solomia government. Are you bold enough to question the government?" Someone from Rivera Construction yelled back and his words sounded ironic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I can't believe that Solomia is darker than Kingston," Melina said to Marcus in depression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus smiled, "I can be darker than them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melina was taken aback. She had no idea what Marcus was implying.</span></p><div class="pagination">
