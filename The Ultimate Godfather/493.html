  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Kyle and Penny looked at Marcus with skepticism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle said, "I didn't think you'd stoop this low, trying to deceive us with a fake app. For someone your age, you are quite unrealistic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Penny sneered, "Shannon, this is the boyfriend you chose? Using a bogus app to fool people? I was wondering how he could possibly have that much money. Honestly, it's shameless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy said, "Your little tricks are laughably easy to see through. Leave Shannon now, or I won't go easy on you!" His disdain for Marcus was palpable, and even Shannon's image in his mind began to tarnish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon glanced at Marcus, her eyes questioning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Marcus sneered, "Which of your eyes saw that my app is fake? How utterly ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy shot back, "If it's not fake, there's no way you could have that kind of money. Your education, job, and background define your limits. I've seen people like you too many times to count."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That just shows how narrow your vision is," Marcus retorted, his tone biting. "How about this? I bet you already have this app on your phone. Why don't you log into my account and see for yourself? That should clear everything up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle, Penny, and Shannon all nodded at Marcus' proposal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy smirked. "Sure, let's see how long you can keep up this act. Just log in here and don't try any funny business!" He opened the payment app on his phone, logged out of his account, and handed the phone to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus logged into his account in front of everyone. Less than a minute later, the screen displayed the same staggering balance of 65.3 billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight left Jeremy speechless. He stared at Marcus, utterly dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you really have 65.3 billion dollars?" Jeremy stammered, his voice trembling. "Where did you get that kind of money? It must be stolen or swindled. There's no way someone like you could have so much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy's disbelief was palpable. He couldn't accept that someone with less education, no status, and no job could be wealthier than him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle and Penny nodded slightly, finding Jeremy's reasoning plausible. As seasoned business people, they understood how hard it was to amass wealth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crossing the ten-million-dollar mark was a significant milestone for most entrepreneurs, and breaking into hundreds of millions seemed almost unattainable. But 65.3 billion dollars was astronomical, enough to place Marcus in the top 100 on Solomia's rich list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet neither Kyle nor Penny had ever heard of such a figure in their business circles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Shannon felt her doubts vanish. The sheer size of Marcus' balance left her equally astounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sneered, "There is no point in arguing. Do you admit now that my money is real?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy gritted his teeth, reluctant but forced to nod. "Fine, your account is real. But there's no way that money is clean. So there is nothing worth bragging about."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled, "That's none of your concern. Now, let's get back to the bet. I showed you my 50 billion dollars, just as you demanded. That means it's time for you to honor your word. Go ahead and kiss my boots."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy's face darkened, his rage boiling over. "It was just a joke! And you actually took it seriously? You're out of your mind if you think I'm going to kiss your boots!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle couldn't help but glare at Marcus. "You really can't take a joke, can you? Shows how small-minded you are. Shannon, even if he has money, I wouldn't recommend you stay with him. Jeremy comes from a respectable, scholarly family. Your future children would benefit from a much better upbringing in that environment. I sincerely hope you'll think this through."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Marcus completely ignored Kyle and Jeremy's words. He stood up and walked toward Jeremy. He grabbed Jeremy by the collar, yanked him out of his seat, and forcefully shoved him to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy's face turned grim. He was about to fight back but was no match for Marcus' strength. Before he could react, he was on the floor, his expression one of utter humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you out of your mind? Jeremy is our distinguished guest, and you treat him like this? Do you have any respect for us?" Penny shouted, her face flushed with anger as she confronted Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sneered, "You two saw the bet clearly, didn't you? If I had lost, you'd have been the first to push me out of Shannon's life. But now that Jeremy's lost, you're calling me narrow-minded? Talk about double standards. You two are masters at it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words hit hard, leaving Kyle and Penny speechless, their faces turning bright red in embarrassment as they struggled to respond.</span></p><div class="pagination">
