  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to Helen's lies, the neighbors immediately sided with her, throwing out accusations one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiera took a deep breath, forcing herself to stay calm, and said, "Everyone, this isn't what you think. First of all, I never refused to move out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A few days ago, I renewed my lease with her for another six months and paid the full rent. According to the contract, if she forces me to leave early, she's the one breaking the agreement and should compensate me with two months' rent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I didn't want to make a fuss over it. I told her she didn't need to pay me compensation&mdash;just return my security deposit, and I would leave. But she refused. She's demanding I move out by tomorrow and won't return my deposit!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And as for this man next to me&mdash;his name is Marcus. He's my boyfriend, not some 'random man,' and certainly not a client. Everything she said about me was a complete lie!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiera's face was pale with frustration. She never imagined that Helen would stoop so low as to fabricate an entire story to frame her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The neighbors, upon hearing this, all looked at Helen, seemingly hoping to find answers from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many of them were unsure who to believe, but subconsciously, most were more inclined to trust Helen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she had been their neighbor for over twenty years, and they were more familiar with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen's face soured the moment she heard Kiera's words. She shouted in defense, "That's not true. This slut is lying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's only saying these things because she's afraid the truth about her prostitution will come out! If you don't believe me, let her show the proof!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, the neighbors nodded, thinking Helen made a good point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They weren't siding with her; they just felt that every claim required solid proof.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen seemed to sense that she had the upper hand. Smirking, she turned to Marcus and Kiera, taunting them, "What now? Show your proof, if you even have it. If you can't, I'll call the police right now. You two aren't just involved in prostitution and paying for sex; you've also assaulted me. I'll make sure both of you end up in jail!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her words, one of the onlookers chimed in, "Helen's right. If you two have a different story, show us the proof. Otherwise, we, as her neighbors, won't let you off the hook!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiera's expression darkened. She had only been arguing with Helen earlier, and there was no way to collect evidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, she didn't have any surveillance cameras at home. So all of this was just verbal defense, with no proof to back it up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Kiera's troubled look, Helen grew even more smug and continued with a wider smirk, "What's wrong, slut? No evidence, huh? And you still confronted me! Just wait&mdash;I'll call the cops and have both of you arrested!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiera glanced at Marcus, her eyes filled with desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's he gonna do? No evidence means no evidence. There's nothing you can do; just wait to be taken away," Helen said, wishing she could have Marcus and Kiera arrested right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do you know I don't have evidence?" Just then, Marcus spoke up, his tone sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was stunned, and Helen sneered, "If you have proof, then show it. Don't just bluff&mdash;it won't do you any good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold laugh, Marcus pulled out his phone, cranked the volume up to the max, and played a video recording.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The timestamp showed that the event had occurred just half an hour ago, right outside Kiera's apartment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The video clearly showed the entire argument between Helen and Kiera; their conversations were captured in full detail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curiosity filled the neighbors' faces, and all of them turned their attention to Marcus's phone screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they finished watching the entire video, their faces showed clear disapproval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I gotta say, Helen, that's a bit much. Don't you think? You demanded she leave the apartment without any reason, and then you refused to return her deposit? And you even blamed her, acting as if you were the victim! We've been neighbors for over twenty years, and if it weren't for this video, you would've almost tricked me too!" one of them said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, Helen, I'm really disappointed. You unjustly forced that young woman to move out, then falsely accused her of prostitution. And when she didn't want to argue, just asked for her deposit back, you still refused. You're just trying to rob her!" the other echoed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After watching the full video, all the neighbors turned their support to Kiera and Marcus.</span></p><div class="pagination">
