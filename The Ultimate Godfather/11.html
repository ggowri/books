  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus blurted it out before he could stop himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald... you..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's face flamed red as she hastily tugged at her skirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fresh from the shower, she hadn't bothered to put on new underwear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The maid's outfit exposed more on her upper part, and while the skirt was thick enough to hide what was underneath, it barely reached mid-thigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced over herself several times, finding no obvious giveaways. There was no way he could see through the fabric.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was totally confused by his sharpness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just... forget I said anything," Marcus mumbled, a bit unwilling to tear his eyes away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected her to be so... perfect. His body responded instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But using his X-ray ability came with serious consequences - dizziness, fatigue, and a dangerous drain on his Numinous Energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a forbidden technique for a reason. Extended use could cause permanent damage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With great reluctance, he switched it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's face burned brighter. "Mr. Fitzgerald," she bit her lip accusingly, "how on earth did you know I wasn't wearing any underwear? Were you watching me shower?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It is the only explanation for that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even warriors, wizards from Weston Land, curse weavers from Southvaia, and other metahumans rarely possess such an ability as seeing through objects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Marcus, the man who lived off the Winchester family, have X-ray vision?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's too much. She thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus choked on his water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could explain, Diana's voice turned silky. "I'm your assistant, Mr. Fitzgerald, and I belong to you. If you really want to watch me bathe, I wouldn't refuse either..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words wrapped around him like honey, making his pulse race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as things were heating up, the phone's sharp ring cut through the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus," she barked, "remember our deal. Hellton Hotel, VIP room, 8 PM sharp. If you don't come, you can kiss your adoptive parents and precious little sister goodbye."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The line went dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rage coursed through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That twisted bitch had gone too far! How dare she use my adoptive family to blackmail me!" Marcus roared, clenching his fists tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was Ryan Gellar's bastard son, raised in Solomia by his adoptive parents who loved him like their own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after their daughter was born, they never treated him differently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Marcus, they were his real family. He'd never forget their love and care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He checked the time - 7:30 PM.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only half an hour left. He </span><span>grabbed the car key and ran out of the house</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fifteen minutes later, he stood outside the VIP suite at the Hellton, ringing the bell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane opened the door, her wet hair cascading over her shoulders. Her body was wrapped in nothing but a white bath towel. She had just stepped out of the shower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even without makeup, her eyes were mesmerizing, her face seductive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right on time," she smirked. "Good boy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She locked the door and sprawled on the bed, long legs extended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come here. Massage my legs," she purred, crooking her finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her allure was unstoppable. Had this been in the past, Marcus might have entertained her demands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now his mind was elsewhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What have you done with my adoptive parents?" he asked with urgency. "Hand them over or things get ugly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane smiled coldly. "I haven't done anything to them. But would you have come if I hadn't said that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jane, are you out of your mind?" Marcus yelled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd tried calling home before coming. No answer. The silence was driving him crazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't tell you. What are you going to do about it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her smug face pushed him over the edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You fucking bitch, I'll kill you! Tell me or I'll snap your neck!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hand shot out, gripping her throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's face turned red as she clawed at his hands. But he only squeezed harder, eyes murderous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me!" he snarled. "Are you going to say it or not?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Choking, she gritted her teeth and spat, "Go ahead. Kill me! You'll never find them if I'm dead. Never."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to crush her throat, but he couldn't risk never finding out where his family was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Growling, he let go. "Fine. What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's eyes raked over his muscled body hungrily. She licked her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck me," she said boldly, her voice dripping with seduction. "Fuck me good and I'll tell you everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she let the bath towel fall to the floor, exposing her voluptuous body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her full breasts, flat stomach, and the intimate valley between her legs were all laid bare in front of Marcus.</span></p><div class="pagination">
