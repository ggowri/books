  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before Darren Crane, Leader of Team Tiger of Dragon Tiger Hall, could get anywhere near Lila, Marcus' voice cut through the air like a blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren paused, his face twisting into a sneer. "Who the hell do you think you are, brat? You got a death wish messing with me? You know who I am?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Darren reached out, his hand aiming to grab Marcus by the collar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Darren could even touch him, Marcus smacked him across the face with enough force to echo in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren hit the ground like a sack of bricks, his head spinning. One side of his face </span><span>ballooned up, glowing red like a warning sign.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liz, Jacqueline, and Abraham stared, slack-jawed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of them had expected Marcus actually to hit Darren. It was like walking up to a lion and slapping its face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You little bastard!" Darren snarled, clutching his cheek as he wobbled to his feet. "You're dead meat! I'll gut you myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He snatched a knife from one of his lackeys, the blade flashing in the dim light as he took a step forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another one of Darren's lackeys kept staring at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing something was off, he suddenly stepped up, waving his hands in alarm. "Wait, boss! Hold up!" he stammered, stepping between Darren and Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren glared at him, his eyes narrowing to slits. "What's your deal, huh? You better have a good reason for stopping me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lackey's voice quivered as he pointed toward Marcus. "Boss, I think I've seen him before. You might </span><span>wanna</span><span> think twice before you do anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren barked, his patience wearing thin. "</span><span>So</span><span> what if you've seen him? You see a lot of people every day! You think that means I can't handle him? Move it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get </span><span>outta</span><span> my way, or you'll be next!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lackey's face turned pale as he sputtered, "I swear, boss, he looks just like that guy the Axe Gang brought in yesterday&mdash;the one who took out our general! Maybe we shouldn't start something head-on with him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lackey had been there to gang up on Axe Gang, watching the chaos unfold as Marcus tore through Dragon Tiger Hall like a storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he had been far away during the fight, Marcus' face had been seared into his memory&mdash;it wasn't the kind you could forget.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus here today, the lackey couldn't believe his eyes at first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared hard, squinting as if his life depended on it, until he was absolutely sure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Smack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren didn't wait to hear more. His palm cracked across the lackey's face with a sickening slap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood sprayed from the man's nose as he stumbled, a couple of teeth scattering on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quit spouting garbage! This country bumpkin? No way he's that guy!" Darren roared. "Now, move, or I'll finish what I started!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been defending their headquarters, not in the mission the day before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fury was boiling over, his temper blinding him to reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the leader of Team Tiger, he wasn't used to being humiliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being slapped in front of everyone, especially with Lila watching, was a wound to his pride he couldn't ignore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lackey looked ready to cry but kept his mouth shut, stepping aside under Darren's glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, boys, show this punk what happens when you cross me!" Darren </span><span>barked,</span><span> his tone venomous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren's men grinned wickedly, pulling out weapons as they surrounded Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila's worry was clear as day on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a step toward Liz, ready to beg for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus raised a hand, stopping her. "Relax. They're nothing," he said, his tone casual, almost bored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the lackeys lunged, his weapon slicing through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' face hardened. A single bone-crunching punch sent the man sprawling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lackey crumpled like wet cardboard, groaning as he hit the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others charged, their weapons glinting as they aimed for Marcus with ruthless precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They attacked like rabid dogs, swinging wildly and without a care for consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A normal person would have no way of surviving this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liz squeezed her eyes shut, unable to watch what she thought would be a massacre.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had warned Lila to ask Marcus not to provoke Darren, but he hadn't listened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't just talk back to Darren&mdash;he had the audacity to slap him square in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now," she thought grimly, "he was reaping the consequences."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus didn't flinch at the lackeys. He moved like a panther, swift and unrelenting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room filled with the sound of fists meeting flesh and the groans of men hitting the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' punches were merciless, each one dropping a lackey like clockwork.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than a minute, the floor was littered with groaning bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fight had been clean, efficient, and utterly one-sided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the room stared in stunned silence, unable to believe their eyes. How could Marcus, such a seemingly ordinary guy, be this capable of combat?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Darren's bravado faltered as he studied Marcus, his eyes narrowing with a mix of caution and disbelief.</span></p><div class="pagination">
