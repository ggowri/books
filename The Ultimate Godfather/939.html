        <h1>Chapter 886 His Pride Was Immense-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I remember correctly, you've been stuck at a bottleneck for years. It's truly a cause for celebration that you finally broke through today," Roger remarked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stood with his hands clasped behind his back, exuding an aura as if he could command the world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What he didn't know, however, was that the woman standing before him had already </span><span>been claimed by his brother Marcus, long before he could even imagine it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though Roger wasn't particularly fond of women, the thought of someone else touching what was his, without his knowledge, was undeniably one of the greatest humiliations he could face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Roger Gellar," Alison said, her voice a bit stiff as she nodded to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, she stood before this tall, handsome man, feeling a whirlwind of emotions inside. She had no idea what to do next.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Alison were to tell Roger what happened today, would he find her repulsive? Would he think of her as tainted?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The answer was clear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alison knew Roger well. His pride was immense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Roger ever found out what had happened today, both she and Marcus would be doomed to nothing less than ruin.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Alison made a decision: she would bury this incident deep inside her, never to speak of it again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But that only made her feel guilty toward Roger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This inner conflict left Alison in turmoil, unsure how to face him now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus was unaware of Alison's inner turmoil. At that moment, he had returned to the McHale family estate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps Cecilia had overexerted herself earlier, for she had fallen asleep on his bed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Cecilia's angelic face, Marcus couldn't resist planting a gentle kiss on her forehead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was that soft touch that stirred her from her sleep. She murmured in her sleep, then, with a sleepy stretch, wrapped her arms around Marcus' neck.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The soft, fragrant warmth of her body sent a wave of emotion through Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without a second thought, he pulled her into his embrace, gently running his fingers through her golden hair.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I thought you weren't coming back," Cecilia whispered, her voice as sweet and smooth as honey.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How could I? Even if I went to </span><span>Uswad</span><span>, I'd still return to say goodbye. I wouldn't just leave without a word," Marcus replied with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecilia lifted her face to look at him, and unable to resist, kissed him softly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was at that moment that Marcus seized the opportunity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a sudden, forceful movement, he pushed her back onto the bed, capturing her lips in a passionate kiss.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mm..." Cecilia let out a soft moan, completely caught off guard by Marcus' fiery response.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even as their lips met, Marcus' hand was already cupping Cecilia's full, firm breasts. His fingers teased her nipples, already hard with anticipation. Cecilia was incredibly sensitive to his touch, her body a live wire in his presence. Even his casual caresses sent shivers through her, her lips parting to release a series of breathy, irresistible moans.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Almost simultaneously, Marcus' mouth closed over one of Cecilia's ample breasts, his </span><span>lips and tongue lavishing attention on her pink nipple, igniting her nerve endings. Cecilia was instantly swept away, her body responding with a surge of heat. Her secret place began to moisten.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald," she breathed, a playful protest in her voice, "you're terrible! All I did was kiss you, and now you're doing this to me. I'm not speaking to you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her struggles were half-hearted at best, and Marcus wasn't about to give her a chance to reconsider. With a swift movement, he shed his clothes, his gaze locked on Cecilia's expression, now a mixture of ecstasy and surrender. His desire was fully aroused, his manhood straining against his skin.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without hesitation, he positioned himself against Cecilia's dewy entrance and plunged in.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Cecilia was filled by Marcus' hardness once more, a cry of pure sensation escaping her lips. She was lost again in the throes of desire. Marcus moved on her with unrestrained passion, each thrust sending her spiraling higher. Waves of pleasure washed over Cecilia, her moans echoing through the room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The air crackled with a palpable tension, the sounds of their passion filling the space. They were soon consumed by the sheer ecstasy of the moment, reveling in each other's embrace. Their lovemaking lasted for nearly two hours before Marcus finally reached his peak, his seed spilling into Cecilia's depths.</span></p></div>
