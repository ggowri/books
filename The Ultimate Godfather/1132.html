  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's Marcus!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was shocked, their eyes wide open, especially Kyson.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He never expected that, at this moment, someone would dare to step forward seeking death!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Pedro said angrily, "He's just a nobody. How dare he interfere! Mr. Shelton, please kill him first, then capture those two women!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at Marcus with eyes full of sarcasm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his view, Marcus was just trying to play the hero, but he surely didn't have much ability.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Pedro believed that as long as Kyson made a move, Marcus would surely be killed!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kyson nodded, then stretched out his palm and struck fiercely toward Marcus!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The power of this hand is extremely powerful, containing the strange power of Lemuria Ophidian.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus was not unfamiliar with this power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had felt it before when he fought against Rivers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Kyson was stronger than Rivers, Marcus still wasn't afraid of him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Kyson's Hand Strike was about to land, Marcus threw a punch directly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This punch looked ordinary, as if it held no power at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone in the Leah family looked at Marcus mockingly, not expecting him to dare face Kyson, who had just defeated their 9 Grandmasters single-handedly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, he completely dominated them throughout the entire fight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even when the nine Grandmasters used the Ennead Rotation Celestial Formation, they were easily defeated by Kyson.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Apart from the others in the Leah family, Minerva also thought Marcus was too bold; he actually dared to court death!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In her view, even with the help of a secret treasure, Marcus couldn't possibly be a match for Kyson.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Kyson was simply too strong. Even the Leah family's Grandmasters were easily defeated. If Marcus wanted to stand up for Gertie, he probably couldn't last even a single move!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Marcus dare to launch an attack against him, Kyson mockingly said, "You're really courting death. You actually dare to challenge me. In that case, let me show you my strength!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, Kyson had already summoned his strongest aura, quickly channeling an even greater destructive force into his Hand Strike, aiming to make Marcus pay the ultimate price!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In just the blink of an eye, their attacks collided. Accompanied by a thunderous boom, an incredibly terrifying destructive force spread in all directions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kyson looked proud, gazing at Marcus as if he were an ant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his view, killing someone as useless as Marcus didn't require such a powerful attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he wanted the world to know the price of defying an Ophidian from Lemuria!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, as their attacks clashed more intensely, Kyson's expression gradually stiffened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could only feel an irresistible force rapidly emanating from Marcus's Fist Ray.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Marcus shattered and destroyed all the destructive force contained in Kyson's Hand Strike.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the power's might did not diminish at all, then enveloped Kyson's body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had a bad feeling. He quickly mobilized the energy around him, trying to amplify the power contained in his Hand Strike.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's just that everything seemed to be too late.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The power of Marcus's punch was nothing like what Kyson had imagined as ordinary.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, it possessed the power to destroy heaven and earth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next moment, everyone saw Kyson's Hand Strike shatter inch by inch under Marcus's punch.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A supreme destructive force descended upon his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A terrifying rumble echoed continuously. With a scream from Kyson, his body was blasted away like a cannonball, slamming hard into the cliff wall of Emotionless Gorge, causing it to collapse and crumble as dust surged into the air!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This scene left everyone present stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kyson, Roderick's subordinate, is a top expert in the Acquired State Eight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had just single-handedly overpowered the nine Grandmasters of the Leah family. The Leah family's proud Ennead Rotation Celestial Formation was rendered powerless and easily broken.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet at this moment, the mighty Kyson couldn't withstand even a single attack from Marcus, being embarrassingly blasted away by his punch.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is simply unbelievable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many people even thought they were dreaming or hallucinating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Especially Minerva, who widened her beautiful eyes in shock. Her gaze on Marcus became completely dazed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before this, she had always thought he relied on an artifact to easily suppress her in battle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If the family's Grandmaster took action, Marcus wouldn't stand a chance and would be easily killed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The reason is simple. If his strength isn't at a certain level, he can't control a powerful artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Minerva's view, the Leah family's Grandmasters' strength far exceeded the scope of artifacts Marcus could control.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, Kyson couldn't even withstand a single punch from Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Minerva knew this wasn't the power of an artifact but Marcus's own strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He, a young man in his twenties who hadn't experienced samsara, actually possessed such terrifying strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Minerva could hardly believe any of this was real.</span></p><div class="pagination">
