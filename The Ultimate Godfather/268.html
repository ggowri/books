  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many people were shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one expected something like that to happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, even what Giles failed to predict was done by Marcus!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Truman's face turned gloomy. His eyes were filled with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Camila and Jennifer were also completely disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They didn't expect Marcus to guess the ending correctly. It was unbelievable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How is it possible? It can't be? This energy crystal is the top grade, and the structure inside is also intact! I have explored it many times before, and there is no problem. How can it suddenly have cracks?" Giles asked with incredulity, raised his finger, and pointed to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Spill it! Did you play tricks to make this energy crystal crack? Or how could a good piece of crystal burst for no reason?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words seemed to remind everyone. They all looked at Marcus with suspicion in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Especially Truman, Camila, and Jennifer were full of resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Dupont, Mr. Hansen is right. Marcus must have pulled some tricks. He is jealous of you, so he used some shady tricks!" Camila once again took the lead in accusing Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That looks like it. Otherwise, how can he predict the cracks that Mr. Hansen failed to see?" Jennifer added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You all have gone too far!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald saw the problem first and kindly reminded you, but you didn't listen. The crystal burst, but you accused him. You ungrateful bastards!" Cooke couldn't stand it any longer and scolded them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who do you think you are? Do you deserve to talk to Mr. Dupont and others like this? Don't you want to live anymore?" Camila gritted her teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a lineal figure of the Ancient Martial Art family, she had innate confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cooke was only at Ancient Martial Stage One. So Camila did not take him seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm telling the truth. According to you, can't I talk anymore or what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cooke did not back down at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Camila seemed pissed and went straight forward to slap Cooke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cooke's cultivation was not as good as hers, so if she took action, he would have to take it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, before Camila could hit him, her wrist was held by Marcus. "I kept giving in before because I didn't want to argue with you. But don't you underestimate my strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Camila looked pale and struggled hard, but she could not break free from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Loser, let me go now! Or don't blame me for being ruthless!" Camila threatened him, but Marcus' hand only tightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Camila felt an irresistible pressure on her wrist. It was like her wrist could be crushed at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let her go!" Truman spoke up. His voice came with a hint of threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus ignored Truman and with a snap, Camila's wrist was broken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How dare you hurt my people! Now leave your arm here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Camila screamed and her forehead was full of cold sweat. She never expected Marcus to dare to attack her in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Camila!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jennifer rushed to help Camila and warned Marcus, "Pauper, the Gunter family of is the Ancient Martial Art family. You hurt her and you are doomed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, before Jennifer could finish speaking, Marcus stepped out and appeared in front of her like a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, a thunder-like slap landed on Jennifer's face and knocked her down to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her tender face swelled up high and appeared blue and purple. She was miserable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone can't help but hiss at the scene. They never expected that this young man, who had been silent and reserved before, would have such a hot temper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More importantly, his movement speed was so fast that everyone present didn't react, and Jennifer was beaten!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They did not know that Marcus was using the Shadow Step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only an old man at Ancient Martial Stage Four once practiced this kind of cultivation manual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, dealing with Jennifer who was at Ancient Martial Stage Two was a piece of cake for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is what's coming your way if you insult me. Once more curse and I will rip your mouth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus cast a glance at Jennifer and his words carried threats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jennifer was angry and looked at Marcus with resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said directly to Truman, "Mr. Dupont, this pauper is outrageous! He publicly hits me and doesn't even take you seriously. Sir, please punish him severely!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
