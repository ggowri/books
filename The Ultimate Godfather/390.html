  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catherine turned her head and saw two women and a man walking towards her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two women were about the same age as Catherine, and both were dressed beautifully. Although their appearance was not as good as Catherine's, they were eye-catching among ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The woman who was holding a man's arm had a pretty face and a hot body, looking very charming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man in branded clothes looked gentle. It was just that most ordinary people couldn't recognize them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two women were Sheila Bair and Betsy Kohler. Catherine looked at them and said with surprise, "Sheila? Betsy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catherine hadn't seen Sheila and Betsy for more than ten years, but she could still recognize them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Catherine, it's really you. We haven't seen each other for more than ten years. You are more beautiful than when you were a child!" Betsy stepped forward and held Catherine's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catherine had always been the most beautiful girl in class. After many years, she had become even more attractive. Even though she dressed simply, she was just outstanding among the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sheila and Betsy were both specially dressed up. They thought they were beautiful enough. However, standing in front of Catherine, they found that they were no match for her at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man next to Sheila looked at Catherine, and his eyes lit up. There was a glimmer of lust in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betsy looked at Catherine and said, "Catherine, this man is Scales Bernard, Sheila's boyfriend. He is engaged in the pharmaceutical equipment installation and maintenance industry. He has achieved the top three in the region in this industry. He should be the best boyfriend among the girls in our class."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A hint of arrogance flashed in Sheila's eyes when she heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sheila concealed her smug look well, but Marcus noticed it. Sheila said, "Betsy, I have to keep a low profile. Scales is indeed excellent, but I don't want to show off in front of others."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Scales greeted Catherine and Marcus. Sheila asked Catherine, "Catherine, you haven't introduced this man to us yet!" The person Sheila was referring to was Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is my boyfriend, Marcus Fitzgerald," Catherine said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well, good. He is quite handsome and strong," Sheila smiled, thinking that Marcus had nothing to praise, so she could only praise his appearance to avoid embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sheila, it's not an era to make money by strength. Marcus is handsome and strong, but in my opinion, Scales is much better." Betsy glanced at Scales with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betsy didn't have a boyfriend yet. On the way here, Scales had promised to introduce Betsy to a boss in the industry. It made Betsy very happy. She had never thought that she would be able to hook up with a rich man one day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was just a promise, but Betsy had already started imaging her future wealthy life. She was very grateful to Sheila and Scales.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sheila smiled, feeling proud of Betsy's praise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Catherine, did you two drive here?" Betsy asked, casually glancing behind Catherine and Marcus as if she was very curious about what kind of car Marcus had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catherine said honestly, "We came here by taxi."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betsy smiled, "Your boyfriend is so handsome, but he doesn't even have a car. It would be so convenient if he had a car. Then, you don't have to squeeze into buses or subways!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catherine didn't expect Betsy to misunderstand her. Catherine hurriedly explained, "Marcus has a car, but it has been hit on the way here and was sent to the service store, so we took a taxi here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well..." Betsy nodded meaningfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sheila seemed very curious and asked, "Catherine, what kind of car does your boyfriend have? I'm just curious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catherine didn't know too much about cars, so she asked Marcus, "Marcus, what brand is your car? I don't know it. The logo has two wings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betsy rolled his eyes and blurted out, "Oh, I know the brand of the car."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sheila nodded. "It's a cheap car, but it's nice, fuel-efficient and economical. Anyway, it's much better than squeezing into the bus or subway."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, Catherine seemed to have remembered the brand and said, "I remember it. It's Aston Martin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Upon hearing this, Sheila, Betsy, and Scales were all stunned. Then, they laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sheila couldn't help but ask Scales, "Honey, how much does an Aston Martin cost? It seems to be quite expensive!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
