        <h1>Chapter 27 Save Natalia</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia remained defiant, delivering a swift kick right between the legs of the thug gripping her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He howled in pain, but instead of backing off, his anger only grew. "You little slut, you hit me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the other thug caught on, he began to rain down punches and kicks on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her fierce spirit, Natalia was just nineteen and no match for these street thugs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't long before she was overpowered by two more men who had jumped out of the van.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't expect this little firecracker to fight back. I like it. Drag her in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sleazy voice called out from the backseat of the Mercedes, revealing a man with a messy scar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I swear, if you touch me, my sister's husband is the chairman of Golden Group!" Natalia shouted, panic overtaking her bravado.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt utterly helpless, realizing no one was there to rescue her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a moment of desperation, she blurted out Marcus' name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thugs couldn't care less. "Golden Group's chairman? That's cute. If you're going to throw names around, I'm the king of the world!" one laughed derisively as they tightened their grip on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as they were about to force her into the van, a tall figure appeared seemingly out of nowhere, blocking their path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus swept his gaze over the scene and spoke coldly, "You guys think it's okay to gang up on a girl like this? What a bunch of losers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus hadn't intended to get involved, but seeing Natalia in danger stirred something deep inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Abigail had betrayed him and put his life at risk, Natalia had never done anything more than tease him a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the way she called him in a moment of fear tugged at his heartstrings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To top it off, given the intimacy they shared last time, Marcus had no reason to hesitate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus... Is that really you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia blinked in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's me. Don't worry, I'm here. They won't lay a finger on you," Marcus assured her, a smile on his face that made her feel safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Marcus transformed in Natalia's eyes into a hero&mdash;a protector.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All her previous judgments about him faded away in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who do you think you are to meddle in our business? I'd suggest you find out who Mr. Wallace is before you make any moves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the thugs sneered, puffing out his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bob Wallace, their fearless leader and the most formidable figure in the underworld of this street, was a name no one dared to cross paths with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus shot back defiantly. "Enough with the chit-chat. Let her go&mdash;now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thug's patience snapped, their smirks betraying their intentions. "Looks like you're too stubborn for your own good. Let's see how tough you are when we break your legs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they shifted Natalia aside, brandishing knives, Marcus stood his ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring their threats, he surged forward, expertly taking them down with a few swift punches and kicks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Natalia, let's get out of here!" he said, glancing back at her, urging her to follow. "Okay!" she nodded eagerly, ready to escape with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not so fast! You think you can just waltz away after attacking my boys? You're the first person to be so bold in my presence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A voice boomed from behind Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the Mercedes-Benz, a man stepped out with a scar on his face&mdash;Bob Wallace himself. He was flanked by a few burly henchmen wielding baseball bats, each one radiating menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want?" Marcus challenged, standing firm against the growing threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bob sneered, tossing a dagger at Marcus' feet. "Leave the girl with me and chop off three fingers yourself, and I'll let you walk away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll see about that," Marcus replied with interest, having never before encountered the underground element of Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that failing to subdue these men would put not only Natalia at risk but also other girls on the street in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bob roared, waving a hand to signal his thugs, "Go get him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the henchmen charged at Marcus with their baseball bats swinging wildly, it was clear they were a different breed from the previous thugs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were stronger, more seasoned fighters. But they had no idea who they were up against. Marcus was a warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, these tough guys were nothing more than ants, easily crushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In mere moments, he dispatched the henchmen with a speed that left Natalia breathless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She watched in awe as he moved with precision and power, a stark contrast to her previous perceptions of him. Just days ago, she had seen Marcus as weak and vulnerable, a man diminished by the loss of a kidney.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he was taking down these thugs like it was a walk in the park. It was nothing short of miraculous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bob's expression shifted from arrogance to disbelief. "Didn't see that coming. Looks like you're tougher than I thought."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nonchalantly kicked the dagger Bob had thrown at him back towards him. "You know the drill. Cut off three of your fingers, and today's little incident will be forgotten."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bob, who had been immersed in the street life since his teens, was no stranger to pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second thought, he picked up the knife and severed three of his fingers, gritting his teeth against the agony. "Can I leave now?" he asked, his voice strained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost. And don't let me see you on this street again. If I do, I'll make sure to beat you up every single time," Marcus warned coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bob clutched his bleeding hand, looking utterly defeated as he stumbled away, leaving a trail of crimson behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, Marcus... That was incredible!" Natalia exclaimed, her admiration spilling over as she watched Bob retreat in disgrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing here?" Marcus asked, his brow furrowing in curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He remembered that, while Natalia could be a bit spoiled and headstrong, she was also a top student who never frequented places like this.</span></p></div>
