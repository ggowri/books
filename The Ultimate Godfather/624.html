  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Albert, spending 5.88 million dollars on a birthday gift for Luna was a relatively infrequent occurrence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Albert, thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Luna stood on her tiptoe and kissed Albert on the lips, immediately causing the girls present to break into exciting cheers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His family conditions were actually in line with what she had conjectured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he was a native of Solariae, his family belonged to the middle class.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, shelling out more than five million dollars on a birthday gift had reached the upper limit of what Albert could afford.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled, "Luna, given your status, you deserve the Tears of the Angel. Since you are in a hasty return to Uswad, I will buy it for you next time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, if he was really asked to purchase it, it would be impossible for him to gather that large sum of available money all at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna shook her head and gazed at him passionately. "Albert, I am very satisfied with your consideration for me. Any birthday gift from you, regardless of what it might be, will delight me extremely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the girls present were touched by their loving atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Romantic and generous, Albert was worthy of being the heartthrob for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he experienced a sense of being the center of attention, with his ego receiving an even greater boost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was still a vast distance from his original purpose of coming here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he fixed his eyes on Marcus and said, "I had no idea of your family background. However, Jade is the girl I've been pursuing for two long years without success. She is very outstanding. As her boyfriend, you should have prepared a birthday present for her. Take it out and show it to us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words immediately piqued the curiosity of everyone. They were eager to find out what birthday gift Marcus had prepared for Jade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if it was not better than the Angel's Kiss, they could accept it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, a product priced at 5.88 million dollars was beyond the financial reach of most people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if the gift Marcus had prepared was inferior to the diamond ring worth 280 thousand dollars that Albert had given to Jade, it would be a disgrace to him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Marcus' appearance didn't really suggest he was a rich man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girls had sought confirmation from Jade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they previously inquired about Marcus' identity, her response was laced with hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without making any mention of his family's circumstances, she only said that he was an excellent doctor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What birthday gift did you give Jade? Take it out and show it to us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She was the most beautiful girl in our class. If the gift is too shoddy, it indicates you don't hold her in high regard. Then, we won't approve of her being with you any longer!" said a girl who had admired Albert before.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the other girls started to make a fuss, urging Marcus to show them the gift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade was slightly embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't on account of her supposing that Marcus couldn't afford to purchase a present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The primary reason was that she had been rather hasty in informing him to attend the party. Thus, it was quite normal if he hadn't prepared a gift for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Jade, gifts of great worth held no importance. What she cared about was Marcus treating her sincerely and with care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, she was not confident that he would really prepare a decent gift for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her opinion, since she was so easily with Marcus, he might not truly cherish her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But all this was between them, and she didn't want others to get involved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Albert actually brought up the matter in public, obviously trying to make a fool of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade hurriedly said, "I only told Marcus two hours ago that it is my birthday today, so even if he didn't prepare a gift for me, or the gift isn't expensive enough, you should not blame him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I like Marcus, not because of any financial considerations. It will remain the same in the future. No matter what he gives me, I will be overjoyed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't help but cast a deep glance at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his surprise, despite being usually careless, she was actually quite considerate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her statement was obviously a defense for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was aware of it, and many of them frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some were a bit puzzled as to why Jade was captivated by Marcus to this extent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only a girl grumbled, "Jade, stop making excuses for him. You are in a relationship, but he doesn't even remember your birthday. Isn't this his fault?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A man who needs his girlfriend to remind him of her birthday is truly unreliable. Look, how romantic Albert is! Jade, be smart. You should have said yes to Albert back then. He's better than your boyfriend anyway!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! Jade, Albert is indeed attentive to Luna. He prepared a gift for her with great care and also got one for you. A man such as he is the epitome of an ideal husband."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another girl tried to persuade Jade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't waste time. Let's just see what gift this man bought for Jade!" another girl said.</span></p><div class="pagination">
