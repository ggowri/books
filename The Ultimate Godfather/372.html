Abel and Josiah haven't appeared. It's not as simple as you think!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver still frowned.

"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abel said, and the palm and the back of his hand unexpectedly automatically grew several sharp steel thorns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He punched Oliver in the chest, only to hear a splash, and Oliver was suddenly raw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the strong force, Oliver was directly blown out and spit out one mouthful of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abel stepped forward and kicked Oliver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The so-called god of war has nothing special!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver stood up with his teeth clenched even though he was seriously injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Abel didn't want to give him a chance, trying to kill him with one blow. At this time, the iron gate of the data center was opened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An invisible strength came, and Abel's attack was intercepted directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When people looked around, they saw a tall figure slowly coming in from outside the iron gate, and it was Marcus who had disappeared a long time!</span></p><div class="pagination">
