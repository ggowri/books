        <h1>Chapter 371 Nothing Special</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, under the guidance of Oliver, the combat team rushed into the core position of the data center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was also the most densely populated area of the Black Hawk Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gunshots rang out constantly, and bullets rained down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver, with his superior individual combat capability, shot several people from the Black Hawk Legion in the head in a row and successfully occupied a strategic place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a time, the whole data center was shrouded in war, gunshots kept ringing, and both sides competed for the opportunity to survive in the rain of bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides Oliver, Maxine and the others also had strong individual combat capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gun battle lasted about half an hour, and Black Hawk Legion gradually lost its dominant position, and the rest of the SWAT officers who were ambushed in the rear also rushed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this way, after another 10 minutes, the Black Hawk Legion was almost wiped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The God of War is mighty!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this scene, many SWAT officers cheered loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked at Oliver with worship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be too happy. Abel and Josiah haven't appeared. It's not as simple as you think!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver still frowned. He knew that the people they killed were nothing of the Black Hawk Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The real big shot hadn't appeared, which was what he was most worried about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the sound of closing the door came from the rear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many SWAT officers discovered that someone had locked the iron gate of the data center outside!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, we've been tricked!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver looked pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They finally understand that Abel and Josiah wanted to lure them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was all too late. This was the only door in the data center, and it was made of high-strength steel plates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a short time, they couldn't escape at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, however, Oliver and others behind the bearing, suddenly there was dense gunfire rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several SWAT officers were shot to the ground, and Oliver's left shoulder was also shot, bleeding profusely!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lord God of War!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this scene, the rest of the SWAT officers looked extremely gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver was their backbone and pillar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Oliver was seriously injured, they lost hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several SWAT officers raised their guns and shot at the shooter in the rear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the other party could ignore the bullet attack, and the bullet fell on the body and just gave off white smoke. There was no harm to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gatling machine guns in the hands of each other were shooting at them crazily!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cyborg!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine reacted, and the Black Hawk Legion had such a powerful cyborg!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, they had quietly transported the cyborg to Uswad!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This reminded her of what Marcus said before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The real main force of the Black Hawk Legion had not yet arrived, and would not appear in front of them in the form of a frontal charge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that time, she only believed Oliver and even thought that Marcus was slacking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't expect everything to be guessed by Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uswadian people, you've been tricked, just die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abel and Josiah walked out of a hidden area at this time, looking arrogant</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They also held heavy weapons in their hands, while moving forward, and shooting wildly at Oliver, Maxine, and others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>SWAT officers also shot back, only to find that Abel and Josiah were as hard as walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only could they ignore the attack of bullets, but their bodies were like a precise mechanical device.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could detect the figure hiding behind the bunker and shoot in an extremely accurate way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a time, many SWAT officers had been killed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his people fall one by one, Oliver's eyes were scarlet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they had run out of ammunition, oil, and lamps, and there was no for them chance to fight back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abel and Josiah were approaching step by step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver rushed to Abel and tried to fight in close combat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abel sneered and said, "Are you Oliver, the famous god of war in Uswad? I have heard of your name for a long time. Today I will see how powerful you can be as a Uswad's god of war! "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abel said, and the palm and the back of his hand unexpectedly automatically grew several sharp steel thorns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He punched Oliver in the chest, only to hear a splash, and Oliver was suddenly raw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the strong force, Oliver was directly blown out and spit out one mouthful of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abel stepped forward and kicked Oliver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The so-called god of war has nothing special!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver stood up with his teeth clenched even though he was seriously injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Abel didn't want to give him a chance, trying to kill him with one blow. At this time, the iron gate of the data center was opened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An invisible strength came, and Abel's attack was intercepted directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When people looked around, they saw a tall figure slowly coming in from outside the iron gate, and it was Marcus who had disappeared a long time!</span></p></div>
