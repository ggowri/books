  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen's face turned ashen with rage. She immediately turned to the neighbors and said, "You&hellip; you traitors! We've been neighbors for so many years, and yet, instead of supporting me, you're siding with this slut!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You all disappoint me. I shouldn't have called you out here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she finished speaking, Marcus stepped forward and grabbed her by the collar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Helen appeared to weigh around 220 pounds, in Marcus's grip, she was like a chicken, easily lifted off the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want Kiera to vacate the apartment, you follow the contract: compensate us for two months' rent and return the deposit. Otherwise, no matter who shows up, we won't leave!" Marcus declared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he let go, and Helen fell heavily to the ground, screaming in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus now rolled in money&mdash;he could easily take out hundreds of millions without batting an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His reason for demanding the rent refund wasn't about the money, but because he was disgusted by Helen's repugnant attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lying on the ground, Helen cried loudly while shouting, "You disgusting scoundrel, bullying me just because I'm a woman, huh?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is not over. I'm calling my husband right now to have you arrested. A year or two in jail will teach you who truly holds the power here, the hard way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, the neighbors cast concerned looks at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An elderly lady with a kind face quickly walked up to Marcus and whispered, "Young man, this woman's husband is the second-in-command at the police precinct in this area. Honestly, I'd advise you not to get on her bad side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's been unreasonable for years, and her husband never interferes&mdash;he actually encourages her behavior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today you've already crossed him over a few thousand dollars of rent. It's not worth risking jail over. You'd better leave with your girlfriend before her husband shows up with the police. At that point, even if you're in the right, you won't get a chance to explain yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another neighbor standing nearby winked at Marcus, nodding in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen's husband, Dexter, had been the deputy chief of the police precinct for many years and had amassed quite a fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was rumored that his net worth was over a hundred million and he owned dozens of properties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of this, Helen had never worked a day in her life and managed rental properties as a landlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, the family's monthly rental income was easily between 200,000 and 300,000, making them a very wealthy household.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, Dexter was far from the typical good cop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was involved in corruption, bribery, collusion with criminals, abuse of power for personal gain, and other sorts of shady dealings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, a tenant had gotten into an argument with Helen over a rental issue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen, relying on her husband's influence, struck the tenant first, causing serious injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Dexter had simply paid a small compensation to smooth things over, and his wife was never punished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since then, Helen had become even more arrogant, knowing that as long as she didn't offend anyone more powerful than her husband, she could do whatever she pleased without fear of legal consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was exactly why she felt justified in demanding that Kiera move out early, without providing the compensation specified in the contract or refunding the deposit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing the neighbors' warnings, Marcus raised an eyebrow slightly and then gave the elderly lady and the neighbor a reassuring look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Helen and asked, "Your husband's name is Dexter Gibson?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the mention of her husband's name, Helen's face immediately showed an arrogant look. She raised her head high and said, "Now that you know my husband's name, you'd better apologize right now! Otherwise, when he shows up, you'll regret it. It won't be so easy to settle things then."</span></p><div class="pagination">
