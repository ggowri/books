        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is impossible! How could you possess such powerful Devouring Power? What kind of monster are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man could feel his Numinous Energy rapidly draining away as he struggled desperately against the invisible force, but his efforts proved futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes widened with terror as he stared at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus mockingly smiled as he sneered, "None of that matters now! You're nothing more than fuel for my powers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus intensified his Devouring power as he spoke, causing the middle-aged man's body to convulse even more violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As an expert at Acquired State Two, the man possessed more Numinous Energy than Marcus' previous victims combined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Devouring process lasted a full ten minutes before it finally came to an end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man's resistance transformed from desperate struggling to hopeless screaming until he could only submit to Marcus' harvesting of his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He helplessly watched as Marcus drained away the Numinous </span><span>Energy</span><span> he had spent centuries cultivating within his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes grew increasingly unfocused until they became utterly lifeless, while his skin slowly shriveled, leaving nothing but a desiccated corpse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing the surging Numinous Energy within his body, Marcus nodded with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was confident that absorbing this Numinous Energy would take his cultivation to the next level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he collected the Spatial Rings from the two middle-aged men and unleashed his Fire Attribute Power, reducing their bodies to ashes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sea breeze swept through, carrying away their remains as if they had never existed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With my current strength, even an Acquired State Six expert would struggle against me if I went all out. Once I absorb this guy's Numinous Energy and advance my cultivation further, I'll become even more formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I meet Alison again, if she hasn't advanced her cultivation, I'll have enough power to take her on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus thought to himself, a satisfied smile spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recalled the events of two months ago when Alison descended from the skies above </span><span>Solomia</span><span> and overwhelmed him with sheer power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus felt angry as he remembered how helpless he would have been without Diana's intervention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, he couldn't put up any resistance against Alison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, he was just a Foundation Establishment Stage warrior, no different from an ant facing Alison, a Level Seven Demon Fighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, merely two months later, Marcus was about to become an Acquired State expert capable of competing with Alison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wondered what Alison would think if she knew about his rapid progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus snapped back to reality and returned to the patrol car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since all three of them were Acquired State experts, a real-world battle would have torn the fabric of reality apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why they had set up a Rune to contain their battlefield before the fight began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The area appeared utterly peaceful to any observer as if nothing had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one would have guessed that an epic battle between Acquired State experts had just occurred there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If word got out, Marcus' single-handed defeat of two Acquired State Two experts would send shockwaves through the world of the Ancient Martial Art of </span><span>Uswad</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to the Rune, even Maxine remained utterly unaware of the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus returned, Maxine asked, "Did you handle the situation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I managed to chase those guys off," Marcus replied casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He deliberately kept the true nature of events from Maxine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given Maxine's current understanding, she wasn't ready to accept the existence of Return Essence stage warriors, so Marcus chose to tell a white lie.</span></p></div>
