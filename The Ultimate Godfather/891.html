What kind of monster are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man could feel his Numinous Energy rapidly draining away as he struggled desperately against the invisible force, but his efforts proved futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes widened with terror as he stared at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus mockingly smiled as he sneered, "None of that matters now! You're nothing more than fuel for my powers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus intensified his Devouring power as he spoke, causing the middle-aged man's body to convulse even more violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As an expert at Acquired State Two, the man possessed more Numinous Energy than Marcus' previous victims combined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Devouring process lasted a full ten minutes before it finally came to an end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man's resistance transformed from desperate struggling to hopeless screaming until he could only submit to Marcus' harvesting of his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He helplessly watched as Marcus drained away the Numinous </span><span>Energy</span><span> he had spent centuries cultivating within his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes grew increasingly unfocused until they became utterly lifeless, while his skin slowly shriveled, leaving nothing but a desiccated corpse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing the surging Numinous Energy within his body, Marcus nodded with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was confident that absorbing this Numinous Energy would take his cultivation to the next level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he collected the Spatial Rings from the two middle-aged men and unleashed his Fire Attribute Power, reducing their bodies to ashes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sea breeze swept through, carrying away their remains as if they had never existed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With my current strength, even an Acquired State Six expert would struggle against me if I went all out.
