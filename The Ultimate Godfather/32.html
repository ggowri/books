        <h1>Chapter 31 Serpent's Coil Was in His Grasp</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tory's expression darkened, disbelief washing over him. He had never imagined that someone would dare to infiltrate the Cyan Serpent Lodge alone, let alone threaten his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was utterly insane!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the president of Serpent's Coil, Tory possessed an innate confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with Marcus proclaiming to kill him, he stood his ground, hands clasped behind his back, unflinching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the air was pierced by the sound of gunfire, sharp and relentless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bullets erupted from every corner of the lodge, converging on Marcus like a swarm of angry hornets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't mastered the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, Marcus would have been overwhelmed by the sheer volume of firepower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, having reached the primordial ascension stage of Ancient Martial Stage One, Marcus had undergone a transformation that was nothing short of miraculous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time seemed to slow down around him; the bullets, though fast, became almost sluggish in his perception.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With fluid grace, he dodged and weaved, evading the hail of gunfire that would have fallen an ordinary man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Marcus stood before Tory, who stared in horror, realizing too late that Marcus had defied the laws of gunfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're a warrior!" Tory gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Comprehension dawned just as Marcus' hand closed around his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a powerful grip, Tory began to cough violently, struggling for breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a desperate bid, he unleashed the warrior aura within him, attempting to push back against Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Tory was merely a half-warrior, not yet fully initiated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His strength, while formidable against ordinary foes, was nothing compared to Marcus' raw power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, don't kill me! I'll do anything if you spare my life!" Tory pleaded, panic lacing his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, offered no mercy. With a swift motion, he snapped Tory's neck, ending the reign of one of Solomia's most notorious figures in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gasps filled the room as the high-ranking members of Serpent's Coil stood frozen in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected the once-mighty Tory, so full of life and ambition, to meet such a brutal end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bob stared, his mouth agape; to him, Tory had been a god among men, invincible and commanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here Tory lay, lifeless, crushed like a mere chick in Marcus' grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overwhelming display of power shattered Bob's bravado, leaving him shaken as he recalled his own earlier bravado in Marcus' presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tory is dead. Will you all submit to me?" Marcus declared, tossing Tory's lifeless body to the ground, his voice steady and commanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of fear rippled through the Serpent's Coil leaders as they exchanged glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Seven Stars Association leader, Edgar Trevino, stepped forward, bowing deeply. "The Seven Stars Association pledge our loyalty to you, my lord. From this day forward, we will go through fire and water for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, others followed suit, recognizing the futility of resistance against a monster who feared nothing, not even bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew that submission was their only path to survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus surveyed the room, his gaze piercing. "I am the third son of the Godfather. From now on, you will call me Mr. Fitzgerald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My goal is simple: unify the underground world of Solomia within a year!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of Serpent's Coil exchanged astonished looks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whispers of Ryan's illegitimate son had circulated before, but now it was confirmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this son was every bit as ruthless and decisive as his legitimate brothers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They understood that by aligning themselves with Marcus, they were stepping into a dangerous game&mdash;the struggle for the Godfather's legacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a double-edged sword; success could lead to power, but failure would mean certain death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We pledge my allegiance to you, Mr. Fitzgerald!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that declaration, every member of Serpent's Coil bowed deeply, their faces a mix of fear and respect. Marcus' gaze landed on Edgar. "I won't be around often. You'll manage everything that happens in Serpent's Coil from now on. Think you can handle it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edgar beamed at this unexpected trust, his posture straightening as he replied eagerly, "I won't let you down, Mr. Fitzgerald!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning his attention to Bob, Marcus continued, "Eric is dead. You're taking his place now. You'll also assist the Seven Stars Association leader with your tasks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bob could hardly believe his ears. The thought of stepping into Eric's shoes had never even crossed his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood there, momentarily stunned, before finally replying, "Thank you, Mr. Fitzgerald, for this opportunity! From this moment on, my life belongs to you. I'll serve you loyally, no matter what it takes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Serpent's Coil now in his grasp, Marcus officially launched his quest to unify the criminal and business world of Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After giving his orders, he made his way out of the lodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the car left for Natalia, Marcus approached the street, ready to hail a taxi back to Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the headlights of a car flashed, and a sleek white BMW rolled to a stop in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The window slid down, revealing Jane's strikingly beautiful face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus, hop in."</span></p></div>
