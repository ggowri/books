        <h1>Chapter 619 Blonde Girl</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joan unleashed a thunderous roar of anger. "Kill him! Whoever slays that man will be lavishly rewarded. I will bear full responsibility!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The security guards, energized by her words, became agitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gabe sneered at Marcus, saying, "Dude, though your wealth exceeds my expectations, you've offended someone you shouldn't have. Don't blame us for our fists!" As he spoke, several security guards lunged forward, intent on attacking Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled. Confronting these guards, he effortlessly employed his Fist Ray, effortlessly defeating them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Marcus' punches, the security guards tumbled to the ground one by one, moaning in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was astounded. Marcus' combat prowess was beyond their wildest imagin</span><span>ation</span><span>s.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the store's security guards were retired special forces soldiers, incapable of being matched by ordinary individuals. At this juncture, to confront Marcus, over a dozen bodyguards moved in unison. Even so, within less than two minutes, Marcus single-handedly knocked all the security guards to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such strength was far beyond the comprehension of everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joan and Natalie were equally astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't even spare a glance at the guards on the ground and walked out of the mall with the jewelry he had purchased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Darling, I was assaulted in the mall. Some jerk hit me. Find out who he is and avenge me!" Staring at Marcus' back, Joan dialed her husband's phone, saying it through gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man on the other end of the line responded angrily, "Don't worry. That person will pay the price!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Joan's husband's words, Natalie couldn't help but snicker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Marcus had offended Joan, he would surely face dire consequences in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Marcus knew nothing about their plan. At this moment, he was driving his Aston Martin towards the mall where Jade awaited him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to the time wasted earlier in the jewelry store and the congested traffic, he could only proceed at a snail's pace on the road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus drove, he caught a glimpse out of the corner of his eye. A crowd had gathered not far away on the roadside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the gaps in the crowd, he saw a blonde-haired, blue-eyed girl lying motionless on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was in a deep coma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several foreigners stood beside her, anxiously dialing the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that the girl had suddenly succumbed to some kind of illness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to the traffic jam, Marcus was mere meters away from the roadside where the girl lay, allowing him a clear view of what was </span><span>happening</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just ahead was a turning that permitted parking, so Marcus parked his car at the intersection and walked towards the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong with her?" Marcus inquired of a bearded man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He replied anxiously, "We are from Acoton. She suddenly had a heart attack, a result of her congenital heart defect, and I'm calling an ambulance to take her to the hospital!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gazed at the pale girl on the ground and swiftly activated his X-ray vision to assess her condition, then said, "Her heart condition is grave. If she doesn't receive prompt treatment within five minutes, she might perish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's rush hour now. Even if you call an ambulance, it could take a considerable time to arrive, and it might be too late. Alright, can I give it a try? Don't stop dialing the emergency number. She should be able to hold on until the ambulance arrives."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't a savior and wouldn't easily come to someone's aid, but in this situation, he couldn't ignore it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bearded man pondered for a moment. Since they had to await the ambulance anyway, they might as well let Marcus try to treat her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he nodded to Marcus and said, "That would be wonderful. Thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his consent, Marcus promptly activated the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire. A surge of Timeless Numinous Energy flowed from his palm into the girl's body through her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within five minutes, the girl's complexion gradually began to improve, and her previously feeble breathing grew stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps because the girl's attendants didn't take Marcus' treatment seriously, no one noticed when she awoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nathaniel, where am I?" The blonde-haired, blue-eyed girl opened her eyes, appearing very puzzled, as though she couldn't recall what had </span><span>happene</span><span>d earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing her voice, Nathaniel Franklin, the bearded man, turned his head with a look of astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're finally awake! That's a miracle!" he exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The faces of the people beside him were delighted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never anticipated that a passing young man could save their master.</span></p></div>
