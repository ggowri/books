        <h1>Chapter 152 Formal Challenge</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus rushed back to Bayside Villa </span><span>in</span><span> a moment and dove straight into training with the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire. He had now reached Ancient Martial Stage Three, marking a significant improvement in his strength compared to before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he was at Ancient Martial Stage Two, he had already mastered the ability of energy manifestation. However, with his wide array of combat techniques, he had never needed to use it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Marcus had advanced to Ancient Martial Stage Three, a minor achievement stage, his energy manifestation was more fearsome than ever. A single punch could channel Numinous Energy into an overwhelming destructive power that struck out from him like a force of nature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, his mastery of the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire had progressed considerably, hinting at an imminent breakthrough to the third tier. If he succeeded, he would unlock a brand-new reward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first two rewards&mdash;X-ray vision and Celestial Reversal&mdash;had already proven highly effective in battle. Naturally, Marcus was eager to discover what awaited him in the third tier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the members of Serpent's Coil had also made strides in their understanding of the Magic Codex. Most of them had become proficient in the techniques outlined within it. Among them, Jalen had not only mastered the Magic Codex but also learned two powerful spells: Fireball and Lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through days of relentless study and practice, Jalen had ascended to the strength of a Stage One Wizard, becoming the strongest member of Serpent's Coil. When he wielded magic, his power was overwhelming, like a crushing force against ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Additionally, the magic squad, composed of nine exceptionally talented individuals, was beginning to take shape. Like Jalen, they had all learned Fireball and Lightning. While their power was slightly inferior to Jalen's, any one of them was still far beyond the capability of a normal person to handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edgar, whose physique was unsuited for magic cultivation, was instead taught an Ancient Martial Art by Marcus. Determined not to slack off, Edgar spent all his time immersed in studying the practice method. Though he had yet to fully master the art, he had made enough progress to possess a decent level of combat ability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, even without increasing their numbers, the combat strength of Serpent's Coil had undergone a dramatic transformation. Outwardly, they still appeared to be a typical gang, but in truth, they were rapidly becoming a force of budding Wizards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Currently, Marcus controlled two of Solomia's three major underground organizations: Serpent's Coil and the Death Syndicate. To outsiders, however, the two groups still appeared as separate entities with no apparent connection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last of the three major organizations, </span><span>Bloodspire</span><span> Order, remained autonomous. They had long been at odds with Serpent's Coil, with frequent clashes over territory. Recently, skirmishes had escalated as both sides vied for control of the northern port area, resulting in casualties on both sides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader of the </span><span>Bloodspire</span><span> Order had issued a formal challenge to Serpent's Coil, proposing a decisive battle three days later at an abandoned factory near the northern port.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edgar received the challenge letter and let out a sneer. "Dante, that old fool, really doesn't know his limits, does he? A final battle with us? What a joke."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the Serpent's Coil elders cautioned, "Dante may be a half-level warrior, but if </span><span>he's making such a bold move, he's probably well-prepared. Master, you mustn't underestimate him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Jalen stepped forward confidently and said, "A half-level warrior? That's nothing to worry about. With your permission, I'll personally lead a team to the abandoned factory at the northern port and bring back Dante's head."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edgar's gaze shifted to Jalen, studying him for a moment. Then Edgar said, "Fine. In three days, you'll take a thousand of our men to meet Dante and his crew."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jalen smirked, dismissing the suggestion with a wave of his hand. "There's no need for so many people. Nine members from the magic division will be enough." The room fell silent. Everyone in the Cyan Serpent Lodge was stunned. No one had expected Jalen to be so brazen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edgar gave him a long, probing look. "Are you sure about this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jalen nodded without hesitation. "Don't worry, Master. If I fail to kill Dante, I'll accept any punishment under our code." Seeing Jalen's unwavering determination, Edgar reluctantly agreed with a nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, most members of the Serpent's Coil had no idea how far Jalen had advanced in his magic training, and many began to worry for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The day of the battle between the Serpent's Coil and the </span><span>Bloodspire</span><span> Order came quickly. Jalen and his nine companions arrived at the designated location as planned. On the other side, Dante's forces numbered a thousand strong. The sheer size of their army was overwhelming, both in numbers and morale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dante Rourke let out a mocking laugh, convinced that Serpent's Coil sending ten people to the meeting was a death wish. But as the battle began, the reality was nothing like what he had expected.</span></p></div>
