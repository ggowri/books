  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Morgana stepped forward and grabbed Marcus, not wanting him to clash with Faith's man.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A nearby neighbor also spoke up to dissuade him, "Young man, I know the man Faith is seeing now. His name is Aidan, a gang leader in the area with dozens of men under him. He's not only powerful but also extremely ruthless!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Earlier, I heard that Aidan took a liking to a female college student. She had a boyfriend, so there was a conflict. In the end, Aidan not only cut off the boyfriend's limbs but also raped the college student in public, then handed her over to his men for gang rape."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The female college student's boyfriend could only watch helplessly as it all happened. In the end, the college student chose to commit suicide because she couldn't bear the humiliation."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This incident caused quite a stir at the time, even alerting the police. But shockingly, the police colluded with Aidan and completely ignored the matter."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, I think you'd better leave here quickly and hide."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus frowned upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his understanding, Serpent's Coil had already unified Solomia's underground world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't expect other small underground gangs to still be active in this area and so brazen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If what this neighbor said is true, then this Aidan is truly worse than a beast.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Marcus's Serpent's Coil and Axe Gang were also underground organizations, from the moment he took control of them, he strictly forbade his subordinates from oppressing ordinary people. Once discovered, severe punishment was mandatory.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this Aidan was even worse; he raped women and killed others at will.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Morgana, is what this neighbor said true?" Marcus couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Morgana nodded. She had heard about this before, so she didn't want Marcus to clash with Aidan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In that case, I must take care of this!" Seeing Morgana nod in confirmation, a cold glint immediately flashed in Marcus's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he walked, he sent a message to Jalen, asking him to bring some Serpent's Coil members over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For Aidan, who excelled at using violence to oppress ordinary people, Marcus decided to fight violence with violence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching Marcus's figure descending the stairs, a trace of worry flashed in Morgana's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although she knew Marcus was exceptionally capable and could even mobilize people from the city's police squad, at this moment, he was about to face a thug like Aidan. Morgana was genuinely worried that something might go wrong, which could drag Marcus down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Marcus dare to go downstairs despite knowing Aidan's reputation, some neighbors curiously followed behind, wanting to see what gave this young man such confidence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Faith had already found Aidan and exaggeratedly recounted what she had experienced.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, Aidan had more than just Faith as a woman.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He maintained a relationship with Faith solely because her curvy figure satisfied his preference for mature women.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But no matter what, Faith was still Aidan's woman, and now she had been insulted and beaten. If he chose to ignore it, word would spread, and he feared becoming a laughingstock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone, grab your stuff! Let's take that kid down and show him that my woman isn't someone anyone can mess with!" Aidan roared, and dozens of people immediately sprang into action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They grabbed machetes, jumped into several black SUVs, and, under Faith's guidance, headed straight to the neighborhood where Morgana lived.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Marcus had come downstairs not long ago, Aidan arrived with his crew.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The black SUVs aggressively parked in the neighborhood courtyard, scaring the surrounding neighbors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They knew the ruthlessness of the underworld and began to worry for Marcus.</span></p><div class="pagination">
