  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the car's departing back, the students passing by the school gate all cast envious glances at it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't that Melina? Melina left with a strange man. That man is so happy. I envy him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Melina is my goddess. I dream of sitting in her Ferrari, but it seems like there's no chance now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you thinking? Ordinary people like us shouldn't dream about this. Girls like Melina are not someone like us can get."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several male classmates talked about it with envy on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't know all this. He was sitting in the passenger seat of Melina's car, smelling the faint fragrance coming from her body, and felt surprisingly peaceful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I've always wanted to know what your relationship with Natalia is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina asked Marcus while driving, her long eyelashes fluttering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm his sister's husband."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus answered casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I think Natalia's feelings towards you are more like a lover. Maybe my feelings are wrong..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina continued to ask tentatively, occasionally looking at Marcus with a hint of expectation in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like she was expecting Marcus to give a negative answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus remained silent and did not answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina realized that her words were inappropriate, and she quickly said, "Oh, I just like gossip, but I don't have any bad intentions. Don't mind it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Naturally, he knew Melina's thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as she said, she had no bad intentions, which made Marcus not so </span><span>disgusted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two found a restaurant and ordered a few exquisite dishes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They enjoyed the pleasure brought by delicious food under the soothing music.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this period, Melina asked Marcus a few more questions, and he answered all he could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, he felt that the way Melina looked at him was gradually changing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As someone who had been through this, Marcus naturally understood what Melina was thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't point it out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, bursts of violent engine roars were heard outside the restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The originally quiet atmosphere was destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people in the restaurant looked out the window and saw several brightly colored super sports cars driving into the restaurant's parking lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all with top luxury brands such as Lamborghini, Ferrari, McLaren, Pagani, Aston Martin...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cars stopped, and many young people in their 20s, dressed in hip-hop fashion brands, got out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These people, both men and women, were dressed very fashionably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They walked into the restaurant and went straight to the table where Marcus and Melina were sitting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Melina, why didn't you answer the phone? It took us so long to find you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A blond girl with many ear piercings said to Melina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina looked annoyed when she saw them and said, "I've already said that I quit. Why are you still looking for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A boy in a green sweatshirt said, "Didn't you say before that we are a team? Now you quit so easily, do you still care about us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, no matter who quits, you can't quit. Melina, you have to keep your word!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another purple-haired girl said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judging from their attire and the cars they drove, they should all be born in rich families in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus guessed what these people's so-called circle was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina glanced at these people and asked, "So what do you want? If you have any requests, please make them immediately. Don't disturb me and Mr. Fitzgerald from having dinner!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she said this, she successfully attracted the attention of these young people to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The boy in the green sweatshirt frowned and sneered at Melina, "Who is this guy? You didn't contact us because of him? He looks so rustic, is it worth it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The boy in the green sweatshirt must be jealous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always liked Melina and had been pursuing her for two or three years, but she had always refused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he naturally couldn't stand it when he suddenly saw Melina having dinner with a man who was not as good as him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the boy in the green sweatshirt talking like that, Melina became even angrier. She slammed the table and stood up, saying, "Mr. Fitzgerald is much better than you, John. You better speak properly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Melina glanced at everyone again and said solemnly, "I'll say it again. I'm quitting the circle. Don't come to me anymore."</span></p><div class="pagination">
