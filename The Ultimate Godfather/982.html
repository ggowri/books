  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus took Kiera to a luxury neighborhood in Solomia, where they purchased a big river-view penthouse. They chose the Phoenix Level, which was the top unit of the entire building&mdash;arguably the most expensive in the complex, and it came fully furnished and move-in ready.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the building materials to the contractors and architects, everything about this place was top-tier. The apartment was valued at 58 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the payment was made, Kiera received the keys immediately. After a quick purchase of home additional items, she was all set to move in. Marcus arranged everything through his men, meaning that, technically, by this time tomorrow, Kiera could be living in her new home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon receiving the keys, Kiera couldn't contain her happiness and even shed a few tears. Before this, she would never have imagined that one day she'd be living in such a luxurious riverside penthouse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The residents of this building were among the most influential people in Solomia, and now Kiera was their neighbor&mdash;a truly meteoric rise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, Marcus bought Kiera a car. Although Kiera had a driver's license, she had always been hesitant to drive due to her limited skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, decided to get her a Porsche 718. The car had great performance and was small enough to be easy to park and handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the move, Marcus handed the task over to Darian Baird.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darian, now the owner of a logistics company, had plenty of employees, and a few of them were more than capable of handling the move smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With all these arrangements made, Marcus said his goodbyes to Kiera, saying he had other business to attend to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vroom, vroom&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Marcus was driving back toward Bayside Villa, an overwhelming aura suddenly swept through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a terrifying force, and it quickly enveloped the area around him&mdash;his car was completely covered by it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow, instantly realizing that someone had come looking for trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly turned the car around and drove toward the mountainous area near the coastline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Marcus reached a road near the mountain's summit and parked at a junction. He got out of the car, and as he did, the aura remained focused on his vehicle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Marcus stepped out, a beam of light appeared out of nowhere. It seemed like a door to another space, and through it, a figure emerged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus immediately recognized the glowing door as a higher-level spatial spell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The figure who stepped through the portal was a young woman wearing a white chiffon dress. She was tall, with fair skin and delicate features, exuding an ethereal, almost otherworldly aura&mdash;definitely a top-tier beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon closer inspection, Marcus noticed that her facial features seemed strikingly similar to Ada.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you, and why are you using your aura to lock onto me?" Marcus asked, his eyes scanning the woman as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the way she carried herself, Marcus could tell she had reached the Ancient Martial Stage Nine, a level of cultivation that made her a top-tier expert in the world of Ancient Martial Arts in Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You must be Marcus Fitzgerald," the woman said coldly, raising her eyebrows. "I'm Silvia, the cousin of the Ada. I heard from my cousin that you violated her and forcibly took her as your woman. Is that true?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow slightly, surprised to learn that this woman was the cousin of Ada.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder the two women shared some similar features. However, upon closer inspection, there were still considerable differences. Ada had a even more otherworldly, celestial beauty, while the woman before him, though equally graceful, exuded a softer, more feminine charm.</span></p><div class="pagination">
