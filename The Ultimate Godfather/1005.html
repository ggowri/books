  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Yasser's words, Gertie felt as if the man before her had become a complete stranger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Gertie's heart, Yasser had always been a gentleman, polite, and refined, except for that one moment of natural physical desire half a month ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, after she had been violated by that scoundrel, Yasser, her boyfriend, showed no sympathy or understanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he blamed her entirely and hurled filthy insults at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This left Gertie utterly disillusioned with Yasser. Tears streamed down her face as she said, "I told you, losing my purity wasn't my choice. I was forced by that scoundrel. I had no power to resist him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know how helpless I felt? I wish you could have been there to protect me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I had to face it alone. I know I'm no longer pure, so I stepped aside, knowing I'm no longer worthy of marrying you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Instead of understanding or comforting me, you say these things to me. Yasser, you've truly let me down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But maybe it's for the best. Since there's no future for us, let's just end it here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser looked at Gertie with disdain in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth and said, "Shut up, you slut. I don't need your explanations. Even if you didn't refuse to marry me, I'd never want a used-up whore like you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you dare call yourself a victim? That's laughable. You're in the Ancient Martial Stage Nine. How many people in the world of Ancient Martial Art could even challenge you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aside from those reclusive old monsters, there aren't many who could match you. And that guy was clearly just a kid in his early twenties. I don't believe he could've succeeded unless you let him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, and you two were in that illusion rune for so long. You must've enjoyed it, you slut! I was such a fool to protect you all these years. I must've been blind!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser's words grew harsher and harsher. In his eyes, Gertie was nothing but a shameless whore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was convinced she had willingly given herself to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie couldn't hold back and slapped Yasser across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Yasser, you've gone too far. Even after being violated, I still have my dignity. I won't let anyone trample on it, so watch your mouth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You slut! How dare you talk to me like that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that's how it is, don't blame me for being ruthless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Yasser triggered the family alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This alarm summoned the strongest members of the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, after the alarm sounded, the senior members of the Tucker family, who had been at the banquet, arrived one after another, including Yasser's father, Brett, the family patriarch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yasser, what's going on?" Brett asked his son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had only been a few minutes since Gertie left, yet the couple was now at each other's throats. This left Brett somewhat puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Gertie had rejected the marriage proposal, Yasser's temperament shouldn't have led to such hostility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet it seemed they had just had a fierce argument. So fierce that Yasser had sounded the family alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Father, this slut refused to marry me because she's been fooling around with some scoundrel. She's already given her purity to him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is a disgrace to our Tucker family. This whore must pay a heavy price!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I suggest we capture her, throw her into the family dungeon, and torture her to death!" Yasser spoke through gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, all tenderness he once had for Gertie was gone, replaced by pure hatred and rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his eyes, he was the ultimate fool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had guarded her for decades, only for her to give herself to some stranger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how patient Yasser was, he couldn't endure this humiliation. He had completely snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words caused an uproar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the senior members of the Tucker family cast scornful gazes at Gertie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never imagined that this woman, known as one of the two most chaste heroines in the world of Ancient Martial Art, could be so fickle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she had betrayed the young master of the Tucker family. Murderous glares were directed at her from all sides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brett's body radiated with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes turned sharp, filled with murderous intent. "I never thought you'd be such a fickle slut. Our Tucker family misjudged you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie scanned the Tucker family members. She never expected things would come to this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although her cultivation had reached the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Nine, she was no match for the combined strength of the Tucker family's experts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie didn't bother explaining further. She knew the Tucker family would only believe Yasser, no matter what she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seize this slut! Throw her into the dungeon, as Yasser suggested, and await further punishment!" Brett's voice rang out, cold and commanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The senior members of the Tucker family surged forward, attacking Gertie together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how strong Gertie was, she stood no chance against them all. She was quickly subdued and thrown into the dungeon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yasser, do you know who that scoundrel who took Gertie is?" After Gertie was imprisoned, Brett asked Yasser.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser said, "He's in Solomia and barely in his twenties. I couldn't gauge his cultivation, but at his age, he can't be that strong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brett's eyes gleamed with a cold light as he said, "No matter how strong he is, he's offended the dignity of the Tucker family. We must tear him to pieces!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His father's words aligned perfectly with Yasser's own desires.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His woman had been taken by another man. If Yasser didn't make a statement by killing that scoundrel himself, he'd become a laughingstock in the world of Ancient Martial Art.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, even if people called him a cuckold, he'd have no choice but to endure it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he did nothing after his woman was taken, he deserved the scorn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking this, Yasser decided to lead a team of experts to Solomia and kill Marcus himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brett supported the plan. "I'll have the Four Guardians accompany you to Solomia. Bring that scoundrel back if you can. I'll personally interrogate him and mete out the harshest punishment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser nodded, and the Four Guardians stepped forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their cultivation was above Ancient Martial Stage Nine, and each possessed exceptional combat strength, capable of challenging opponents beyond their level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Brett's eyes, with the Four Guardians and Yasser going together, success was guaranteed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In my opinion, we should proceed with caution. We mustn't act rashly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a dissenting voice came from nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser and Brett turned to see an elderly man with white hair and beard approaching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the old man who had accompanied Yasser to Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean?" Brett asked, a hint of surprise on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In my view, though the young man is young, he's likely extremely dangerous. The illusion rune he set up was not only profound but of a type I'd never seen before. I fear acting rashly could bring unnecessary trouble to the Tucker family," the white-haired old man spoke gravely.</span></p><div class="pagination">
