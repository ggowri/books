  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others' gazes fell on Marcus, filled with teasing expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were also curious whether Marcus could handle the situation with composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Marcus did not pay any attention to Nolan's provocation. He poured the second bottle of </span><span>Everclear</span><span> into his glass and drank it down in one go, performing the action with grace and ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After swallowing the second bottle of </span><span>Everclear</span><span>, Marcus couldn't help but let out a loud burp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't drunk. Even drinking that much water would make anyone feel bloated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people did not expect this reckless youth Marcus to really down two bottles of </span><span>Everclear</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he was showing signs of struggling toward the end, his alcohol tolerance had already surpassed that of the vast majority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Marcus simply could not be compared to Nolan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan was known for never getting Drunk. For Nolan, two bottles of </span><span>Everclear</span><span> didn't even count as an appetizer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus burping and looking somewhat strained, Nolan showed a triumphant look and said, "Your alcohol tolerance indeed exceeds that of most ordinary people. But two bottles of </span><span>Everclear</span><span> should be your limit. If I down one more, you lose. Haha."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he said this, Nolan prepared to finish Marcus off with one more drink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he opened the third bottle of </span><span>Everclear</span><span> and gulped it down, making sure to cast a challenging glance at Marcus afterward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people applauded Nolan while looking at Marcus, waiting to see him make a fool of himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you see it? Three bottles of </span><span>Everclear</span><span> are like mouthwash for me. I advise you to surrender now. Otherwise, you'll only humiliate yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan wiped his mouth and arrogantly looked at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure that's enough to gargle with </span><span>Everclear</span><span>?" Marcus sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even thirty bottles wouldn't be a big deal." Nolan laughed heartily, full of pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when Nolan prepared to utilize his techniques to resolve the alcohol from this new bottle, he felt an invisible binding force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This Binding Force enveloped him without warning, making him feel as if his entire body was shackled by some kind of restraint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what technique he tried, nothing worked. All his skills seemed to be malfunctioning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan felt a burning pain in his stomach as the alcohol was being absorbed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His head spun, and his complexion turned flushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's happening? Why is this happening? Why can't my techniques operate? What is going on?" Nolan thought, instinctively holding his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He attempted to use his techniques again, but it was futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Channeling energy only accelerated the absorption, making his head spin even more, and he was starting to show signs of drunkenness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, to prevent the crowd from noticing anything unusual, Nolan gritted his teeth and persisted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Nolan like this, Marcus couldn't help but smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As an Acquired State expert, dealing with someone at Stage Two was a piece of cake for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, he opened the third bottle of </span><span>Everclear</span><span> and downed it in one go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Marcus didn't stop and poured the fourth bottle of </span><span>Everclear</span><span> into the beer mug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene made the audience gasp in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Nolan saw double before his eyes, and his stomach roiled violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus finish the third bottle of </span><span>Everclear</span><span> without issue and then open the fourth, his heart sank to the bottom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He began to strategize how to cleverly withdraw from this competition, knowing that otherwise, he would surely lose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before Nolan could speak, Marcus had already finished the fourth bottle of </span><span>Everclear</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene not only stunned everyone present but even shocked Melina immensely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never expected Marcus to be able to handle so much alcohol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't care about the crowd's scrutiny and turned to Nolan, saying, "It's your turn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan's face turned ashen, and his gaze toward Marcus became cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through gritted teeth, he said, "I just wanted to test your alcohol tolerance. You are indeed impressive. But for Melina's sake, I think we don't need to continue. I don't want you to lose too embarrassingly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Nolan felt his stomach start to cramp, and he almost vomited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he concealed it well. Aside from his slightly flushed face, outsiders did not notice anything wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, everyone thought Nolan had rare compassion for his opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The audience thought, "Marcus should seize this opportunity and quickly leave with </span><span>Melina. If Nolan changes his mind, he will definitely make Marcus drink himself to the hospital."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you claiming that five bottles of </span><span>Everclear</span><span> are just your mouthwash? How can you back out now? I've already finished the fourth bottle. If you don't want to drink, then immediately kneel down and beg for mercy, and apologize to Melina. Then I will allow you to withdraw."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when everyone thought Marcus would take this opportunity to leave, he instead provoked Nolan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people froze in place, their eyes filled with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They even thought they had misheard or were hallucinating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "Marcus is too arrogant. Nolan gave him a chance to leave, and he didn't treasure it. He will surely pay for his actions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the crowd thought this, Nolan's face turned an ominous shade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More and more alcohol </span><span>was</span><span> being absorbed, spreading through his bloodstream, causing his head to spin even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet he gritted his teeth and insisted, saying to Marcus, "You bastard, what nonsense are you talking? You better recognize your place. You could never be my opponent. If you keep insisting, you might put your life in danger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, completely ignored Nolan's words. He opened a bottle of </span><span>Everclear</span><span> and poured it into Nolan's beer mug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said, "The drink is ready. If you want to quit, beg for mercy right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone directed extremely sarcastic gazes at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never expected Marcus to be so overconfident, thinking, "Nolan despises competing with him, yet he believes Nolan is afraid of him. It's simply ridiculous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan gritted his teeth as he spoke to Marcus. "I told </span><span>you,</span><span> I'm not interested in competing with you anymore. This contest ends here. I have no time to waste with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To avoid embarrassing himself, Nolan stood up from his seat, preparing to leave the private room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus stepped forward and pressed Nolan's shoulder, forcefully keeping him seated. Then he raised the beer mug filled with </span><span>Everclear</span><span> and brought it to Nolan's lips.</span></p><div class="pagination">
