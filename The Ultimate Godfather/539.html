        <h1>Chapter 538 Exploitation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden remark felt completely out of place, drawing curious stares from the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund frowned, glancing over at Lila with a look of disdain. "There's no reason. I just think Tina is better suited for the role."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the head of Stellar Entertainment, Edmund had the power to call the shots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could make or break any star, and he could easily elevate an unknown face to superstardom overnight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Lila wasn't backing down. "We signed a contract, Mr. Cross. I was supposed to be the headliner, performing three songs. You're breaking the contract, and I have the right to demand compensation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This event had been hyped for months, attracting major industry attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the scheduled headliner, being replaced at the last minute was not just a professional blow. It could seriously harm Lila's career.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was furious and prepared to fight for her rights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund smirked. "Don't worry. You'll get every penny you're owed. It should be in your account by now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost as if on cue, Lila's phone buzzed with a message alert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She checked it. A deposit of 200 thousand dollars had just been made.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face twisted in frustration. "Mr. Cross, why is it only 200 thousand dollars? The contract clearly states I'm entitled to 600 thousand for three songs. And since you're in breach, I'm also owed 300 thousand in penalties. That's 900 thousand total. What's going on here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund laughed coldly. "The 600 thousand was for three songs. You only sang one, so you get 200 thousand. And as for penalties, we don't do penalties at Stellar Entertainment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can take the 200 thousand or leave it. If you don't want it, feel free to return it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The conversation was getting heated, and soon, the crowd below took notice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many, including Marcus, were quickly piecing together what had happened and began to speak out on Lila's behalf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that Stellar Entertainment was pulling a fast one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had initially promised Lila 600 thousand to perform as the headliner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had agreed, and the company used her name to fill the venue with her fans, meeting their attendance goals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But once she arrived, they changed the plan, slashing her performance down to one song and offering her just a third of the agreed fee. It was beyond shameful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Cross is offering you 200 thousand, and you're still complaining?" Tina sneered as she walked over, her voice dripping with sarcasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're nothing more than a flashy internet celebrity. There are thousands like you, rising to fame quickly, then fading just as fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And now, you have the nerve to criticize Mr. Cross? You should be thanking him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for me, I've got an education from a prestigious music academy, while you? You're just a joke."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina had been jealous of Lila's overnight rise to fame for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had tried countless times to surpass her but always failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, being able to take Lila's spot as the headliner felt like the sweetest revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're going too far!" Lila's voice shook with anger. "I'll take legal action against you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew this wasn't just some petty dispute. It ran deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the president of Stellar Entertainment, Edmund's exploitation of female stars was an open secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd made several advances toward Lila before, but she had firmly turned him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Humiliated and enraged, Edmund had turned to Tina, who had gladly accepted his offers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was nothing more than revenge on Lila for rejecting him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Lila could continue, Tina stepped forward and slapped her hard across the face, her eyes gleaming with malice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can take down Mr. Cross? Do you know who's behind him? The powerful Burnett family in Kingston. Know your place. Take your 200 thousand and leave quietly. One word from Mr. Cross, and your career is over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund stood there, arms crossed, watching Lila with a smug grin.</span></p></div>
