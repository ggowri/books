  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This place was home to many of Uswad's Ancient Martial Art families, a kind of hidden sanctuary, far removed from the outside world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they entered, Yasser couldn't help but have a subtle yet cold sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Marcus had effortlessly wiped out the Four Guardians, and Yasser himself was no match for him, he still couldn't believe this guy had the audacity to enter the Tucker Estate alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Tucker family wasn't just any powerful family. It was one of the most influential Ancient Martial Art families in Uswad, with deep roots and three powerful Grandmasters watching over it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' entrance here was nothing short of a death sentence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser was certain that Marcus wouldn't survive much longer. The three Grandmasters would deal with him swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was almost laughable how cocky this guy was, acting so fearless in front of him. Clearly, he didn't know what kind of danger he was walking into.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where's the dungeon? Take me there," Marcus said coldly, gripping Yasser's shoulder with an ironclad hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the three Grandmasters arrived, Yasser knew better than to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He led Marcus to the entrance of the dungeon, where two Tucker guards stood watch. As soon as they saw Yasser under Marcus' control, they reached for their weapons, ready to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before they could even react, Marcus flicked his left index finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, two streaks of blinding light shot out, piercing through the guards' foreheads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They fell to the ground without a sound, their bodies lifeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser's breath caught in his throat. Watching Marcus take out two men with such ease was unsettling. It was as if he was swatting flies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The calmness that radiated from Marcus only made the situation more terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could he really be powerful enough to challenge the entire Tucker family?" Yasser thought but quickly dismissed the idea. "But in front of the three Grandmasters, Marcus will be nothing more than an insect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dispatching the two guards with a casual flick of his finger, Marcus approached the dungeon's heavy gates and pushed them open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The foul stench of decay hit him like a wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dungeon was dark and oppressive. They descended several flights of stairs, quickly reaching an area deep underground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The walls were lined with cages made from special steel, each holding a high-profile prisoner from the Tucker family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Years of confinement had taken a heavy toll on the prisoners, many of whom had lost their grip on reality. Some screamed and raged, wild-eyed and out of control, while others huddled in the corners, shaking in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few were so terrified that they wet themselves, babbling nonsensically as their minds cracked under the pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser led Marcus deeper into the dungeon, stopping in front of a massive stone pillar at the center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This pillar was reserved for the Tucker family's most dangerous criminals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tied to the pillar, barely clinging to life, was Gertie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body was covered in wounds, and it was clear she was on the verge of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she heard footsteps approaching, she weakly opened her eyes, only to see two figures walking toward her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her vision was clouded from the pain and dehydration, and she could barely make out their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as the figures drew closer, her eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she finally saw the tall, handsome figure of Marcus, her face froze in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus... What are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't believe it. Of all places, for him to show up here, in the depths of the Tucker family dungeon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a forbidden area, a place only the highest-ranking members of the Tucker family could enter.</span></p><div class="pagination">
