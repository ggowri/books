  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Scales said, "At least three million dollars." While speaking, he glanced at Marcus with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Scales didn't believe that Marcus could have Aston Martin. Judging from Marcus' outfit and temperament, he didn't look like a rich man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing the price, Sheila and Betsy were surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sheila said, "It is so expensive. Is it much more expensive than your BMW X7? How can Catherine's boyfriend afford it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betsy nodded. "Anyone who can drive a car worth more than three million dollars must have at least tens of millions or even hundreds of millions. If Catherine's boyfriend was really that rich, she couldn't have come to this party."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Scales smiled at Betsy and said, "The boss I will introduce to you has a Bentley, which costs more than three million dollars. You will have a luxurious car in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betsy immediately became excited. "Really? Is the man that rich?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Scales said, "He's worth about 200 to 300 million dollars. Anyway, I'm not as rich as him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The more Betsy listened, the more excited she became, and she even started imagining that she was a wealthy lady now. Her gaze gradually became arrogant as she looked at Marcus and Catherine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betsy whispered to Catherine, "Catherine, let Scales introduce you to someone better than your boyfriend. You are beautiful. What is the purpose of living a lifetime? Don't you want to enjoy a wealthy life?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catherine frowned and smiled awkwardly, "Thank you, Betsy, but my relationship with Marcus is good. I won't break up with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betsy pressed her lips, seeming not to understand Catherine's thoughts. She thought, "In this materialistic society, who doesn't want to marry a rich man?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betsy didn't want to say anymore. She was sure that Catherine would regret it one day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus heard what Betsy and Catherine said, but he didn't bother to explain. He just wanted to accompany Catherine to attend this party and leave as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sheila whispered to Betsy, "Forget it, Betsy. Catherine has had different ideas from us since she was a child. Her parents seem to have the same idea, so they still live such an ordinary life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they talked, they passed by Scales' brand-new BMW X7. Although it was night, the car paint still sparkled under the flashing neon lights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betsy was full of envy. She couldn't help but exclaim, "What a nice car! The luxury car looks pretty good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Betsy turned to look at Marcus and said, "You should work hard and buy a nice car. Catherine loves you so much. Don't let Catherine suffer with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus smiled indifferently, not bothering to explain. A few of them had no idea that Marcus' Aston Martin was worth more than six million dollars, which was like pocket money for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They went upstairs soon. A total of a dozen classmates had agreed to attend today's party, and the organizer booked a spacious and luxurious private room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The classmates hadn't seen each other for more than ten years. When they got together again, they talked happily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They looked very intimate on the surface, but they were actually comparing with each other in jobs, education, wealth, partners, and so on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among them, Sheila was the most enviable one among a dozen classmates. Her boyfriend, Scales, had basically made a fortune of over 100 million dollars thanks to his work in the medical equipment installation and maintenance industry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many female classmates looked at Sheila with envy and flattered her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In addition to Sheila, Catherine was also the focus of people's attention because she had been the most beautiful girl in the class.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When they were about to enter junior high school, some precocious students had already had the boys they liked and had started paying great attention to their appearance and outfits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, because of the family condition, Catherine couldn't afford nice clothes. However, she was still the most beautiful girl in the class.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Catherine, those people in the private room found that she was even more beautiful than when she was in elementary school. Her appearance was comparable to those of the stars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all the dishes were served, Sheila suddenly stood up, glanced at everyone, and spoke, "We haven't seen each other for more than ten years. I'm happy to see you all today, so I'll pay for the meal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing this, some classmates applauded and gave Sheila a thumbs-up. They said, "Sheila is rich now. She is so generous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course, her boyfriend is worth tens of millions. Treating us to a meal is no big deal to him!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
