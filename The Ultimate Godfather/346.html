        <h1>Chapter 345 You're fired!</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sync Group is still in its early stages, and we cannot afford to have power-abusers or freeloaders using personal connections to secure jobs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to keep your position as the branch manager, I suggest you immediately fire this woman. And as for your niece, she has no place at Sync Group either."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words immediately drew the attention of everyone, all eyes now fixed on Victoria and Gloria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two women turned pale, their faces darkening, but they dared not speak, afraid of provoking Leif's wrath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leif's gaze flickered for a moment before he chuckled. "Mr. Fitzgerald, it's true that you're an honored guest of Sync Group, but that doesn't mean you have the right to interfere in my company's internal affairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My wife and niece are both people I personally appointed. As the company's general manager, I have the right to make those decisions," he continued with a sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And Mr. Andrade has fully supported my appointments. What right do you, an outsider, have to question them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I strongly suggest you know your place, or you might just end up shooting yourself in the foot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victoria and Gloria felt a wave of relief wash over them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leif's words were validating&mdash;they agreed that Marcus, despite being a guest of the company, had overstepped by getting involved in the company's management.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never understood how someone like him became an honored guest," Victoria said, her tone dripping with scorn. "I think it's time you escorted him out, darling. Mr. Andrade knows what he's done, and I'm sure he won't hold it against you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gloria nodded enthusiastically, eager to see Marcus thrown out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leif smirked. He then turned back to Marcus, his voice colder now. "Mr. Fitzgerald, I showed you respect earlier, but it seems you've crossed the line. Don't mistake my courtesy for weakness. If you continue down this path, I won't hesitate to show you the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, no one, not even Mr. Andrade, can remove my wife or niece from their positions at Sync Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd buzzed with whispers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People were starting to think that Marcus was meddling in affairs that didn't concern him&mdash;asserting himself where he had no place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Sync Group had treated him like a distinguished guest, providing him with the highest level of hospitality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The branch manager himself had come down to greet him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, here he was, overstepping boundaries, directly interfering in the company's internal matters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was laughable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? In that case, I'll just fire Stephen Andrade along with them!" Marcus said with a sudden smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he walked off to the side and made a call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the room went dead silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many of them thought they had misheard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This guy was claiming he was going to fire Stephen Andrade?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he out of his mind?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephen Andrade was the CEO of Sync Group, the most influential figure in the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who did Marcus think he was, making such an outrageous statement?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leif, Victoria, and Gloria couldn't hold back their laughter, their eyes filled with mockery as they looked at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Country bumpkin," Gloria said, still chuckling. "I didn't think you'd actually be this insane. Your words are getting more and more ridiculous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First, you tried to fire Victoria and me and failed. Now you're saying you'll fire Mr. Andrade?" She continued, her voice laced with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you even know who Mr. Andrade is? What makes you think you have the authority to make such a claim? You're just a joke!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victoria, still laughing, added, "Gloria, this guy clearly has mental issues. And your friend Catherine must have problems too if she's hanging out with him. You should stay far away from people like him&mdash;don't let anyone think you're as crazy as he is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gloria nodded eagerly, agreeing with every word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leif shook his head, clearly amused, but his expression turned sharper as he addressed Marcus directly. "Mr. Fitzgerald, I'm curious&mdash;what gives you the authority to fire Mr. Andrade? Are you dreaming?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've heard of people living in a fantasy world, but I didn't believe it until now. Now I see it&mdash;I think you're the type of person who's completely lost in your own dream. Let's see how you plan to fire Mr. Andrade," Leif said, his voice dripping with sarcasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine, unable to watch any longer, shot Marcus a glance, silently urging him to back off and leave the situation before it got any worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus wasn't fazed. He turned to Leif with an unwavering expression and said, "In one minute, you'll receive a call telling you that Stephen has been fired."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At those words, Leif, Victoria, and Gloria all burst into laughter again, their amusement barely contained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were convinced now that Marcus was completely delusional.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as Leif opened his mouth to respond, his phone rang. It was an unfamiliar number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He instinctively picked up the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leif Leonard?" A cold, unfamiliar voice greeted him from the other end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leif, already irritated, responded curtly, "Yeah, it's me. What is it? I'm busy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm Troy from the Sync Group Board of Directors. Stephen has been dismissed, and everyone he appointed has lost their positions. I'm calling to inform you that you won't need to come in tomorrow. A new general manager will be replacing you."</span></p></div>
