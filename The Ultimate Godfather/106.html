  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To ensure his loved ones could protect themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus decided to pass down the ancient Magic Codex to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He first approached Charles and Yvonne's parents, then Michelle, Catherine, Jane, and Natalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shared the Magic Codex with each of them, teaching them how to harness their powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These people had been ordinary civilians before, completely unfamiliar with what it meant to be a Wizard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet they all showed keen interest and cooperated fully with Marcus, promising to master the Magic Codex within two weeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, Marcus visited his adoptive parents and sister, Nicole, sharing the Magic Codex with them in the same way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being older, Medeline and Richard weren't as quick to grasp new concepts as the younger folks. At first, they were skeptical about the very existence of witchcraft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only after Marcus demonstrated his powers did they fully believe and agree to start training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave them a more generous timeframe of one month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With everything arranged, he finally headed back to Bayside Villa, exhaustion weighing heavy on his shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as his car turned onto Bayside Avenue, two figures suddenly blocked his path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man and a woman stood before him, both radiating immense power. They were the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their auras clashed, one ice-cold, one blazing hot. When combined, these opposing forces created a devastating power far greater than the sum of its parts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting words, the duo launched their attack. Their combined ice and fire powers transformed into a destructive force, crashing down on the Alphard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A loud explosion rocked the air as the Alphard flipped violently before erupting into flames!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus was ready. He'd already leaped clear before the attack could connect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pair's cold eyes narrowed. They hadn't expected Marcus to be so quick. They immediately launched another fierce assault in his direction!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kid, you messed with the Kingston Browns. Time to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's voice dripped with menace, his sunken eyes giving him a nightmarish appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His flame attacks were potent, merging with the woman's ice aura to create an overwhelming force that bore down on Marcus like an avalanche.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of meeting it head-on, Marcus dodged with a swift movement, barely avoiding the dual assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In one fluid motion, he stepped forward and unleashed three rapid punches at the woman!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She realized Marcus had targeted all her weak points with frightening precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fight had barely begun when Marcus instantly spotted her weakness. This young man was clearly more formidable than expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did she know that Marcus possessed X-ray vision, allowing him to instantly identify vital weak points in his opponents with just a glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those three strikes had left the woman reeling, barely managing to deflect them, even with her male partner's support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got some nerve, kid, taking on both of us like this," she snarled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A murderous intent flashed in her eyes as she unleashed a devastating palm strike at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus stood his ground, meeting her attack head-on with a thunderous punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The collision of the fist and palm created an explosive impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman's face radiated confidence and arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd foolishly assumed her strike alone would be enough to match Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she hadn't counted on Marcus's punch not only packing tremendous power but also erupting with terrifying flames in its wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flames engulfed her like a tidal wave, consuming her entire body in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horror swept across her face as searing pain shot through her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing her dire situation, she desperately summoned her strongest ice powers to extinguish the flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she was already a mess, her skin badly scorched and blistered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're dead!" the man roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Enraged, he launched his fiery assault on Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus remained unfazed, unleashing another devastating punch to meet his opponent's attack head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through his grueling training regime, Marcus remained at the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Two, but his combat prowess had reached new heights entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His single punch sent his opponent staggering backward, and even the man's prized flame abilities proved useless against Marcus's overwhelming strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's face darkened as he attempted another attack on Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that precise moment, a terrifying bolt of lightning struck from above without warning!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lightning, packing over ten thousand volts, possessed devastating power and struck with unimaginable speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught completely off guard, the man had no time to react before the lightning blast hit him head-on!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a loud crack, the man's body convulsed violently. His eyes widened in shock as he stammered, "But... but you're supposed to be just a warrior... how can you use witchcraft...?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those were his final words before he collapsed, struck dead by Marcus's Lightning spell!</span></p><div class="pagination">
