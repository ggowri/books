  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had just teleported over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The teleportation had been a long one, leaving his head spinning and making him a bit disoriented. As a result, he wasn't able to dodge in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact wasn't light. If it had been an ordinary person, they'd likely be seriously hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus was an expert at Ancient Martial Stage Seven, so to him, it was more of a sharp sting, no real damage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn, that dude just got hit! Looks pretty rough. He should probably go to the hospital!" said one passer-by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a stunningly beautiful girl in chic, youthful clothing stepped out of a BMW three Series.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing she had hit </span><span>someone,</span><span> she immediately went into a panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rushed to help Marcus up, but instead of showing much remorse, she scolded him. "What's wrong with you? Don't you watch where you're walking? You just popped up like a ghost! I barely had time to hit the brakes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus blinked, his gaze flickering as he felt like he recognized her. After a moment, it hit him. "Wait, you're Lila Sassoon, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Marcus, the girl rolled her eyes and sighed. "I was trying to avoid being recognized, but of course, you spotted me. What a day..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila was the latest sensation in the music scene, a rising star in country music.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her songs had been skyrocketing online, with her name topping the charts on all the major streaming platforms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her music wasn't the only thing getting attention. Her fresh, youthful looks had turned her into a crush for many male fans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though she was still an online singer, Lila had quickly become a household name, known far and wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had been listening to her songs recently, captivated by her incredible voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never imagined he'd run into her in person, and certainly not in this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How are you feeling?" Lila asked, concerned. "If you're hurt, I'll call for an ambulance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he was partially at fault, she didn't want to shirk responsibility for hitting him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine," Marcus said, flashing a smile as he waved it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila quickly pulled a business card from her LV bag and handed it to him. "I'm in a rush, but if you need anything, you can contact me. I know you popped up out of nowhere, but since I hit you, I'll cover all the medical costs. Don't worry about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus took the card and casually slipped it into his pocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was about to refuse her offer to cover the expenses when she interrupted him. "Don't bother. Let me guess. You're thinking of using this as an excuse to get to know me, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'd advise you to forget it. We're just strangers who happened to cross paths. Sure, I hit you, but I'll take care of the medical fees. There are a ton of guys out there trying to get close to me, and trust me. You're not the first. I really don't have the time for </span><span>this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've got a performance to get to, and I'm already running late. I'll be on my way now. If you need anything, just call."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Lila hopped back into her car and drove off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a rising star, and the attention she was getting from male fans, some of them powerful, wealthy heirs, was overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew exactly what they were after, and she had no interest in entertaining them. Anyone trying to get close to her was met with a quick rejection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, in her eyes, Marcus was just another guy trying to use this encounter to get into her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He probably planned the whole thing, staging the accident as a way to get close to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling a bit bored, she didn't even give him a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The phone number she'd given him was just a backup, nothing more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he needed money for medical expenses, she'd send it after her performance. But as for anything else, it was impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus shook his head with a rueful smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected Lila to mistake him for just another brainless fan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't really mind. In fact, he kind of respected her for taking responsibility so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he was being honest, he knew the accident was partly his fault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't teleported right into the middle of the road, she wouldn't have hit him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to him, this was nothing more than a minor blip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shrugging it off, he flagged a taxi and headed toward </span><span>BioFusion</span><span> Pharmaceuticals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Josie saw Marcus, she was delighted, but unfortunately, she had to leave for a business trip to </span><span>Acoton</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was nearly time for her flight, so Marcus took her to the airport and saw her off. Then, he planned to swing by the Axe Gang, since he was already passing by Sync Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, Sync Group's entrance was bustling with activity. They were hosting a grand celebration for their 10th anniversary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stage was lit up with dazzling lights, and a high-energy performance was underway, drawing a crowd of curious onlookers.</span></p><div class="pagination">
