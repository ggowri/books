  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Xander was struck by a wave of primal terror, a fear that seemed to come from deep within his very soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Please, don't kill me... I've learned my lesson... Please, I beg you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Xander's body was drenched in rain, his face etched with despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he looked down at the bodies of the dead scattered across the ground, regret gnawed at his insides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If only he hadn't been so arrogant, if only he hadn't been blinded by his desire for revenge for his son, he wouldn't have ended up in this situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you hadn't sought revenge on me, none of this would have happened. Every action has its consequence. You brought this on yourself&mdash;don't blame anyone else!" Marcus spoke coldly, his words slicing through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a swift motion, Marcus grabbed Xander by the collar, lifting him off the ground with ease, holding him high above his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Xander's body trembled uncontrollably, like a leaf in the wind. He couldn't help himself; the words rushed out. "If you kill me, the Deleon family will hunt you down with everything they've got!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't even flinch. He simply let out a mocking laugh, cutting off Xander's threats. With a single, decisive twist, he snapped Xander's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man's lifeless body crumpled to the ground like a rag doll. Marcus then turned without a second glance at the body and walked toward Kiera.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera, still tied to the tree, had witnessed the carnage unfold before her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was in shock, almost numb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The scene felt surreal, like something out of a nightmare or a movie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To her, Marcus didn't seem like a man at all&mdash;he was like a god, wielding power beyond comprehension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The speed and precision with which he struck down his enemies left her breathless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you alright?" Marcus asked, his voice gentle, a stark contrast to the violence he had just unleashed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though rain was pouring down in sheets, an invisible shield seemed to surround Marcus, keeping him untouched by the downpour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera couldn't help but shiver, suddenly realizing that Marcus was no ordinary human being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm... I'm fine..." she replied, her voice trembling instinctively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus carefully untied her restraints and, without a word, threw her over his shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite the uncomfortable position, Kiera couldn't help but feel an overwhelming sense of safety, as though nothing could harm her while she was in his care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Marcus carried her out of the forest, he slid into his Aston Martin, disappearing into the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instead of returning to Bayside Villa, he drove straight to Solomia Hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera had been through a traumatic experience and needed to be checked into the hospital for observation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Marcus donned a pair of sunglasses and silently made his way to the male ICU ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Heath, his body still recovering from the surgery, had just awakened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The news that he had lost his ability to have children filled him with despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, when he heard that his father had sent powerful people to kill Marcus, a small part of him felt some comfort. Maybe, just maybe, Marcus would finally be put down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Heath was lying half-propped up in his hospital bed, staring blankly at the ceiling, waiting for the news of his father's success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The ICU door creaked open, and a man wearing sunglasses stepped inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Heath froze for a moment, his mind racing&mdash;something about the man's build seemed eerily familiar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who are you? How dare you enter the ICU without permission?" Heath demanded, his voice weak but filled with defiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before he could react further, the man reached into his coat, producing a syringe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without a word, he injected the contents of the syringe directly into Heath's IV.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Within moments, Heath's world went dark, and he lost consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a lethal dose, the same drug Marcus had used when he killed Pete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had chosen this particular drug because it would leave little trace and wouldn't cause a scene at the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By the time Heath's mother returned to the ICU, it was too late. She found her son lying cold in bed, his body already stiff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Believing he had merely fallen asleep, she hesitated to disturb him, but the next morning, a nurse found him, lifeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She fainted on the spot, and even though doctors revived her, the news she received shortly afterward&mdash;of her husband Xander's disappearance&mdash;sent her into a sudden cardiac arrest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She passed away before anyone could help her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just like that, the entire Heath family was wiped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus wasn't a cold-blooded killer, at least not by nature. He had never intended to take Heath's life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But after what Heath's father, Xander, had done&mdash;kidnapping Kiera and bringing in two Elders from the Astral Serpent Order to hunt him down&mdash;he had crossed a line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus had no choice but to ensure that Xander's family paid the ultimate price for their actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next day, news of the deaths of Xander and his family spread throughout Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It didn't take long for the Deleon family in Kingston to catch wind of the tragedy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jasper was furious when he heard the news. He immediately ordered his family to mobilize all their resources to track down the murderer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Xander was only a distant relative of the Deleon family, the audacity of someone murdering one of their own in such a small town like Solomia was an affront to the Deleon family's authority. It was a direct challenge to their power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as the command was issued, a young man in military uniform appeared in front of Jasper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Uncle, you must not investigate this matter any further!" The man's voice was firm and urgent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jasper's eyes narrowed, his confusion evident. "Oliver, what are you saying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver's face was grim as he spoke, his voice low but resolute. "This man... is someone you cannot afford to cross. If you provoke him, the Deleon family will fall, and we may not survive this. If we anger him, it could mean the end for all of us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At those words, Jasper froze, a chill running down his spine. The implications of what Oliver had said struck him like a thunderclap.</span></p><div class="pagination">
