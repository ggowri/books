        <h1>Chapter 471 Jade Wasn't Welcome</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade listened to Freya's explanation, immediately shaking her head in disagreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jayden, the reason we perform surgeries is to give patients a chance at a future where they can walk again&mdash;not just to preserve their legs. If we preserve their legs but they can't function, what's the point? My suggestion is that we focus on the possibility of restoring the patient's ability to walk," she stated firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At her words, both Jayden and Freya frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Freya smirked, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "Jade, I appreciate your idealistic thinking, but this patient's injuries are severe. Can you guarantee that he'll be walking after the surgery?" She paused for effect. "Stop talking big. If you can't make that promise, I suggest you keep quiet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade's teeth clenched in frustration. She couldn't stay silent. "Every surgery has a risk of failure. I can't guarantee the patient will walk, but as a doctor, it's my duty to try!" she retorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Freya's smirk deepened. "Well, since you can't guarantee the patient will walk, then you shouldn't even be involved. I'm the one leading this surgery. I don't want anyone else disrupting my focus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jayden, standing beside Freya, laughed coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The argument had drawn a small crowd of colleagues, who watched with a mix of amusement and judgment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In their eyes, Jade seemed oblivious to her situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jayden, the department head, had already made it clear that Jade wasn't welcome, and yet she still kept challenging him. It wasn't hard to see that this woman was digging her own grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, Jade had no real control over the surgery. Given the patient's critical state, it wasn't worth her getting involved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jade, if you think you can get the patient to walk again, and even restore his ability to run and jump, then I suppose you should be the one leading the surgery, right?" a voice suddenly interrupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone turned their gaze toward the source of the voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus walked through the crowd, his presence causing the group to fall silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His boldness and disregard for the situation immediately caught everyone's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some of the doctors exchanged looks, their expressions bewildered. Who was this guy, and why did he think he could speak up, especially when Jade herself couldn't?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade, too, recognized Marcus. Her surprise was evident as she processed the unexpected encounter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She hadn't anticipated running into him here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who are you? This is our department's business. What gives you the right to get involved?" Freya sneered at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm a friend of Jade's," Marcus replied confidently, "and I don't stand by and watch when I see people like you treating patients carelessly and causing division among colleagues. I'm stepping in because this is wrong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Having already familiarized himself with the details of the dispute, Marcus fully supported Jade's point of view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his past experiences, he had always seen Jade as a spoiled, unreasonable woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, after witnessing her defending the patient with such determination, his perception had shifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, he found himself standing up for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jade, when did you get such an arrogant friend?" Freya shot back, her tone icy. "Who does he think he is? Does he have any idea who he's talking to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade's face darkened. She pulled Marcus aside, her voice lowered in frustration. "What are you doing here? I know you mean well, but the patient's injuries are severe. I'm not even sure I can get him back on his feet, and you're talking about restoring his ability to run. That's impossible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus smiled, his tone reassuring. "Don't worry. I'll give you a specific surgical plan. If they agree to let you perform the surgery, just follow my instructions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade raised an eyebrow, still skeptical. "You better not mess this up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus smirked. "Do you really think I would? Don't you remember the surgery I recommended for your father, Robert, when he operated on Edward? You think I'd lead you astray?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade's eyes flickered with thought. "Alright, I'll do my best to push for it. From here on, it's up to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus nodded and the two of them returned to face Jayden and Freya.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade took a deep breath and, with determination in her voice, said, "I'll follow through with what Marcus suggested. I'll guarantee that this patient regains the ability to walk. If I fail, I'll resign as a doctor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this, Jayden and Freya exchanged smug glances, both of them unable to hide their satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had been waiting for Jade to make this commitment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the patient's injuries so severe, even the best doctors would struggle to get him back on his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If the surgery failed, Jade would have no choice but to leave the department, as they had always intended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Freya, her voice dripping with mockery, quickly chimed in, "Well, Jade, this is your promise. If the surgery fails, I hope you'll stick to your word."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade's expression remained firm, though inside, she knew the stakes were high. But she had made her choice, and she wouldn't back down now.</span></p></div>
