  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lila, I think Liz's words make sense. You're a star, and your boyfriend shouldn't be worse than Liz's."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacqueline nodded. Then, she looked at Marcus and said, "Marcus, Lila is not my biological daughter, but I raised her. I hope she will have a good future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can give her a good life, I will agree to you go on a date!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abraham, who had never spoken, said, "Don't compare anyone to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My status is really beyond the reach of ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't help it. My father was the vice general of Dragon Tiger Hall when I was born. You're humiliating me by comparing him to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Speaking, Abraham gave Marcus a sarcastic and disdainful look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacqueline suddenly felt a little embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abraham's words were a little harsh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't dare to stop him because of his identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of Liz's qualifications didn't match Abraham's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Abraham didn't respect Jacqueline, and she couldn't change it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liz said, "Mom, Abraham is right. Don't compare anyone to Abraham.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A man with no job and no money doesn't deserve to be compared to Abraham."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't understand why Lila, a top star, would date him. There are so many rich men pursuing her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Liz agreed with Abraham.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, Abraham was much better than Marcus, and the two of them should not be compared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liz became more and more bold in the way she spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words were an open mockery of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila frowned and said, "Liz, don't be so mean. After all, Marcus is my boyfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus is competent. You misunderstood him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In fact, Abraham is probably not as good as Marcus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liz and Abraham were shocked and showed a strange expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liz said sarcastically, "Are you kidding?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Abraham's father is the vice general of Dragon Tiger Hall. Do you remember?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, maybe you haven't heard of Dragon Tiger Hall?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's one of the most powerful gangs in the underground world of Kingston. Osborn has been the vice general of Dragon Tiger Hall for more than twenty years. He's now worth ten billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus can't be better than Abraham."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacqueline also reminded Lila, "Lila, we understand. Don't worry. Abraham will introduce you to a high-level figure in the Dragon Tiger Hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus said that he has no job and his parents are farmers. He can't be better than Abraham."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abraham sneered, looked at Liz, and said, "Why doesn't Lila want to acknowledge the excellence of others?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've warned her, but she's stubborn. I regret coming here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't invite me to a dinner like this next time. I don't want to see her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liz was afraid that Abraham would be angry and said hurriedly, "Abraham, don't be angry. Such a thing will never happen again. Can you set Lila up with a boyfriend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abraham said, "Although Lila is hypocritical, she is a popular star. The leader of the Team Tiger, Darren Crane, is planning to marry recently. If she agrees, I will ask Darren."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liz said hurriedly, "Lila is only 23 years old this year. Darren is an older man, right? It's inapposite."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abraham glanced at Lila with disdain and said, "So what? To put it bluntly, Lila is just an incompetent and unpopular internet celebrity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Darren has many businesses under his control and has eight billion dollars. It will be a blessing for her to marry him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liz nodded, turned to Lila, and said, "Lila, I think it's a good thing for you. Although Darren is a little older, he is a powerful figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And he is rich and so much better than Marcus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila looked unhappy and was about to speak. But Marcus spoke.</span></p><div class="pagination">
