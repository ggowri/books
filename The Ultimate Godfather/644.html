        <h1>Chapter 643 An Old Friend</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was driving his Aston Martin, cruising back toward Bayside Villa, when he suddenly found himself stuck in a massive traffic jam on a bustling street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cars were barely inching forward, and what should've been a short stretch took him a full five minutes just to get through one intersection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he approached, he realized the holdup was due to an accident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Up ahead, a Porsche was parked in the middle of the road with its hazard lights flashing. Not far from it, an electric delivery bike had been knocked over, its parts scattered all over the pavement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A woman in a skimpy skirt was yelling at a delivery man in the middle of the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you have any idea how much my car cost? I just bought this Porsche a month ago! And look what you've done to it! This is going to cost a fortune to fix! You couldn't even pay me back if you sold your life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pay up, NOW! At least 200 thousand dollars, or I'm calling the cops on you. You're not going anywhere!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The delivery man, who looked to be in his twenties but seemed much older due to years of hard work under the sun, looked genuinely sorry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His weathered eyes, once deep and youthful, now carried a weariness that betrayed his struggles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ma'am, I was just riding straight in the bike lane," he explained. "You turned right without checking your mirrors, and I couldn't stop in time. It wasn't my fault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your car's expensive, but that doesn't mean I was the one who broke the rules. Let's wait for the cops to get here and figure out who's really at fault."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, the woman slapped him hard across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The slap was so powerful that it knocked his helmet off and left five red streaks across his cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You hit my car, and now you want to wait for the cops? You're a poor loser! If you can't pay for the repairs, fine, then kneel and lick the soles of my shoes clean, and maybe I'll let you off. Otherwise, start coughing up the money!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that the woman didn't care about the facts. She just wanted her money, and she wasn't shy about using violence to get it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A small crowd had gathered by now, including some drivers who'd been passing by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of them had dash cams, which had captured the entire accident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The footage clearly showed that the delivery man had been riding in the bike lane when the woman's Porsche made an illegal right turn, causing the collision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to traffic laws, the delivery man was in the clear, and the woman should be held responsible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the woman wasn't interested in the truth. She demanded compensation and wasn't shy about threatening the delivery man with her power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The drivers standing around, witnessing this injustice, shook their heads in disgust, but none of them dared to step in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, this woman was </span><span>with</span><span> a powerful project manager at Bayside Petroleum Company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>H</span><span>i</span><span>s wealth and connections had made her arrogant and untouchable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't her first run-in with trouble either. A while back, she had gotten into a violent confrontation with another parent while dropping her child off at school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd blinded the other parent in one eye, and although the police had gotten involved, her </span><span>husband</span><span> had used his influence to bury the incident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other parent had received some compensation, but the woman had faced no consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, she was even bolder, tossing her power around without a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she raised her shoe and looked at the delivery man with disdain. "Can't pay? Fine, lick my shoes clean right now. Keep dragging this out, and I'll make sure you never work in Solomia again. Do you want that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The delivery man had heard of her before. He came from a poor background, and his life as a delivery driver wasn't easy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't afford to pay the figure she demanded. If he angered her, it could be the end of his career.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold sweat broke out on him as he seriously considered lowering himself to her demand, kneeling to lick her shoes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Marcus, who had been watching the whole scene unfold, froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he got a closer look at the delivery man's face, a name popped into his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chad Maximus had been one of Marcus' few good friends back in high school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had been close back then, and Marcus remembered that Chad's family had been well-off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, just a few years later, Chad had fallen so far.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was now struggling to make ends meet delivering food, looking far older than the carefree student Marcus remembered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chad seemed to hear his name. He turned around instinctively and saw Marcus walking toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus... Is that really you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chad's face lit up with recognition and excitement, and he eagerly stepped forward to hold Marcus' hand.</span></p></div>
