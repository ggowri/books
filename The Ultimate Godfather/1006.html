  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the mention of it, both Yasser and Brett exchanged a sharp look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brett raised an eyebrow and said, "Devon, you really think a guy in his early twenties could be that strong?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if someone started training since birth, he'd still be nothing special. You're being too careful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Devon could say anything, Yasser chimed in, "Yeah, Devon, my dad's right. I remember when I was in my twenties, I was barely at Ancient Martial Stage Four. Even if someone had more talent than me, getting to Stage Six would have been a huge deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm guessing this guy must have some kind of background to be bold enough to go after my woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But honestly, in Uswad, we don't have anything to fear. If the people behind him try to get involved, I'll just call in the three Grandmasters of our family and wipe him off the map."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser said it with absolute confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Tucker family wasn't just any Ancient Martial Art family. They were one of the oldest and most respected in Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their influence in Kinton Mountains wasn't just because the younger generation was talented, but also because of their three Grandmasters, each at Acquired State Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was as top-tier as you could get in Uswad's Ancient Martial Art world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Marcus had some sort of background, Yasser wasn't worried. He knew the strength of the Tucker family, and it was more than enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yasser is right. If it comes down to it, we'll have the Grandmasters back us up. With them, the Tucker family could run the whole world of Ancient Martial Art in Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Devon, you don't really think that kid can stand up to our three Grandmasters, do you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Devon nodded slowly, but there was still a knot of unease in his stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some reason, he couldn't shake the feeling that Marcus wasn't as simple as he seemed. There was something about him that felt dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But thinking about the three Tucker family Grandmasters, Devon sighed and tried to calm his nerves. Maybe he was just overthinking things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that settled, Yasser made plans to head to Solomia the next day to deal with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he left, though, he paid a visit to the dungeon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood over Gertie, who was chained to a stone pillar, her body covered in bruises and cuts. A wicked grin spread across Yasser's face. "How's the torture? Feeling good?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie was barely conscious, her body wrecked, but she still managed to lift her head and glare at him. "Yasser, what are you here for? To watch me suffer? If my cousin finds out what you're doing, she'll make sure you pay for this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser chuckled darkly, his smile cold, "Your cousin? You mean Ada?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're a warrior. Don't you know where the Celestial Arc Orde stands compared to my family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It might be one of the top three martial arts factions in Uswad, but compared to us, they're nothing. Barely even worth mentioning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your cousin isn't even close to my level. If she shows up, I'll make sure the Celestial Arc Order disappears from Uswad's Ancient Martial Art world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm here to let you know, tomorrow I'm going to Solomia. I'm bringing your lover back to the Tucker family, and I'll make sure he dies in the most painful way. And after that? You two will meet again in hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser's laughter was full of arrogant satisfaction, as if Marcus was already his prisoner, just waiting for him to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie's eyes flashed with surprise. She hadn't expected Yasser to be so eager to go after Marcus.</span></p><div class="pagination">
