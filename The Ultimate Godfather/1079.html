        <h1>Chapter 972 Garrick Of Faust Properties-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone stepped forward, lowering their voice. "Dude, you have no idea who you just messed with. That's Sebastien. If you lay a hand on him, his dad, Garrick, won't let you off easy.</span><br><span>"And after what you did&mdash;making sure their family line ends with him&mdash;there's no way this ends well for you. If I were you, I'd leave town before things get ugly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, man, sometimes you gotta know when to back down. Guys like us? We're nobodies. We can't go up against a powerhouse like the Faust family. Hell, even if Garrick comes after you, the cops won't do a damn thing.</span><br><span>"His brother, Regis, is the chief of police around here. The whole system is rigged in their favor," another person chimed in, clearly trying to warn Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus simply waved them off. "Relax. Neither Garrick nor Regis can touch me. If they even try, I'll make sure Faust Properties is wiped off the map in Solomia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment those words left his mouth, the entire room fell silent. No one had expected a guy who looked so unremarkable to say something so audacious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wipe out Faust Properties in Solomia? That sounded like pure delusion. Even though many people secretly approved of Marcus standing up to Sebastien, none of them actually believed he had the power to back up such a claim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morgana, in particular, gave him a long, searching look. She knew that Nicole's family came from a remote rural area under Solomia's jurisdiction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Nicole had never mentioned living in a villa, her official records painted her as nothing more than a countryside girl from some backwater village. A place so isolated and impoverished that it was barely on the map.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So in Morgana's eyes, there was no way Nicole's family was anything special.</span><br><span>Marcus is her brother, how much better can his background be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more she thought about it, the more convinced she became that Marcus was just bluffing.</span><br><span>She sighed and urged him, "Now's not the time to act tough. Get out of here while you still can&mdash;take Nicole and leave Solomia. If you don't, you're going to regret it. Listen to me and go. Now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morgana had a strict, no-nonsense way of handling things, and she had a tendency to push her morals onto others. But one thing was undeniable&mdash;her principles were solid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially earlier, when Nicole was in danger. Morgana had stepped in without hesitation, using her authority as a class advisor to protect her students.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That alone had earned Marcus a bit of respect for her. And now, seeing her trying to persuade him to run, his opinion of her rose even further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he shook his head. "I'm not going anywhere. If I leave, what about you? You were involved in this too. Do you really think Faust Properties will let you off the hook? No&mdash;when you go after the snake, you have to crush the head. Just sit back and watch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Marcus pulled up a chair and lazily sat down, as if he had all the time in the world. He was waiting for Garrick to arrive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastien smirked, amusement flickering across his face. "Damn, I gotta admit&mdash;you've got guts. You're actually sitting here, waiting to die."</span><br><span>His expression turned sinister. "Fine. Stay put. The moment my dad gets here, I'm making sure you never walk again. Hell, I'll have him chop off your limbs and toss you into the ocean for the sharks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Sebastien pulled out his phone and dialed Garrick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The call connected, and a gruff voice came through the line. "What's up? Something wrong?"</span></p></div>
