  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sat lost in thought, wrestling with more profound questions that weighed on her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reality of being Marcus' woman slowly sank in, and she gradually came to terms with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden ring broke the silence of Maxine's phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly picked up the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man's voice came from the other end. "Officer Burnett, where did you run off to? Weren't we supposed to meet up before seeing the Special Advisor? Why aren't you at the Police Academy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine kept her voice level as she replied, "I'm meeting with a friend, and we agreed on 1.00 PM. It's only 11.30 now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's voice turned cold. "That's beside the point. The fact that you're meeting </span><span>someone else before Special Advisor shows a serious lack of judgment. Do you know how hard I worked to get you this meeting? You don't appreciate the opportunity I've created for you. I'm honestly disappointed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's face darkened at his words. "Look, I appreciate you setting up this meeting with Special Advisor, I do. But I can always cancel if it's such a hassle for you. The last thing I want is to be a burden to anyone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man sighed heavily, "Just send me your location. I'll come pick you up, and we'll see the Special Advisor together. Yeah, the meeting's at 1 PM, but showing up early will demonstrate our commitment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing this, Maxine opened WhatsApp and shared her location with the contact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up the phone, Marcus asked Maxine, "Did you need something?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine took a deep breath before responding, "I'm planning to meet with the Special Advisor later today with someone else. Would you like to join us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow slightly and inquired, "Which Special Advisor are we talking about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was already suspicious about the answer but wanted to confirm his guess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know, the one who saved Commander Ashford on </span><span>Solomia</span><span> Street a few days ago. That guy was something else. He single-handedly took down dozens of thugs; every shot he fired was a kill shot. Talk about deadly accuracy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Commander Ashford was so impressed that he pulled some strings to keep him around. He appointed him </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> Special Advisor, giving him the same privileges as a regional commander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wilde asked me to visit the Special Advisor, but I didn't have any direct connections, so I had to ask a friend in the military to introduce us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' expression turned peculiar as he listened to Maxine's explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had indeed received a WhatsApp message from Lydia that morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had informed him that a senior staff officer from the </span><span>Rowane</span><span> Military District would be coming to visit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lydia had asked if Marcus wanted to meet them, saying she would decline if he weren't interested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had asked Lydia about the timing, and she told him it would be around 1 PM.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She assured him it wouldn't take much of his time, fifteen minutes at most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The senior staff officer was reportedly the son of the </span><span>Rowane</span><span> District Commander and the first person to receive the Individual Hero Award at the International Military Academy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had casually agreed to the meeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, since </span><span>Solomia</span><span> fell under </span><span>Rowane</span><span> Military District's jurisdiction, he couldn't afford to brush off the District Commander thoroughly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never expected that they would bring Maxine along to meet him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen to what I'm saying. This Special Advisor position carries the same authority as a Military Region Commander. The power that comes with it is no joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I managed to snag this opportunity thanks to Cody Durant, the son of </span><span>Rowane's</span><span> military region commander. If you want to meet him too, I can ask Cody. Bringing </span><span>you along shouldn't be a problem."</span></p><div class="pagination">
