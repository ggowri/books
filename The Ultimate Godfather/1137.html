        <h1>Chapter 1002 The New Path of Conquest-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I hope you remember what I said before."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, Ryan handed the ring he was wearing to Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The ring was intricately carved with dragons and phoenixes, adorned with a dazzling and brilliant sapphire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ryan used his last bit of strength to place the ring onto Marcus's hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He instructed, "This ring represents the identity of the Godfather. From now on, you are the Godfather. Everything in this world is under your control."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But I hope you remember one thing. Your two brothers will surely resent you, maybe even try to kill you. I hope you can spare their lives. As long as they live, I can rest in peace!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After that, Ryan took his last breath and passed away completely!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Until the very last moment, he still thought of Bruce and Roger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Father, I promise you, I will fulfill your last wish, return to Atrandis Continent, and reclaim everything that belongs to you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Additionally, I will also follow your wish and spare their lives," Marcus promised, looking at Ryan's body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were tears in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was Ryan's third son. Logically, with Bruce and Roger's abilities, they also had the qualifications to inherit the Godfather position.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Ryan entrusted this heavy responsibility to Marcus, which was a complete act of trust in him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Ryan's trust and their family bond, Marcus should strive to fulfill his last wish.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's been so long. Why hasn't he come out yet? How's our father?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, a cold voice came from the entrance of the mansion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The speaker was naturally Roger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus had been inside the mansion for almost an hour, but he still hadn't come out. Roger was very dissatisfied with this and wanted to barge in by force.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Marcus stepped out directly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Roger saw him, his gaze was icy. He asked Marcus bitterly, "What did our father say to you? Why did it take you so long to come out?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, he immediately noticed the sapphire ring on Marcus's finger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Roger's eyes widened in shock. "The ring! Has our father already passed away?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words caught the attention of Bruce and the other experts under Ryan, and they all stepped over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus nodded and replied, "Godfather has passed away and bestowed the position of Godfather upon me. You must submit to me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bruce and Roger's faces instantly turned extremely grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Roger growled, "I don't believe it. I don't believe our father would pass the position of Godfather to you. In every aspect, you're no match for me. You're not worthy of being Godfather!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Bruce said nothing, his expression clearly showed that he strongly agreed with Roger's words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Roger's words, Marcus sneered, "What, do you intend to go against our father's will?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Roger's face turned ashen. He said, "You claim our father passed the position of Godfather to you. Who witnessed it? I suspect you're seizing power through treachery."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He glanced at everyone and shouted, "Ladies and gentlemen, you all fought alongside my father. Tell me, does what I say make sense?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Beside Ryan stood many of Roger's confidants.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were followers he had cultivated over the years.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing his words, they all expressed their support and began targeting Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You see, everyone thinks this way. If you can't provide evidence, then you're seizing power through treachery. I have the authority to execute you on behalf of our father!" Roger sneered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus gave him a strange look and said, "If you want to fight me, just do it. No need for all this roundabout talk. My position as Godfather was personally passed down by our father. I don't need to prove anything to anyone!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many present looked at Marcus, feeling somewhat surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had heard before that Ryan found his third son, an ordinary man from Uswad.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though he has now embarked on the path of cultivation, they still don't think he is a match for Roger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Marcus actually showed no fear of Roger's threats and directly challenged him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was too bold. At the same time, most people thought he was courting death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, you can't!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana immediately stepped forward to stop Marcus. She knew Roger's strength best.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She still thought Marcus's cultivation was only at Acquired State Nine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In her view, with his State, it was very difficult for him to defeat Roger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry. He can't hurt me!" Marcus sneered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could tell that Roger's cultivation was at Innate State Four.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Marcus's cultivation was only at Innate State One, he had mastered Hidden State.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With some of his advanced techniques, he was confident he could defeat Roger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You really think with your strength, you're qualified to challenge me? In that case, let me show you the gap between us!" Roger sneered, his gaze at Marcus full of mockery.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, everyone saw Roger's aura burst forth, with a terrifying destructive force swirling around him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His cultivation was Innate State Four. His aura erupted completely, and in an instant, the entire space became incredibly oppressive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He threw a punch, the Fist Ray containing astonishing destructive force. In the blink of an eye, it was right in front of Marcus!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This punch of mine only used seventy percent of my strength. I&rsquo;d like to see how you&rsquo;ll withstand it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus, however, showed no fear and threw a punch.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His punch contained Timeless Numinous Energy, Thunderfire Power, and Rune Current, instantly elevating the power of the Fist Ray to an entirely new level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next moment, everyone heard a terrifying rumble echoing as an incredibly dreadful destructive force spread in all directions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Roger revealed a confident smile, believing that this strike was enough to kill Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he never expected that Marcus's strike was many times more powerful than he had imagined.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The destructive force surged forward, instantly shattering Roger's attack into pieces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, the power of Marcus's punch remained undiminished. In an instant, it landed right in front of Roger's body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Roger desperately unleashed his energy to resist, but his efforts were completely futile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus's punch was simply too powerful, instantly forcing a muffled groan from Roger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Roger staggered backward repeatedly. A surge of blood churned from his chest to his throat, and he almost spat it out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone present was surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one expected Marcus to be this strong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How is this possible? How could this be? Your cultivation has actually reached the Innate State. How did you do it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Roger looked at Marcus in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Roger seemed to realize something and continued, "I get it, you must have inherited our father's power. Otherwise, your cultivation couldn't have advanced this quickly!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why? Why is this happening? Why would our father favor you so much?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Upon realizing the answer, Roger suddenly couldn't accept it and fell into a frenzied state.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Enough talk. I am now the Godfather. If you don't submit to me, I will suppress you next!"</span></p></div>
