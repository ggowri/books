        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blonde bombshell spoke, her ice-blue eyes flashing dangerously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take it easy. Even if he's making some noise now, he can't escape my grasp!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger spoke up, seemingly reluctant to let the blonde beauty take action herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She furrowed her perfect brows, determination settling across her stunning features. "No, I must eliminate him myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she turned and strode out of the command center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger watched her leave without trying to stop her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus remained oblivious to all of this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just one night, he had perfectly mastered one of the Rune from the Heavenly Circle Diagram.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time flew by until 7:30 AM when Lila finally stirred from her slumber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though she'd slept deeply and peacefully, barely dreaming at all,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila still felt like she'd been put through the wringer, with every joint in her body aching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shot Marcus a glare and said, "Mr. Fitzgerald, this is all your fault! You were so rough with me yesterday. Now everything hurts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled, "I admit I was pretty intense, but judging by your reaction, it seemed like you wanted me to go even harder."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the power of the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire behind him, no woman could resist the overwhelming waves of pleasure it brought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even someone as reserved as Lila, who usually held onto her composure, couldn't withstand that euphoria. She had given in completely, demanding more without restraint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was also the main reason why every joint in Lila's body ached now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Marcus' words, a blush immediately crept across Lila's delicate face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at the clock&mdash;it was already 7:40 AM.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The performance was scheduled for 11:00 AM, so she began getting up to wash and do her makeup. "Mr. Fitzgerald, turn around! You're not allowed to look at me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the long night they'd spent together, Lila still seemed shy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smirked and teased, "I've already seen every inch of you except your insides. What's the harm in looking a little longer?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fuming, Lila bit her lip in frustration. "No! Turn around right now! I can't handle it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her adamant insistence, Marcus sighed and reluctantly turned his back to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila stood up and wrapped herself in a bath towel, then quickly made her way to the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of running water filled the air, steam rising into the space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From Marcus' position, he could make out Lila's silhouette through the mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had always been drawn to beauty since he was young.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remembered watching period dramas as a child, always captivated by the elegant </span><span>actresses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that he had found someone special, his appreciation only grew deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Lila emerged, she was wearing a new set of light-colored clothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her smooth complexion made Marcus' heart skip a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Marcus' phone buzzed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a message from Josie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' brow furrowed as he opened it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The message contained an image and some text.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the photo, Josie was bound with rope and gagged with tape, forced to kneel on the ground. Two men stood beside her, pointing heavy weapons at her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even from just a photo, Marcus could see the terror in Josie's expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[If you want your woman to live, come to the Black Hawk Legion headquarters in </span><span>Acoton</span><span> within three days. If not, you'll face the consequences!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes turned icy as he read the text message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd just put Josie on a flight to </span><span>Acoton</span><span> a few days ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never expected the Black Hawk Legion would kidnap her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus hadn't wanted to get involved with the Black Hawk Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now they'd dared to touch his one vulnerability. If that were how they wanted to play it, he'd make sure this organization disappeared from the face of the earth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to take care of something. I'll be back in about two days," Marcus told Lila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus' grave expression, Lila sensed something was off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she was tactful enough not to pry, merely giving Marcus a slight nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus left the room and quickly pulled up the coordinate map in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately located the headquarters of the Black Hawk Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus dragged the coordinates to a desolate mountain about 6 miles away from the Black Hawk Legion headquarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using teleport, he teleported to that mountainous location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking about an hour to restore his depleted Numinous Energy to its peak state, Marcus then headed straight for the Black Hawk Legion headquarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a world-renowned mercenary organization, the Black Hawk Legion wielded immense power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their headquarters was nothing short of a military base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was heavily guarded by countless fully armed personnel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beyond mercenaries recruited from every corner of the globe, the Black Hawk Legion possessed an arsenal of heavy equipment and cyborgs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They even had everything from aircraft to artillery to tanks and all the weapons typically reserved for full-scale warfare!</span></p></div>
