  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The attention of all the people present was attracted by the groan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A middle-aged woman lay in the aisle of the carriage, convulsing, pale, and moaning in pain, apparently suffering from some sudden illness!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My mother has appendicitis and is going to Solariae for surgery. She's probably having an acute attack of appendicitis. If the appendicitis perforates, she could be in danger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everybody, please call a doctor, or she will be in danger!" A teenager said anxiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mom, how are you? We'll be in Solariae soon. Hang in there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The teenager leaned forward and helped his mother back to her seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The middle-aged woman's forehead was covered with cold sweat, and she had already collapsed. She said, "It hurts. When's the doctor coming? I can't stand it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She sounded distressed and out of breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although appendicitis was a small disease, in the acute attack period, if the patient did not get timely treatment, resulting in perforation, she would have a life-threatening!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even with the advanced medical treatment of Uswad, many people died every year because of appendicitis perforation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The doctor on board has asked for leave. What should we do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two policemen glanced at each other with anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It happened that the doctor on board asked for leave today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Normally, a train should have several doctors on board.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this was a short-distance train, so the medical security was not as strict as the management of long-distance trains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without the doctor on board, the middle-aged woman was in danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I am a doctor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, however, Jade, who had just insisted that Marcus was a peeping tom, spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She picked up a bag and walked quickly to the middle-aged woman. The bag was full of stethoscopes, thermometers, blood pressure meters, and other medical equipment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She began by giving the middle-aged woman a painkiller prescribed by the medical system.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Jade quickly checked for the middle-aged woman. Jade's face was sullen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The patient looks pale. Her heart is beating fast, the pain is unbearable, and her blood pressure is high. I suspect that the appendix has been perforated. If she is not operated in time, her life will be in danger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade looked up and said to the boy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The middle-aged woman's son panicked and prayed to Jade sadly, "Doctor, please save my mother. I can't lose her. Please, doctor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade shook her head and sighed, "There are no surgical conditions on the train. Unless the train stops right now and gets your mother to the hospital right away, she can be saved!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, the boy immediately prayed to the police.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The policeman shook his head and said, "We want to stop to save her, but there are not enough tracks on this line. And there are other trains running on the line. An accident is likely if the train stops prematurely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And we're in an area where Solomia and Solariae meet. Even if we stop and get to the nearby township hospital, it will take forty minutes. It may be too late."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The middle-aged woman's son looked at Jade again with expectation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade shook her head helplessly. "It will be too late. Now, all we can do is pray your mother holds on long enough to get to the hospital. Of course, during this time, I will try my best to use some medical means to slow down the process of appendix perforation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The teenager began to cry. It never occurred to him that his mother might die of appendicitis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Baby, it's okay. No matter what happens, you have to be strong. It is God's will, and no one can change it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The middle-aged woman tried to comfort her son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus got up from his seat and came to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade gave Marcus a wary look and asked, "What do you want? The patient needs rest. Don't fool around! "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus said, "Appendicitis perforation is very dangerous. Your method can really relieve the patient's pain, but once the perforation gets worse, the patient's chances of survival will be lower. Let me try."</span></p><div class="pagination">
