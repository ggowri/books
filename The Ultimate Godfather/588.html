We could easily bring even greater trouble to the Celestial Arc Order!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Ivan finished speaking, everyone present was momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shock appeared on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Phoenix's death caused a massive stir in the world of Ancient Martial Arts in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was secretly speculating about who had killed Phoenix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Ivan seemed to have proffered an answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nevertheless, while they were slightly taken aback, they rejected Ivan's words in their hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all knew that Phoenix's power had reached the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Phoenix had lingered at this level for numerous years, his power far outstripping that of his peers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could a young man vanquish such a formidable figure? It was a notion they found exceedingly difficult to accept.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elder Raimi, has your information been confirmed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An expert from the Celestial Arc Order asked Ivan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ivan shook his head and said, "It hasn't been confirmed. All of this is just my inference after the investigation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, everyone breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The expert who had asked the question even sneered, "Since what you said hasn't been confirmed, everything is just your speculation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That guy killed an elder of our Celestial Arc Order. He is simply unpardonable. If we don't respond at all, won't we be laughed at?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How will we hold our ground in the world of Ancient Martial Arts in </span><span>Uswad</span><span> in the future?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other elders of the Celestial Arc Order immediately agreed with the words of this expert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all shouted one after another that they wanted to kill the murderer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ivan seemed intent on dissuading them, but Millet said, "Save your breath. From the moment that guy killed an elder of our Celestial Arc Order, he has already been on my death list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Immediately order everyone to search for his whereabouts with all </span><span>your</span><span> might. Once the location is determined, you must kill him at all costs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Millet finished speaking, someone hastened to carry out the order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ivan wore an abashed expression, uncertain whether Millet's decision would prove fortuitous or calamitous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when Millet issued this decree, for some inexplicable reason, a profound sense of unease welled up within Ivan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't know what had happened in the Celestial Arc Order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this juncture, he was on his way back to Bayside Villa in a vehicle from the Golden Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus briefly learned about the recent business situation of the Golden Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Michelle's stewardship, all was proceeding swimmingly for the Golden Group. Its business volume had soared, and it had essentially cemented its position as the </span><span>preeminent company in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furthermore, the turnover of the newly erected pharmaceutical industrial park of the Golden Group had already rivaled that of top-tier companies in first-tier cities like </span><span>Solariae</span><span> and Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, dusk was fast approaching. The sun was setting in the west, and a crimson glow suffused the horizon where the sea and sky converged, painting a scene of ethereal beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Marcus suddenly sensed a suffocating coercion plummeting from the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The coercion encapsulated a specific space, and in an instant, everything within this space seemed to grind to a halt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Aston Martin, which had been hurtling along Bayside Avenue, came to a complete stop under the coercion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Marcus look furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but get out of the car and look in a certain direction in the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A gorgeous woman wearing a tight and black leather skirt appeared there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman boasted golden hair and azure eyes. Her countenance was angelic, and her figure was sinfully alluring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes sparkled like sapphires, such that Marcus felt he could lose himself in their depths with a single glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you here to see me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus called out to the woman in the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman glanced at Marcus from head to toe and said, "You are worthy of being Godfather's third son. You bear the blood of the natives in Oriana Land, yet you remain gentle and dashing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm rather astonished that you can still move about freely under my coercion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You haven't answered my question yet," Marcus retorted. Although the woman had yet to make a move, Marcus was acutely aware that her power dwarfed his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had even attained a state that lay beyond his reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Timeless Warrior's Grimoire recorded that there </span><span>were</span><span> a total of nine stages in the cultivation of Ancient Martial Arts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These nine stages constituted the traditional cultivation framework.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, on the final page of the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, the nine stages of Ancient Martial Arts cultivation were regarded as the Foundation Establishment Stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This implied that there were higher levels beyond the Foundation Establishment Stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was said that in some mysterious areas around the world, there were some ancient experts whose power far exceeded that of those in the Foundation Establishment Stage.</span></p><div class="pagination">
