        <h1>Chapter 952 You Really Messed Up</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene left Everett, Chloe, and the rest of Serpent's Coil grunts dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could've dreamed Callum would turn on Stanley like that&mdash;and from the fury in his eyes, it looked like he wanted to beat the guy to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of grudge could spark that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just minutes ago, they'd been tight&mdash;Callum ready to throw down for Stanley's payback. Now he was pummeling him? What the hell was going on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe's mind raced to a wild guess, but she brushed it off&mdash;too crazy, too naive to believe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley's pleas only seemed to piss Callum off more. His fists came down harder, teeth gritted as he snarled, "You dug your own grave, punk, and you've got the nerve to beg me for help? I'm doing you a favor not snapping your neck right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley, wincing through the pain, looked lost and pitiful. "Callum, give me a straight answer&mdash;what did I do to make you hate me this much? If I'm gonna die, at least let me get it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Open your damn eyes, you idiot," Callum spat, his glare ice-cold. "You could've crossed anyone, but you picked Mr. Fitzgerald? Who else am I supposed to waste?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sweat beaded on his forehead as he could already see the mess he was in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald... Callum... you mean the Mr. Fitzgerald? The one running Serpent's Coil?" Stanley's brain finally clicked, cold sweat pouring down his face, his whole body shaking like a leaf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett and Chloe stared, slack-jawed. Marcus, this guy they'd known, had that kind of clout?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe especially couldn't wrap her head around it. Marcus had dropped hints about who he was more than once, but she'd never bought it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serpent's Coil was the undisputed king of Solomia's underworld&mdash;too big, too powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The idea that Marcus wasn't just the Death whispered about in Uswad's business circles, but also Serpent's Coil's top dog?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was mind-blowing, and she'd need a minute to shake off the shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Guess you're not as dumb as you look," Callum growled, yanking Stanley up by the collar like a ragdoll. "Mr. Fitzgerald's the guy even Edgar and Jalen bow to, and you had the balls to step on his toes? Tell me&mdash;what's your punishment supposed to be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dragged Stanley over and shoved him down in front of Marcus. "Kneel, you piece of trash. Apologize to Mr. Fitzgerald&mdash;or I'll end you right here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley didn't dare fight back. His knees buckled, and he hit the ground hard, staring up at Marcus with none of the old swagger&mdash;just raw fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he'd known Marcus ran Serpent's Coil, he wouldn't have touched him with a ten-foot pole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was all Everett's fault&mdash;dragging him into this mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But regrets wouldn't save him now. All he could do was pray Marcus wouldn't go too hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thud. Callum dropped to his knees too, his face a mask of desperate respect. "Mr. Fitzgerald, this is on me&mdash;I screwed up. I let this moron cross you. I deserve whatever's coming."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He started slapping himself, each hit ringing out loud and sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, half his face was swollen red, blood trickling from his nose and mouth&mdash;a pitiful sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved him off, signaling him to stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Callum froze, confused. "Mr. Fitzgerald, you got anything else for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus eyed him coolly. "Him mouthing off to me? That's small potatoes. You still don't get where you really messed up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Callum flinched, realization hitting him like a brick. His voice shook as he stammered, "I... I shouldn't have dealt drugs. Shouldn't have let my crew use it. I broke Serpent's Coil's code."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded, satisfied. "So tell me&mdash;did someone green-light this, or was it all you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't messing around. If Serpent's Coil's chain of command was rotting, he needed to know how deep it went.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Callum's sweat-soaked face trembled. "Mr. Fitzgerald, it was me&mdash;I got greedy, thought I could skim some cash on the side with the drug gig. No one else signed off on it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You sure about that?" Marcus' stare turned frigid, a heavy vibe rolling off him&mdash;pure, unshakeable authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dead sure, sir. I wouldn't lie to you&mdash;it was my call, no one else's," Callum insisted, voice cracking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, in a flash, he snatched a dagger from one of his guys and&mdash;slash&mdash;hacked off his own left hand right there in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood sprayed, a dull sound echoing as the blade bit through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He screamed, face going pale, but forced himself to stay upright, bowing to Marcus. "Mr. Fitzgerald, I messed up&mdash;I know it. I own it. Please give me a pass this once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll torch every last stash I've got back at Serpent's Coil. If I ever touch drugs again, I'll cut myself down to make it right."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He started slamming his forehead into the pavement, kowtowing hard, eyes pleading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley and Everett watched, guts twisting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley's hands shook&mdash;Callum had just chopped off his own arm, and he'd pissed Marcus off way worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fate could be uglier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right then, Callum's glare flicked his way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley jolted, terror flashing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He scrambled to his feet, trying to bolt&mdash;but two of Callum's crew grabbed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One slammed a boot into his knee, dropping him back down in front of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You crossed Mr. Fitzgerald and think you can just run?" Callum snarled. "Chop his limbs off&mdash;toss him in the bay to sink!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was livid. If it weren't for Stanley, he wouldn't be in this hole, hacking off his own hand. He wanted him in pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The goons jumped to it, pinning Stanley down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He screamed, thrashing like a trapped animal, but it was no use.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A blade flashed&mdash;shrunk&mdash;and his left hand was gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pain hit him like a truck, nearly knocking him out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then the right hand, both legs&mdash;blood pooling everywhere, the air thick with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley's screams faded to a numb whimper, his face a ghostly white.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the crew grabbed a sack, shoved Stanley's hacked-up body inside, and tied it shut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wailed again, realizing what was next, but they didn't care. They hauled him to a van parked outside and peeled off.</span></p></div>
