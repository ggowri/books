        <h1>Chapter 409 Heavenly Punishment Blood Curse</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, the Curse Weavers who had been gnawing on human limbs froze mid-bite, their red eyes narrowing as they fixed their gaze on Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They watched him like predators eyeing their next meal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of the Curse Weavers licked his lips, a wicked grin spreading across his face. "This Uswadian's energy is brimming with power. A taste of him would definitely give us a major boost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The others chuckled darkly, their eyes flashing with hunger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, you're right. This kid's got a pure, sun-like body. His flesh alone would be a feast, and with his cultivation techniques, if we split him up... we'll definitely level up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stay here. I'll take care of him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The High Pries' eyes glinted with greedy desire as he looked at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, he let out a powerful, dark aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Curse Weavers were akin to wizards or warriors, their power defined by mastery over dark magic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The High Priest, Eden Child, however, was a Peak Fifth-stage Curse Weaver&mdash;his power was at least half a tier above Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, a surge of curses erupted from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A blood-red light flickered in front of him, and with a snap of his fingers, a massive, glowing handprint shot straight toward Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The handprint carried an overwhelming wave of malicious energy, as if it were a deadly totem coming to life right before Marcus' eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Blood Curse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' mind raced as he immediately understood what the High Priest was doing. He was trying to plant a blood curse inside him! This was pure evil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without hesitation, Marcus activated Shadow Step, narrowly dodging the deadly strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The curse split into three, and one of the smaller fragments slammed into Marcus' body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He instantly felt a rush of corrupting energy spreading inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The blood curse dug deeper into his body, making his whole being tremble, as though it was draining his very life force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The curse started feeding on his blood and energy, and within an instant, Marcus felt himself losing consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You've been cursed by our High Priest! You're done for! Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of the Curse Weavers laughed manically, gloating over his victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Snap!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But before he could finish, Marcus' scimitar flashed, and he slashed the Curse Weaver's throat in one clean stroke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Curse Weaver's face twisted in horror as he clutched his neck, but blood poured out uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite being cursed, Marcus' blade was swift and deadly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Curse Weaver tried to say something, but no words came. His body collapsed to the ground, lifeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kid, you actually dare to kill one of my men in front of me? You've really signed your death warrant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eden's voice was seething with venom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without another word, he raised his hand, and it transformed into a monstrous claw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The claw tore through the air, breaking through everything in its path as it aimed to trap Marcus completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're cursed, you're as good as dead. Stop struggling, it's pointless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eden's face twisted into an expression of smug superiority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he swung the claw, he began chanting a dark incantation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The blood curse inside Marcus began to surge with renewed power, draining more of his blood and energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Marcus' life force drained away, Eden's aura grew stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was his way of feeding off his curse's effects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing the mangled limbs and the tortured souls locked in cages around him, Marcus' anger flared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He now understood how these Curse Weavers cultivated their power, and disgust bubbled up inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite the curse's relentless toll, Marcus refused to give in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a fierce roar, he activated the Timeless Numinous Energy, pushing his body to its absolute limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He launched a Thunderfire Punch, crashing it into Eden's claw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The clash sounded like a thunderous explosion, shaking the very ground beneath them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eden, using his advantage with the blood curse, managed to push Marcus back, forcing him to stagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Still not dead?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eden's eyes gleamed with madness as more cursed attacks shot toward Marcus, each one dripping with evil intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wasn't about to let Marcus catch his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus was pushed back again and again, but he refused to give up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drawing on all his strength, he unleashed his Timeless Numinous Energy and magic, striking back fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even under the weight of the curse, Marcus kept fighting, refusing to submit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eden's brows furrowed in surprise, clearly not expecting Marcus to be so resilient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, the other Curse Weavers didn't sit idly by. They launched their own attacks to back up Eden, surrounding Marcus with a relentless barrage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus, in the midst of counterattacking Eden, managed to cut down another Curse Weaver!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Looks like I'm going to have to pull out all the stops to finish you off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eden's blood-red eyes flashed with malice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Heavenly Punishment Blood Curse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Almost as soon as the words left his lips, a terrifying new blood curse totem materialized before him, dark and ominous.</span></p></div>
