        <h1>Chapter 420 Cal Really Woke Up!</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian thought he must have misheard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He barely registered Dr. Crawford's voice as he spoke firmly to Sophia. "Sophia, hurry up and open the ICU door for Mr. Fitzgerald!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sophia, still in shock, didn't dare to delay. She immediately obeyed and unlocked the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus stepped inside without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The conversation between them had caught the attention of Aniya and her daughter Ramona, who were now approaching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aniya, sensing something was amiss, asked, "What's going on here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sophia, still trying to process everything, replied, "The man who just went in, he's capable of treating Cal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aniya and Ramona exchanged a look, both wearing expressions of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That boy loves to talk big," Aniya said, scoffing. "Sophia, don't buy into his nonsense. I'm not wishing anything bad on Cal, but even Kingston's top experts couldn't do anything. I don't believe he's better than them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sophia, though, was less sure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dr. Crawford had remained silent about this stranger's abilities, and she didn't know who to believe. She stood back, unsure, waiting for the outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her gut instinct leaned toward skepticism&mdash;after all, this was a rare congenital heart condition, one that had reached a point where even the best doctors had given up hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, a young woman in her twenties approached them from the hallway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was about 5.4 feet with a slim, graceful figure, and an attractive face, with large, expressive eyes that seemed to convey emotions without needing words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wasn't wearing any designer clothes, but her understated elegance made her presence comfortable, almost soothing to the eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was Kiera, Ramona's daughter and Cal's aunt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had been downstairs for a meal and hadn't expected to find both her mother and Ramona here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We came to check on Cal," Aniya said, her eyes narrowing at Kiera.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She added, "Kiera, when it comes to men, you better keep your eyes open. Don't go for someone like Darian. He's really starting to drive me mad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera, ever the peacemaker, was quick to respond. "Mom, what's wrong now? Darian's a good guy, isn't he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unlike her mother, Kiera was empathetic and had always seen Darian as hardworking and kind to her sister. She considered him a good husband and father, despite the occasional conflict.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He's letting someone who isn't even a doctor into the ICU to treat Cal! How unreliable is that?" Aniya huffed, clearly frustrated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She proceeded to tell Kiera about Marcus in detail, of course, adding a bit of embellishment along the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera listened quietly, her expression thoughtful. She could see her mother's point&mdash;after all, Marcus didn't look like someone who could work medical miracles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Kiera also understood the importance of trying anything at this point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mom, let's not jump to conclusions. Cal's condition is already so bad. We've got nothing to lose by giving it a shot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you really going to defend him?" Aniya's voice grew sharper. "What if that kid fails? What will you say then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera met her mother's gaze with calm assurance. "Mom, Darian is Cal's father. I trust he's doing what he thinks is best. And if it doesn't work out, we'll still be here for Cal. Don't worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aniya's face darkened with a mix of anger and frustration. "You're so naive, Kiera. If that boy doesn't help Cal, I swear I'll tear Darian's mouth apart for defending him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite the harsh words, Darian stayed silent, squatting in the hallway, waiting quietly. He wasn't hopeful, but he didn't want to discourage the attempt either. Even with Dr. Crawford's earlier words, he still thought Marcus was simply wasting time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No more than ten minutes later, the ICU door opened once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus walked out, his expression calm and composed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian immediately stood and walked toward him. "Mr. Fitzgerald, I'm sorry for keeping you so long. We can go now&mdash;there's no need to trouble you further."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hadn't expected much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even with Dr. Crawford's backing, he couldn't shake the feeling that this was all just talk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well?" Aniya's voice cut through the tension, a challenge in her tone. "You said you could treat Cal. How did it go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' response was simple and unwavering. "Cal is fine now. You can go see for yourselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The words hung in the air, and everyone stood motionless for a moment. Cal's congenital heart condition was indeed very serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Marcus, when he was at Ancient Martial Art Stage Two, had already used Timeless Numinous Energy to treat advanced-stage cancer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, having advanced to the pinnacle of Ancient Martial Art Stage Five, healing congenital heart disease was no challenge for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, his words left everyone in the room frozen, unable to move or speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aside from Darian's family, even the young nurse Sophia couldn't help but widen her eyes in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her gaze quickly turned to Marcus, though it was filled with skepticism and even a hint of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ha! You sure know how to talk big," Aniya scoffed, clearly not buying into Marcus' claim. "I'm really curious to see how you plan to treat Cal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera, who had been quietly observing, stepped forward. "Mom, you stay here for a bit. I'll go check on Cal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera had been the one taking care of him at the hospital and knew him better than anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She worried her mother's presence might upset Cal, so she decided to go alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Kiera swiftly entered the ICU.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moments later, her voice rang out from within, full of surprise and joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It worked! Cal really woke up! Mom, Ramona, Darian&mdash;come quick, you've got to see this!"</span></p></div>
