  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, many people at the scene couldn't help but gasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They immediately understood the meaning behind his words&mdash;he was going to kill them to keep everything under wraps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people regretted their decision to stay here, convinced that losing their lives because of Marcus would be a real shame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiera's pretty face showed a deep worry. She never imagined that a simple dispute over a rented apartment would escalate to this point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, regret consumed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She regretted getting into it with Helen; if she hadn't, Marcus wouldn't have ended up in such a desperate situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hank was even more ruthless than they had imagined, bringing the State Tactical Force with him. Kiera wondered if the State Tactical Force took action, whether any of them could survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Helen stepped forward, her eyes locking onto Kiera, a smug smile spreading across her face. She said, "Bitch, do you finally realize how weak you are in front of me? It's all because of you that this man is in trouble. Do you regret your actions now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember this&mdash;you can never afford to cross me. If you kneel and apologize to me right now, maybe, just maybe, I'll have some mercy on you and ask my cousin to go easier on you, considering that you are young and stupid. Otherwise, no one can save you today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these words, everyone's gaze shifted to Kiera.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all wanted to know what Kiera would do in response to the opportunity Helen had given her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Hank, Dexter, and Helen enjoyed the moment of victory, Marcus suddenly asked, "Is the State Tactical Force really that strong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd froze once again and turned to look at Marcus with puzzled looks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dexter laughed and taunted, "Kid, are you so scared that you can't think straight? The State Tactical Force is almost like regular military forces. Now you know how strong they are. Think you can handle a heavy machine gun? Besides, only someone with my cousin's standing has the authority to command the State Tactical Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'd better just kneel and surrender. Otherwise, I'll make sure you're turned into Swiss cheese the next second!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as soon as Dexter finished speaking, a loud voice&mdash;amplified by a loudspeaker&mdash;echoed from outside the hallway, shaking the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen up, everyone in the hallway! You're surrounded. We're from the Solace Military Division. Lay down your weapons and surrender right now. If you don't, you will be treated as an enemy of the Uswad military!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone present was left dumbfounded and confused upon learning that the Solace Military Division had sent people here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Solace Military Division is a regular military force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They have a formidable, integrated capacity for sea, land, and air strikes that the State Tactical Force can't compare with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, they had deployed their troops and surrounded the entire building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people present couldn't help but wonder if a more important figure was here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Hank's face darkened. He took a loudspeaker from his secretary and walked to the window of the hallway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted into it, "This is Hank Foster, the the City Governor of Solomia. To the officers and soldiers of the Solace Military Division, is there a misunderstanding? Why are you surrounding this building?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Hank was the City Governor, he was still just a local official. He didn't have jurisdiction over military personnel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, the two sides belong to different administrative units and systems, and under normal circumstances, they tend to stay in their own lanes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The commander of the Solace Military Division is one rank above Hank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, the military holds power that local officials simply can't match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Hank could see through the window the Solace Military Division's commander, Ryker Zeller, and the deputy commander, Jareth, standing on the aerial ladder outside.</span></p><div class="pagination">
