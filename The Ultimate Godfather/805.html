        <h1>Chapter 791 Just Bragging-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Pablo and Arabella froze for a moment, their surprise evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged glances before focusing their attention back on Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arabella sneered, her tone dripping with contempt. "Who do you think you are, running your mouth in front of Mr. Ashford? You've got some nerve! Accusing him? You must've lost your mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Security, take this lunatic and that woman too. Get them out of here and straight to the police station! We don't need more trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her command, the guards immediately stepped forward, ready to seize Marcus and Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus let out a cold chuckle, his sharp eyes locking on Pablo. "Mr. Ashford, are these really the kind of people you employ? Barking orders and trying to silence anyone who dares speak? What are you so afraid of?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have to ask&mdash;what skeletons are hiding in your closet that make you so desperate to shut us up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pablo's expression darkened slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't anticipated that this young man would be so bold and articulate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trying to defuse the situation, Pablo raised a hand to halt the guards. "Look, young </span><span>man, I suggest you watch your words. You're throwing around baseless accusations. What exactly do you think I'm hiding?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But since you're so insistent, I'll humor you. Show me your evidence. Prove your claims. If you can't... well, don't blame me if things don't end well for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pablo's tone was measured, but his confidence was unmistakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His smug expression clearly conveyed that he didn't believe Marcus had anything on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason Pablo said this was simple&mdash;he was betting that Marcus wouldn't be able to produce any solid evidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcus failed to back up his accusations, Pablo would have the perfect excuse to take action against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And once that happened, even if Pablo resorted to extreme measures, no one would question his methods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had given Marcus a chance to prove his claims, and if Marcus still insisted on pushing forward recklessly, he would have no one to blame but himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd murmured among themselves, some already piecing together Pablo's strategy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His maneuvering was subtle but brutal&mdash;the kind of political skill honed over decades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the hallmark of someone who could destroy a person without leaving a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, you said it yourself," Marcus replied casually, a hint of a smirk playing on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pablo nodded, not missing a beat. "Yes, I did. And I'm a man of my word. Now, let's see your evidence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd's attention shifted entirely to Marcus. Some people exchanged skeptical </span><span>glances,</span><span> their expressions tinged with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To most of them, Marcus looked like an ordinary young man. They couldn't fathom how he had the audacity&mdash;or the means&mdash;to challenge someone as powerful as Pablo Ashford.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pablo wasn't just a high-ranking official; he was the son of Julian </span><span>Ashford,</span><span> a senior government figure whose influence spanned across </span><span>Uswad</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ashford family's power was practically untouchable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A single command from Pablo could ruin anyone's life without so much as a whisper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, here was this bold, unknown young man, standing his ground as if he were oblivious to the danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Marcus pulled out his phone and connected it to the lobby's projector system.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In moments, the large screen displayed an email Diana had sent him earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the lobby could see it clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The email was packed with damning evidence, detailing how Pablo had fabricated charges against Benjamin, including false documents and deliberate manipulation of the investigation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gasps rippled through the crowd as people leaned in to read the details.</span></p></div>
