  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled, "It's not just about being cured. You can try it yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia quickly turned to her internal vision method, and to her amazement, she realized her body had miraculously healed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More astonishingly, her realm had significantly increased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had only experienced this state from his father or Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was simply incredible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia even thought she was dreaming, but after checking again, she found that it was all real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This strange affliction has afflicted the Nuer Tribe for thousands of years, and no one has managed to cure it. How did you do it?" she asked, astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's simple. What you have isn't a disease," Marcus replied with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it's not a disease, then what is it?" Nadia inquired, intrigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Cursed Power, a type embedded in your Nuer Tribe genes," he explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This curse not only threatens your organs but also stifles your potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've just helped you eliminate the curse's power in your body. Your level increase is due to the potential you already possess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Without the curse limiting you, your potential will be unleashed, and your level will rise immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia's eyes sparkled with realization, and she regarded Marcus with newfound respect. "Everyone in the tribe says humans are deceitful and have plotted against us, but you seem different. You're a good person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Marcus could respond, the door swung open, and Ashton entered with his son, visibly angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lionel exclaimed, "You said healing would take an hour. It's been an hour and twenty minutes. Is Nadia healed yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was scrutinizing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Should Marcus fail to cure Nadia, Lionel would have no hesitation in confronting him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashton felt similarly, which is why he let Marcus save Nadia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed Marcus felt powerless against her strange disease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While waiting outside, they were already impatient to catch Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Lionel's glare froze upon seeing Nadia standing beside Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Princess Nadia, you're awake?" he stammered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia nodded gently. "Yes, this gentleman saved me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her declaration, Ashton and Lionel stood in disbelief, their expressions frozen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a disease that had clung to the Nuer Tribe for millennia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashton's ancestors had always been doctors to the Nuer Tribe, but they had never found a cure for the strange disease that plagued them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Raphael's daughter, Nadia, fell victim to this affliction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the young man before them had miraculously cured her in just over an hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nadia, my daughter, you're really cured!" Raphael exclaimed, gripping her hand in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Father, not only am I better, but my realm has also improved! You won't believe it!" Nadia replied, her face lighting up with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raphael immediately used his Cultivation Manuals to check.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After getting the result, his weathered and deep eyes froze, filled with disbelief!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nadia, your realm has truly risen by four levels! How is this possible? Am I dreaming?" he stammered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Nuer Tribe had its unique cultivation system, which was similar to that of the human world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Advancing through the realms became increasingly difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raphael remembered it took him nearly 30 years to progress from level three to level seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, his 18-year-old daughter had not only recovered from the disease but had also achieved a miraculous breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His astonishment drew the attention of the rest of the Nuer Tribe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They also released their auras to check Nadia's realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The results obtained were surprisingly consistent with what Raphael said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, everyone's expressions were completely stunned, their bodies were petrified, and they felt like they were dreaming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Princess Nadia really broke through four realms in a row! What on earth is happening?" a senior member of the tribe exclaimed, reflecting the shock shared by all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nadia, how did you achieve this breakthrough?" Raphael asked, regaining their composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia gratefully glanced at Marcus and explained, "I owe my breakthrough to this gentleman, who lifted the Cursed Power from my body, allowing me to advance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then detailed Marcus' insights about the disease, leaving the crowd in stunned silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan was equally astonished, her eyes fixed on Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was not particularly optimistic about Marcus' ability to cure the diseases.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the situation forced her to this point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her surprise, Marcus not only successfully cured Nadia's disease, but also found out the specific cause of the disease and helped her break through 4 levels in succession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was simply a miracle for Susan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, you saved my daughter. I will never forget your kindness," Raphael said, approaching Marcus. "I previously spoke disrespectfully to you. Can you forgive me? I sincerely apologize."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bowed deeply, showing utmost respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved him off, saying, "It was a simple matter, Mr. Stewart. No need for such formality."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus still had no intention of bowing to Raphael, but no one felt it inappropriate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus saved Nadia's life and was a great benefactor of their tribe. He deserved the most honorable treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, is what you said about Cursed Power true?" Raphael inquired, eager for answers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcus' claims were valid, then as the chief of the tribe, it was his duty to help the tribe find a way to lift the Cursed Power.</span></p><div class="pagination">
