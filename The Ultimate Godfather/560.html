  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost simultaneously, the 5th generation cyborgs launched their assault on Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their arms shifted, instantly transforming into laser cannons, unleashing a barrage of energy blasts faster than the eye could follow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of these laser cannons far exceeded that of any standard assault rifle, and </span><span>their speed was equally unmatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, a storm of lasers sliced through the air, heading straight for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, the unmistakable sound of helicopters echoed from the void above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several heavily armed Black Hawk helicopters streaked in from the distance, opening fire with their mounted heavy machine guns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the entire area was transformed into a deadly web of destruction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waves of fiery death rained down on Marcus, surrounding him with annihilation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smile tugged at the corner of Marcus' lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The 5th generation cyborgs were indeed formidable, but these Black Hawk Legion operatives clearly still thought of him as the same Marcus they had faced during his time at Ancient Martial Art Stage Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, if he'd been caught in such a vicious siege, he likely wouldn't have stood a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now... his cultivation had long surpassed that level. He had already ascended to Ancient Martial Art Stage </span><span>Seven,</span><span> his strength having undergone a complete transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To put it simply, those cyborgs now seemed like nothing more than scrap metal in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his full mind focused, Marcus effortlessly dodged the lasers as they screamed toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, he calmly reached for his trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air hummed with the sound of rapid fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had pulled out a compact submachine gun, aiming it at the attacking helicopters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each shot was a devastating beam of destruction, impossibly precise and unstoppable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the helicopters, it was a death sentence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Explosions rocked the sky as one helicopter after another was blasted out of the air, erupting in massive fireballs that lit up the heavens like falling stars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within minutes, all of the helicopters had been reduced to smoldering wreckage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching this unfold, Aquila and the other Black Hawk Legion leaders couldn't hide the shock and disbelief on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had never expected Marcus, surrounded by a whole army of 5th generation cyborgs, to not only dodge their relentless assault with ease but also destroy their helicopters without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how they looked at it, this guy's power was clearly beyond Ancient Martial Art Stage Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aquila's mind raced. Could he really have broken through to Stage Seven already?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that thought was quickly dismissed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given Marcus' age, it was already a miracle that he had reached Stage Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A month ago, Aquila had confirmed that Marcus was still at that level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way he could've made such a rapid leap in that short a time. Impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take him down! Tear this damn guy to pieces!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aquila barked the order to the 5th generation cyborgs, their last and final trump card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cyborgs responded immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their bodies morphed once again, each one evolving into something even more terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some transformed into giant beasts, others into towering armored warriors, and a few became massive weapons in and of themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They unleashed a storm of attacks&mdash;lightning bolts, searing lasers, and blasts of flame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each one was far more destructive than anything a conventional weapon could produce, and their speed was beyond anything imaginable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, Marcus found himself surrounded by waves of annihilation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he wasn't even slightly fazed. With a thought, the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire surged through him, enveloping his body in a terrifying aura of Timeless Numinous Energy, crackling with raw power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within that energy, the searing pulse of </span><span>Thunderfire</span><span> Power was alive, ready to explode at a moment's notice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every movement of his hands, every punch he threw, was a weapon capable of obliterating anything in its path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first cyborg, caught in the path of Marcus' devastating fist, didn't stand a chance. It was torn apart in an instant, its body disintegrating in a burst of fiery explosions, leaving only ash in the wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other side, two more cyborgs fired off their own monstrous attacks&mdash;one with a bolt of lightning, the other with a stream of fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their combined power was overwhelming, aimed directly at Marcus with the intention of eradicating him on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus barely flinched. He shot out two powerful counterpunches, each one unstoppable and crushing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, both cyborgs' heads exploded, their skulls reduced to nothing but vaporized debris.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost simultaneously, one of the high-ranking members of Black Hawk Legion reached for a special sidearm, hoping to catch Marcus off guard with a sneak attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could even pull the trigger, a thunderbolt descended from above, striking him down in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crack of thunder rang out, and that officer was vaporized, reduced to nothing more than a charred corpse in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining leaders of the Black Hawk Legion turned </span><span>pale,</span><span> their faces filled with disbelief. They hadn't just seen Marcus dodge their attacks&mdash;they had witnessed him wielding the powers of a Wizard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And his reflexes were even faster than they'd anticipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you're a Stage Seven Ancient Martial Art expert?!" one of them stammered, his voice trembling with fear as he felt Marcus' overwhelming presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't even spare him a glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a single step forward, the </span><span>Thunderfire</span><span> Power swirling around his body as his </span><span>fists crackled with Timeless Numinous Energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He launched forward with brutal speed, sending two massive punches directly at the two remaining 5th generation cyborgs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cyborgs roared in defiance, unleashing their most powerful attacks to block his assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But their strikes were nothing&mdash;nothing&mdash;against Marcus' fury. His fists smashed through their defenses like they were made of paper.</span></p><div class="pagination">
