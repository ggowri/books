  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nash's hands were cuffed. He struggled to retrieve his phone with one hand and quickly dialed a number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, they were going to arrest me. They said they would send me to a m</span><span>ilitary tribunal. Please come quickly, or they'll take me away!" Nash cried through his tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nash had always been confident in his father's influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew well that his father was not an ordinary general, and his connections in the military were unmatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nash believed his father would surely find someone even more powerful than Marcus to save him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who was it that planned to arrest you and send you to a military tribunal? Tell me every detail!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rodger Holden's deep voice came through the phone, filled with authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nash recounted everything that had happened in the restaurant, not hesitating to add a few exaggerations along the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being Rodger's only son, he had always been pampered since childhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought that by sharing his ordeal, Rodger would comfort him and do everything possible to rescue him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never expected that, after his story was finished, a furious roar would echo through the phone. "You brat, did you say you offended Special Advisor Marcus?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nash answered awkwardly, "Yes, Dad. I didn't know who he was before, so I was a bit disrespectful with my words. But even if I was wrong, it hardly deserves sending me to a military tribunal. Dad, please help me. I am your only son!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rodger's voice trembled as he replied, "You could offend anyone in the world, but not Marcus. Marcus was the man Commander Ashford valued above all. His power is equivalent to the military district commander. You were in the wrong, so sending you to a military tribunal was perfectly natural. How am I supposed to save you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rodger had already heard of Marcus' reputation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In all of Uswad, Marcus was the only one who had been directly promoted from an ordinary man to a major general.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he had just learned that, because of Marcus, Julian had dismissed his own son Pablo from his post as office director just yesterday.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian could even dismiss his own son, which clearly showed Marcus' standing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why Rodger had gone to great lengths to transfer his son to the Special Advisor Department.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Working beside someone as influential would let him share in the glory. He was paving a road to success for his son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rodger believed that one day the Special Advisor Department would hold a significant position in Uswad's military.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt that if his son worked there, his future would be limitless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rodger never imagined that after using all his connections to get Nash in, Nash would offend Marcus. It was almost like courting his own demise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing his father's words, Nash completely broke down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His final hope shattered, and he sank into despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but ask, "Dad, what should I do now? Do you really want me to face a military tribunal and spend the rest of my life behind bars?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rodger sighed and said, "Stay still. I will come over immediately. I'll plead with Mr. Fitzgerald. If he refuses to forgive you, then you'll have no choice but to face the tribunal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Rodger hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nash, what's going on? Is your father furious and about to come to rescue us?" Kenia asked eagerly as she noticed Nash had ended the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without warning, Nash raised his hand and struck Kenia hard on the side of her face. He snarled, "You bitch, how dare you talk to me! If it weren't for you, I would never have offended Mr. Fitzgerald. You're nothing but a jinx. Don't ever speak to me again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia was stunned and couldn't recover for a long while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she finally gathered herself, she burst into tears and pleaded, "Nash, how can you treat me like this? You once promised you'd love me forever, and now you hit me. You're such a heartless man!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nash slapped her again without mercy. "I hit you because I wanted to. You are nothing but a jinx!" he spat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone present couldn't help but feel a deep sense of helplessness at the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had once seen the two as a loving couple, but now their relationship had soured in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nash's blows were fierce and unrelenting, leaving no doubt of his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Grace could no longer stand by. As a woman, she felt sympathy for Kenia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at Marcus, silently wondering if he might one day turn abusive like Nash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The murmurs among the onlookers grew louder. No one had expected these two to fall apart so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a luxurious military vehicle pulled up and parked at the restaurant entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A middle-aged man, dressed in full military uniform with prominent shoulder insignia and graying hair, stepped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hurriedly pushed open the restaurant door and walked inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Accompanying him were several young soldiers in uniform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man began scanning the crowd as soon as he entered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he spotted Nash, who was still handcuffed. He strode over and delivered a kick to Nash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nash screamed in agony. He was sent sprawling to the ground and howled in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers gasped in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected him to strike so viciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An ordinary person would hardly have survived such a blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You brat! You were always causing trouble for me. How dare you offend Mr. Fitzgerald! You are too bold! Apologize to Mr. Fitzgerald immediately, or I will personally ruin you for him!" roared the man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Nash's father, Rodger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he pulled a pistol from his waist and aimed it directly at Nash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nash, still writhing in pain, looked at his father with a trace of defiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never been hit by Rodger before. He never imagined his own father would be so ruthless to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The searing pain fueled a growing resentment toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Nash hesitated, Rodger pulled the trigger. A bullet struck Nash's calf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nash screamed once more and could bear it no longer. He collapsed to his knees in front of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brat, are you deaf? If you do not apologize to Mr. Fitzgerald, I will break your other leg too!" Rodger growled through gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slowly, he aimed the gun at Nash's other leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nash was terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he finally understood that his father was completely serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that if he did not apologize, it might not be just his legs that would be broken. He feared that today his father might even end his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Struggling to move, Nash lowered his head toward Marcus and pleaded, "Mr. Fitzgerald, I was arrogant and disrespected you. I was wrong, and I promise never to do it again. Please, forgive me!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
