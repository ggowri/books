  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The night was alive in the Mountaintop Villa District, where an all-night party raged in a luxurious ma</span><span>nor</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the pool, Anthony lounged shirtless on a massive couch, rocking the beach boy look. Two blondes were draped over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hands roamed their chests freely, making all kinds of dirty noises.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a far cry from the composed, powerful figure he cut during the day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That Marcus has caught the Godfather's attention. Mr. Roger Gellar wants him gone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laird Sable, decked out in a light suit and shades, downed his wine before dropping this bomb on Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony shoved the girls aside, a look of surprise crossing his face. "</span><span>What? </span><span>That loser Marcus is connected to the Godfather?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laird nodded. "Mr. Gellar's digging shows Marcus is probably the Godfather's bastard son. If he lives, he'll challenge Mr. Gellar's inheritance. He needs to die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony smirked. "</span><span>Don</span><span>'</span><span>t worry about</span><span> it. I've already sent Falcon to kill him before Mr. Gellar even gave the command. </span><span>By my plans, h</span><span>e should be dead</span><span> </span><span>now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laird nodded approvingly. "</span><span>That</span><span>'</span><span>s the best. </span><span>I'll tell Mr. Gellar about your initiative. I'm sure he'll reward you handsomely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony hastily brushed a hand through his hair. "Thank you very much, sir!" he exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly pleased with himself, he pulled the two beauties back into his arms, his hands wandering to their sweet spots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as the party was heating up again, an icy voice cut in. "You won't be getting any reward."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony and Laird sobered up instantly. They turned to find the source.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they laid eyes on Marcus, shock rippled through them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you're not dead?" Anthony stared in disbelief, rubbing his eyes to erase the scene before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Falcon is a trained warrior, and his skills far surpass those of ordinary men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Most of my bodyguards couldn't beat him, even in groups.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No way should Marcus have survived his hit!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How the hell is he still breathing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He will ruin all my plans!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus walked toward him. "You thought a few killers could take me out? Dream on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony trembled</span><span> at his words</span><span>. Each of Marcus' steps felt like a death knell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Somebody! Kill him, now!" Anthony screamed, panic lacing his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A pack of armed guards rushed forward, ready to take action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus didn't even slow down. He kept moving like a man on a mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards who attacked dropped in seconds, their blood splashing across the white marble pool deck. The air grew thick with the metallic scent of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing Marcus' deadly presence, Anthony's earlier bravado melted into pure fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus slid into the seat next to him. Without a word, he pulled out a contract and slammed it down. "Sign it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's eyes went wide as he read the document. It was an equity transfer contract.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want my 25% equity? Hell no!" he yelled, jerking back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' patience was wearing thin. He grabbed Anthony's wrist and pinned it to the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Anthony could move, Marcus picked up a wine bottle and brought it crashing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>CRACK!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony's hand was smashed into a bloody pulp. The pain was unbearable, his scream piercing the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus leaned in close, his voice a deadly whisper. "Want to sign now?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
