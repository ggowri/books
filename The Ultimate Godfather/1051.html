        <h1>Chapter 951 Callum Finch</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley didn't waste a second. He tapped into the magic manual he'd been training with, a faint shimmer of power rippling around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He funneled it straight into his fist, juicing it up until it felt like a whole new beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a guttural roar, he swung hard, unleashing a blazing punch straight at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guy was built like a tank&mdash;broad shoulders, ripped from head to toe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd boxed for years before this; even without the magic, most punks couldn't get within arm's reach of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with that mystical edge boosting his swing, it hit like a pro fighter's&mdash;damn near Warrior-level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No regular one could take that kind of heat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's why Stanley didn't give Marcus a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"See that, punk?" he barked mid-swing, cranking the power even higher, aiming to end it in one shot. "This is what I can do with a flick of my wrist. Let's see you try&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus just smirked, cool as ice. He didn't dodge, didn't flinch&mdash;just hauled off and slapped Stanley clean across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crack. The sound cut through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' hand blew right past Stanley's glowing fist like it was nothing, landing square on his cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley let out a howl, his bulk flying sideways.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spun through the air a good few times before crashing down hard, his face already swelling purple, blood and broken teeth spilling out. He looked like roadkill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett and Chloe stood there, mouths hanging open. They couldn't believe Marcus had taken Stanley apart that easy&mdash;like swatting a fly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One smack and the guy were a mess. Marcus was on another level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What, this your big move?" Marcus said, his voice dripping with mockery as he eyed Stanley's sprawled-out wreck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley clutched his busted face, rolling on the ground, groans turning into full-on wails.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took him a solid minute to stagger back up, glaring at Marcus through the pain. "You've got some nerve, hitting me like that. Who the hell are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even as cocky as he was, Stanley knew now&mdash;Marcus wasn't just some nobody. No regular guy could pull that off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The one running Serpent's Coil," Marcus said, flat and matter-of-fact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley blinked, then barked out a laugh, all scorn. "Oh, you're full of it now, huh?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know who's really in charge of Serpent's Coil? Mr. Fitzgerald's a legend&mdash;you think you can name-drop him like that? You're digging your own grave, punk!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald?" Chloe caught the name from a few feet away, her mind spinning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Same last name as Marcus. No way it's that much of a coincidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley didn't notice her muttering. He yanked a dagger from his belt and lunged, the blade flashing toward Marcus' chest with lethal intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't even blink&mdash;just slapped him again, this time on the other cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hit ignored the knife, sending Stanley spinning back to the pavement with an even louder scream, clutching his face as he writhed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dragged himself up, eyes blazing. "You're dead, punk! I'm getting our boss&mdash;see how you like it when he tears you apart!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he stumbled off, propped up by his goons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett saw the tide turning and bolted after them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe's stomach sank. This was spiraling fast. "Marcus, they're going for Serpent's Coil's top dog. Maybe we should lay low?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've heard they've taken over Solomia's underground scene lately&mdash;biggest crew around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If their boss shows up with his heavy hitters, what if something goes wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't signed up for this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It started as a family spat&mdash;now it was Marcus versus Serpent's Coil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he got hurt because of her, she'd never forgive herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Relax," Marcus said, unfazed. "I've been waiting for their boss. I want to know who's letting them run wild with drugs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe's brows shot up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait&mdash;don't tell me you're actually the head of Serpent's Coil."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd thought he was joking before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serpent's Coil was Solomia's top underworld outfit&mdash;Marcus had never even hinted at a connection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have I ever lied to you?" he said with a sly grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe's eyes flickered, but she stayed quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was dead-set on facing them down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another fight was coming, and all she could do was hope he'd come out on top.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, Stanley and Everett rolled back in, with a pack of Serpent's Coil's muscle in tow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leading them was a lean guy in his early thirties&mdash;short, but built like he lived in the gym, every inch of him screaming pro athlete. Callum Finch, the boss Stanley had been yapping about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's the dumbass that roughed you up?" Callum's voice carried weight, his strut oozing confidence as he glanced at Stanley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley's face was a swollen mess&mdash;barely recognizable after Marcus' double whammy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He jabbed a finger at Marcus. "That's the guy, Callum. Don't let him off easy, or Serpent's Coil's gonna be a laughingstock!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Callum turned toward Marcus, ready to unload a string of curses&mdash;then froze mid-breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes locked on Marcus' face, widening in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Callum, this clown's been running his mouth, saying he's Serpent's Coil's big shot," Stanley pressed, annoyed at the delay. "If we've got a boss like him, we're screwed. Take him out already!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smack! Callum's hand cracked across Stanley's face before he could finish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hit was brutal, piling onto Stanley's already wrecked mug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He crumpled, howling, and stared up in shock. "Callum, why me? I didn't screw up&mdash;it's that guy you should be hitting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Callum's fury only spiked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stormed over and laid into Stanley&mdash;fists and boots flying, each blow landing like a sledgehammer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In seconds, Stanley was a bruised heap, squealing like a stuck pig. "Callum, talk to me! There's gotta be a mix-up&mdash;don't do this!"</span></p></div>
