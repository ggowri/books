        <h1>Chapter 847 Don't You Like Me Like This?-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, tell me, do you have other identities?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade asked as she ate, her beautiful eyes twinkling with curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more time she spent with Marcus, the more she realized that despite revealing more about himself, he only seemed more mysterious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt like she could never fully see through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I do have other identities," Marcus said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a sip of ice-cold beer, a look of satisfaction appearing on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are they?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade's curiosity deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come closer, and I'll tell you," Marcus said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade leaned her face in immediately. Marcus suddenly kissed her soft lips, then whispered in her ear, "I'm your boyfriend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade's body trembled slightly, her face turning a deep shade of red. She glared at Marcus and scolded, "Marcus, you're so bad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus licked his lips and grinned. "Don't you like me like this? Isn't </span><span>that</span><span> right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade rolled her eyes at him but didn't dare to speak again. She simply continued eating her delicious skewers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, a faint sweetness bloomed in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back when Ronald had forced her into that situation, she had felt utterly helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had even considered that if Aiden truly forced her to do something beyond her limits, she would have no choice but to end her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wouldn't have had the courage to face Marcus again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just when she had been at her lowest, the man in her heart had appeared. And with overwhelming strength, he had stood before her, crushing everyone who had tried to harm her beneath his feet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That feeling of being protected was exactly what Jade had always longed for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After everything that had happened today, Jade had given her heart to Marcus&mdash;completely and without reservation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, they finished their meal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus turned to Jade and asked, "Where are you staying? I'll take you home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade hesitated before saying, "Since this is a business trip, I'm staying at the same hotel as Ronald and the others. But I don't want to go back... I don't want to see them again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' gaze swept over Jade's flawless figure, and he teased, "Then, Ms. Kelly, would you be willing to share a room with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words carried a playful tone and were actually a quote from a famous warlord in </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> ancient history.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade immediately understood his meaning, and her face turned even redder. "I.</span><span>..I</span><span> don't want to..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus suddenly pulled her into his arms and asked domineeringly, "What did you say? Say it again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Marcus' handsome face so close to hers, Jade's heart pounded uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't resist any longer. He lowered his head and kissed her inviting lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Mmm</span><span>..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were standing on a busy street, and Jade was incredibly nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body trembled slightly as she punched Marcus' chest with her fists. "Marcus, stop it! We're in public... What if someone sees us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled and whispered in her ear, "Then tell me, do you want to stay with me tonight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade blushed deeply but eventually nodded. "I do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's more like it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus grinned, wrapped an arm around her slender waist, and hailed a taxi, heading straight for the hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once inside the room, Jade was visibly nervous. Marcus pulled her into his embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade stammered, "I.</span><span>..I'll</span><span> take a shower first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she quickly rushed into the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the sound of running water filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the frosted glass, Marcus could clearly see her graceful silhouette.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes gleamed as an idea popped into his head. Without hesitation, he stripped off his clothes and stepped into the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade let out a startled cry. "Marcus... What are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to shower too. It saves time. Let's do it together," Marcus said with a mischievous smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Jade's perfect figure, his desire surged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade's body was already wet, her smooth skin glistening with water droplets, exuding an irresistible allure.</span></p></div>
