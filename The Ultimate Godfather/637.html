        <h1>Chapter 636 Taking the Strike</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In truth, Marcus had not intentionally set out to do this since he had reached Ancient Martial Stage Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the world of Ancient Martial Art, aside from those who had transcended Foundation Establishment Stage, it was rare to find an opponent who could challenge him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had merely casually released his energy, and the surveillance systems in the area malfunctioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Aston Martin was now running toward Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as he was cruising along a coastal road, coercion descended from the void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the surrounding space was enveloped, and the force of the coercion was so intense that it surpassed Ancient Martial Stage Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The area became heavy, as though even the air had stopped moving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus tensed up, parking his car on the side of the road, when a cold voice echoed from the void. "Guy, you killed a member of Celestial Arc Order. Today, pay with your life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A figure began to materialize. This person was dressed in a golden robe, with three long wisps of beard flowing in the wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He appeared to be in his fifties, looking ethereal and mysterious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Millet, the leader of Celestial Arc Order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, Ada and Colby of Celestial Arc Order had both come to kill Marcus. Colby was slain by Marcus, and Ada lost her chastity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Millet was enraged by the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided to kill Marcus and avenge Colby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada had strongly opposed this decision because she had witnessed Marcus' formidable strength firsthand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After their Dual Cultivation, she reached Ancient Martial Stage Seven, but Marcus' power was still something she couldn't resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was in awe, knowing that even their leader was no match for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Millet was not convinced. He arrogantly insisted on coming alone to kill Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was unaware that Marcus had already advanced to Ancient Martial Stage Eight, a realm far beyond what he could contend with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To ensure his safety, Ada followed him in secret. She was now observing from the shadows, ready to help when necessary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't get it," Marcus sighed, "Why do people from Celestial Arc Order keep coming after me and ending up dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Millet froze, then scoffed, "Guy, do you think you can beat me just because you killed Colby? If that's the case, then you are truly naive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He unleashed his energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had reached the minor completion stage of Ancient Martial Stage Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he waved his hand, a beam of destructive light shot across the void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power was immense, and its speed was astonishing. In the blink of an eye, it was already in front of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus did not care in the least. He waved his arm casually, releasing an invisible force that shattered the destructive beam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Millet was shocked by his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped forward, and the special techniques of Celestial Arc Order were activated. A brilliant glow of energy surrounded him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, he appeared in front of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His palm, surrounded by destructive patterns, seemed to form an ancient totem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thrust his palm forward, slamming it toward Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus stood calmly in place, and his body glowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took the strike without batting an eyelid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact reverberated across the air, and Millet smirked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He poured more energy into his strike, hoping to annihilate Marcus in one blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he felt an irresistible force radiate from Marcus. It repelled his strike, and Marcus still stood calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, the shockwave swept over and directly hit Millet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With another explosion, Millet was thrown backward, and his body was sent flying several dozen feet before he could stabilize himself. His chest churned, and he coughed up blood. His face turned ashen.</span></p></div>
