  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I have to admit, you've done a pretty damn good job pretending. Most people wouldn't be able to pull it off," Ewan sneered, his eyes narrowing. "Tell me, did you take acting lessons? How else could you fake it so well?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Marcus could respond, Quinton, standing next to Ewan, spoke up, his tone impatient. "Hayden, let's not waste time with this guy. If he doesn't want to cut off his own arm, you might as well do it for him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hayden gave a low laugh, his gaze still fixed on Marcus. "I gave you a chance to make the right move, but now I'm about to take it out of your hands. It's not just going to be your arm at stake anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Hayden spoke, several of his men drew guns, the cold steel of the barrels aimed straight at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The tension in the air was palpable, but before anyone could make a move, Hayden's phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His expression faltered for a split second, irritation flashing across his face. Who the hell was calling him at a time like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But when he saw the caller ID, his anger dissipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly straightened up, switching to a respectful tone. "Blake, the deal in Solomia is wrapped up. What can I do for you?" Hayden greeted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To his surprise, Blake's voice came through the phone loud and furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Goddammit, don't talk to me about business! Where the hell are you right now? Tell me, now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hayden's body stiffened. Sweat beaded on his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly lowered his voice, trying to remain composed. "Blake, I'm still in Solomia, just heading out to take care of a few things."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You think you can pull some shit without me knowing?" Blake's voice was filled with venom. "Answer me now&mdash;did you take that job on your own, or am I going to have to come back and fix your mess?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The intensity in Blake's tone sent a shiver down Hayden's spine. This was bad. Hayden's mind raced. This wasn't just about breaking the rules&mdash;it was about something far worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't help but glance at Marcus, his mind racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Was it really just a coincidence?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus had just made a phone call, and somehow, Blake knew about his unsanctioned mission almost instantly. The timing was too perfect&mdash;too convenient to be believed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He swallowed hard and tried to placate Blake, his voice trembling slightly. "Blake, I thought it was just a simple job to make some extra cash for the gang. I didn't mean to overstep. Please, for the sake of all the things I've done for the gang, I beg you, forgive me this time..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You think I give a damn about money? No, you've crossed the line," Blake's voice cut through the phone like a blade. "You've pissed off someone you shouldn't have, and you have no idea who you're dealing with! You've gone after Mr. Fitzgerald, the one man in Kingston I have to bow down to! You want to cut his arm off?! Are you out of your mind?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hayden's heart dropped, his legs almost buckling under him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He never imagined that Hayden's ill-advised mission would end up crossing paths with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was as if Hayden had chosen to stir up trouble on the very ground of the devil himself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Blake had witnessed Marcus' terrifying power firsthand, and now, with this blunder, the consequences could be catastrophic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Marcus took offense, it wasn't just Hayden who'd pay the price&mdash;Blake, as the gang leader, would be dragged down with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Boom!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Blake's words struck Hayden like a thunderclap, reverberating in his ears with a force that left him paralyzed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For a moment, Hayden thought he had misheard. His body trembled, his mind struggling to process the gravity of what had just been said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Blake, please..." Hayden stammered, his voice barely audible. "There's no Mr. Fitzgerald here. I only have some Solomia hick in front of me. I don't know what you're talking about."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You think I'm stupid? I'm counting to three, Hayden. You better listen. Kneel. Apologize to Mr. Fitzgerald. Cut off your employer's hands if you want to survive this. If you don't, it won't just be you&mdash;Axe Gang is going down with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hayden's blood ran cold. Blake wasn't just angry&mdash;he was livid. The fear in his voice was evident. He knew Blake's wrath could tear him apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before he could even respond, the phone slipped from his hand, clattering to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hayden, what the hell's going on?" one of his men asked, confusion evident in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hayden spun around, his frustration boiling over. He slapped the man across the face hard, snarling, "What the hell do you think is going on? Shut the hell up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quinton, noticing the change in Hayden's demeanor, cautiously stepped forward. "Hayden, what's happening? Do you need us to handle something?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The question set Hayden off completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His rage flared, and without thinking, he drew his gun and fired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A single shot rang out, and Quinton screamed in pain as blood sprayed from his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He staggered, clutching his wound, eyes wide with confusion. "Hayden, what the hell? Why are you shooting me? I'm on your side, not his!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ewan froze, wide-eyed in shock. Despite his reputation as a combat champion, he knew better than to face a man with a gun. His bravado evaporated in the face of real danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's you two idiots who made me do this!" Hayden raged, his voice full of venom. "You've gotten me into a mess with the wrong people! Get these two on the ground&mdash;beat them senseless and take their arms. Let them remember this lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The men, still in a daze from the sudden shift, reluctantly obeyed. They grabbed Ewan and Quinton, pinning them to the ground, ready to deliver the brutal punishment Hayden had ordered.</span></p><div class="pagination">
