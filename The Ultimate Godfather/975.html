  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jareth's voice rang out, "As the </span><span>City Governer</span><span> of the city, you have illegally mobilized the armed police and attempted to threaten a high-ranking military official. As officers of the military command in this city, it is our duty to ensure the safety of military personnel and neutralize any threats to national security. Any resistance will be met with lethal force, regardless of who you are!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weight of his words sent a chilling wave through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were two key takeaways from Jareth's statement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First, there was an important military figure inside this building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The presence of heavily armed troops from the military command made it clear&mdash;they were here to protect this individual at all costs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Second, if</span><span> Governer</span><span> Hank Foster refused to back down, they had the legal authority to eliminate him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing this, the onlookers gasped, never imagining that the military would not only surround the building but do so with such determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was even more shocking was the fact that there was a key military figure inside this building&mdash;yet, how had they missed him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This building, constructed in the 1990s, had only one unit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And all the residents were currently gathered in the hallway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they hadn't seen any sign of the so-called important military figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Dexter Gibson and the overweight woman&mdash;his wife Helen exchanged confused glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were both wondering the same thing: Where was this person?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From outside, Hank's voice echoed through a loudspeaker, addressing </span><span>Ryker</span><span> and Jareth on the tactical ladder. "Commander </span><span>Zeller</span><span>, Deputy Commander Falkner, is there some kind of misunderstanding? We may be from different branches of the government, but we've never had any major conflicts before. Today, I am handling an important matter that required me to deploy the police. As the </span><span>City Governor</span><span>, if I don't even have the authority to enforce order, then what's the point of my position? Yet here you are, surrounding me and citing the presence of some so-called high-ranking military official&mdash;this is a blatant violation of civil-military relations! I will take this matter directly to the federal authorities!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hank's ability to stay composed was impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being surrounded by so many from the military, he didn't flinch and even had the audacity to counterattack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words were also difficult to refute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the military base technically held higher jurisdiction than the city government, they operated under separate chains of command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryker</span><span> and Jareth's sudden military deployment did seem like an overreach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, </span><span>Ryker</span><span> showed no hesitation. His voice carried absolute authority as he responded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Governor </span><span>Foster, there is no misunderstanding. We are here for one reason only&mdash;to protect a high-ranking military official.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And based on your recent actions against this individual, we have full authority to place you under arrest and bring you before a military tribunal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was stunned once again. Who was this person?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hank's expression darkened as he demanded, "Commander </span><span>Zeller</span><span>, I don't understand. I have always been cautious in my dealings&mdash;when would I have ever offended such a person? Who exactly is this high-ranking officer you speak of?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or are you fabricating a charge just to take me down?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, </span><span>Ryker</span><span> turned toward Marcus in the hallway, his expression shifting to one of deep respect. "This man right here," he said solemnly, "is the important figure you've just offended. </span><span>Governer</span><span> Forster, not only have you disrespected this person, but you have also directly endangered his safety. Your crime is far more severe than simply facing a tribunal&mdash;it may not be something you can walk away from."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment these words were spoken, it was as if a bolt of lightning struck the minds of everyone present.</span></p><div class="pagination">
