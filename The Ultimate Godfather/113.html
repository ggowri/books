  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The preacher spoke politely, his tone carrying a hint of reverence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This Mr. Fitzgerald is the Godfather's third son. You almost made a catastrophic mistake&mdash;do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana revealed Marcus's identity without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lead preacher's expression instantly shifted to one of shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately ordered his subordinates to stand down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Preacher, why aren't you taking action?" Noah asked anxiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lead preacher barked sharply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then turned to Marcus, bowing deeply. "Groot greets you, Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other preachers exchanged glances and followed suit, their faces filled with respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What... what was going on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why had the preachers' attitudes changed so drastically?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many onlookers were stunned, thinking they must be hallucinating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had clearly hit Noah earlier, and logically, he should have been punished by the preachers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead, the preachers were showing Marcus the utmost respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who could make sense of this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah and his wife turned pale. He couldn't help but question the lead preacher, "Preacher, he's just an outsider. Surely you've mistaken him for someone else?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you insult Mr. Fitzgerald! Take him down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lead preacher gave the order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other preachers immediately restrained Noah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah's face twisted in indignation, and he roared angrily, "I did nothing wrong! Preacher, why are you arresting me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lead preacher let out a cold laugh. "Because of you, we almost wronged Mr. Fitzgerald. You offended him, and now you must pay the price!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, the lead preacher bowed again to Marcus. "Mr. Fitzgerald, how should we handle this man?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied casually, "This is an internal matter. I shouldn't interfere. You decide."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lead preacher nodded and turned to Noah. "You disrespected Mr. Fitzgerald. You're no longer fit to hold your position. You're fired, and all assets entrusted to you by the Godfather will be confiscated."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Noah was completely dumbfounded. The world spun around him, and he almost fainted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Audrey tried to argue but was slapped to the ground by a preacher. "Worthless woman! Even Mr. Fitzgerald doesn't interfere in our matters. Who are you to speak?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Audrey fell silent immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never imagined things would escalate to this point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before this, she had relied on her husband's status as the head of the preacher division to act with impunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had even bullied several kindergarten parents without reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her mind, her husband's position protected him from any consequences, no matter how outrageous his actions were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had grown accustomed to her arrogant and domineering lifestyle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But today, she had offended someone she never should have crossed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only had her husband's knees been shattered, but he was also fired, and all his assets were confiscated!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant they were now penniless&mdash;completely ruined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Preacher, I still don't know what I did wrong. Can you at least tell me so I can die understanding why?" Noah asked, his voice full of resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lead preacher stepped forward and whispered a few words into his ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah's eyes widened with sudden realization as he looked at Marcus. His gaze was now filled with terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never could have imagined that Marcus was the Godfather's son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had known, he wouldn't have dared to challenge Marcus, not even if he had a thousand lives to lose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now it was too late. What was done was done, and all he could do was swallow the bitter pill of regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah didn't dare reveal Marcus's identity. If he did, he knew his end would be even more brutal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the help of his wife, Noah stumbled away in humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd couldn't stop trembling. They had thought the arrival of the preachers signaled Marcus's end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead, these high-and-mighty preachers were bowing and scraping before Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah, who had been so powerful, was dismissed immediately for offending Marcus!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was impossible for them to fathom Marcus's true identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie was equally stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This experience hit her even harder than the time Marcus dealt with Walter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the preachers were deferential toward Marcus. Josie dared not think any further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reflecting on the many incredible things Marcus had shown her, Josie began to suspect he might have deep connections to the legendary Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus's remarkable status, the kindergarten principal turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She vaguely recalled something Marcus had told her earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, she had taken Noah and his wife's side without question, even helping them block Marcus and Josie from leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had done it all to curry favor with Noah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now it was clear&mdash;she had bet on the wrong side, and disastrously so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's status was far beyond anything Noah could ever match!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking this, the principal tried to sneak away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus stopped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you remember what I told you earlier?" Marcus asked.</span></p><div class="pagination">
