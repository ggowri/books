  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett froze, his face a mask of pure dread, body trembling like he'd seen a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd been teetering on the edge of a drug crash just moments ago, but the shock of it all&mdash;Stanley's fate, Callum's rage&mdash;wiped that itch clean out of his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right then, Callum's eyes flicked to him. He turned to Marcus, voice tight with deference. "Mr. Fitzgerald, what do we do with this one?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Callum knew damn well this whole mess started with Everett&mdash;he was the real loose end begging to be tied up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett's bravado collapsed like a cheap tent. He'd never imagined it'd come to this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, the drugs had him hooked deep, but he wasn't ready to check out. The thought of ending up like Stanley&mdash;limbs hacked off, dumped in the bay&mdash;shattered his last shred of nerve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His knees buckled, and he dropped before Marcus, mouth opening to beg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus just turned away, not sparing him a glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperate, Everett swung his plea to Chloe, his voice a pathetic whimper. "Chloe, help me out&mdash;talk to Mr. Fitzgerald. I was blind, running my mouth like an idiot, and didn't see who he was. I screwed up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're blood, Chloe&mdash;put in a word for me, please!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He started kowtowing, snot and tears smearing the pavement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe's heart wasn't built for this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yeah, Everett had pulled some awful stunts, but watching her brother grovel&mdash;she couldn't let him face Stanley's end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stepped up to Marcus, her voice soft but shaky. "Marcus, he gets it&mdash;he's sorry. Can you cut him some slack, for me? I know he's been a jerk, but he's my only brother. I can't just watch him die like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus finally turned back, sizing her up. "I let him off today, what's stopping him from hitting you up for cash tomorrow? You say no, he'll raise hell. You really think you can handle that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe bit her lip, speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't wrong. For years, Everett had bled her dry&mdash;every dime she scraped together from gigs went straight to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he'd only gotten worse, dragging her down when she should've been climbing in the entertainment scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, he was family. She couldn't let him go out like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She spun to Everett. "You want to live? Prove it. What's your plan&mdash;keep shooting up and mooching off me like before?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett wasn't too far gone to miss the lifeline Marcus was tossing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way&mdash;I'm done with that crap!" he blurted. "No more drugs, I swear. If Mr. Fitzgerald spares me, I'll check into rehab tomorrow&mdash;kick this for good, get a job, stand on my own. I won't bug you for a cent, ever again!" He slammed his forehead into the ground, bowing hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus faced him now, eyes locked on. "You said it. If I catch you using again&mdash;or shaking Chloe down&mdash;your end will make Stanley's look like a picnic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett lit up like he'd won the lottery. "Thank you, Mr. Fitzgerald! I'm done&mdash;I mean it. If I slip, you can do whatever you want to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He scrambled up, turning to Chloe with a flicker of guilt in his eyes. "I've been a mess, Chloe&mdash;drugs screwed me up, and I kept leaning on you. I was trash. I'm turning it around&mdash;wait until you see me clean."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could reply, he bolted, disappearing down the street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe watched him go, a spark of hope in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today would have actually cracked through his haze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he stuck to it&mdash;rehab, a fresh start&mdash;he could pull it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Marcus? He'd saved Everett from OD'ing into an early grave, spared her from getting drained dry until she had nothing left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd stopped the bleeding, giving them both a shot at something better. She owed him more than she could say&mdash;like he'd rebuilt their whole damn family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, if you're good, we'll head out," Callum said, glancing his way for approval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved him off. "I'll swing by Serpent's Coil in a few days&mdash;check your work. If it's not squared away, you're answering to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Callum's frame shook, but he nodded fast. "You got it, Mr. Fitzgerald&mdash;I'll deliver, no screw-ups!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go." Marcus flicked his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Callum bowed out, leading his Serpent's Coil crew away from Sunridge Estates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The storm Everett kicked up was finally over, and the apartment entrance was back into quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe's gaze lingered on Marcus, gratitude shining through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She opened her mouth to thank him, but he cut her off with a wave. "Don't. I told you I'd handle it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hesitated, then smirked a little. "Well... it's 10:00 p.m. now. Are we still doing that treatment?" Even in the dim light, her cheeks flushed pink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unless you want next month's cramps to hit like a truck," Marcus said with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her pulse quickened, a weird mix of nerves and anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hopped in the elevator, heading back to her place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus ducked into the bathroom to wash up, then strolled back into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, how's this work? What do I do?" Chloe asked, her voice tight despite herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lie flat on the bed. Best if you ditch the shirt and let me see your stomach," Marcus said, straight to the point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To fix her chills and those gyno issues, he'd use Timeless Numinous Energy to flush out the cold stuck in her system.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It pooled around her abdomen, so channeling the energy there worked best&mdash;no clothes in the way, or it would fizzle out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face went redder. "Gotta take it off?" she squeaked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd never stripped in front of a guy&mdash;ever. It felt awkward as hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, makes it easier. Clothes mess with the flow&mdash;won't hit right otherwise," he said, no hint of sleaze in his tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe chewed her lip, then tugged her tee over her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Left in just a white lace bra, her curves stood out&mdash;full, pale, with a deep line down the middle, bare to the air.</span></p><div class="pagination">
