  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of needing to unblock the second energy channel in two days made Grace's face flush with embarrassment, but she could not help feeling a sense of anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Benjamin, what are Grace and Marcus doing in her room?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the room, Lilian glanced at the closed door and asked Benjamin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grace wants to learn about martial arts. Mr. Fitzgerald is teaching her," Benjamin replied, reading documents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I passed by the door earlier and heard some strange noises. Are they really just learning martial arts?" Lilian asked skeptically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What strange noises?" Benjamin responded absentmindedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Do you remember what it was like when you were young, huh? Back then, you would drag me into the room, and my mom could not stop you. Now, you have all forgotten about it!" Lilian rolled her eyes and scolded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin raised an eyebrow, his face showing curiosity. "You really heard those kinds of noises?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why would I lie to you? Otherwise, why would I be asking? Letting them mess around in there could cause trouble!" Lilian said with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "After all, Grace is still a young woman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin did not get angry. Instead, his eyes lit up. "What trouble? If something happens, that is even better!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Benjamin, are you crazy? Grace is our daughter! Why would you say that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lilian was confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She is almost twenty. Do you not want her to have a good future?" Benjamin asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, who would not want their daughter to marry into a good family?" Lilian nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To me, Mr. Fitzgerald is the perfect choice for a son-in-law. If he really likes Grace, that would be the best thing!" Benjamin smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are right, but is it a bit early for them to be doing this? What if she gets pregnant?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lilian voiced her concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a woman, she was more focused on protecting Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If she gets pregnant, good! Then I will have a grandson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin chuckled, imagining holding his grandchild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that how you are thinking? But that would only make things harder for Grace."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lilian shot him a disapproving look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, Dad, what are you talking about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Grace and Marcus walked out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they had gotten dressed and freshened up, the flush on Grace's face was still visible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin and Lilian exchanged a knowing glance and smiled at each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lilian quickly said to Grace. "Nothing much, just chatting with your dad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace did not believe it. Benjamin and Lilian never whispered behind her back, and she clearly heard them talking quietly just now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Marcus left, Lilian pulled Grace into another room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With curiosity, Lilian asked, "Grace, tell me the truth, were you and Marcus doing something you should not have?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean, something I should not have? I do not understand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace looked at Lilian strangely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know, something between a man and a woman," Lilian continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace's face turned bright red, and the shy scene of Marcus unblocking her energy channel flashed through her mind again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, you are thinking too much. Mr. Fitzgerald was just helping me with my energy channel. We did not cross any lines."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You do not need to explain, I understand. I have been there. I heard it all, and I am not trying to stop you. I just want you to be careful, use protection, and do not get pregnant," Lilian advised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace felt so embarrassed. She could not understand why Lilian would think like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I really did not do anything with Mr. Fitzgerald. You are misunderstanding..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace was not sure how to explain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grace, you are almost twenty. I will not stop you from doing anything. As long as you are happy, it is fine. Mr. Fitzgerald saved your life, and he is a good man&mdash;capable and educated. Your dad and I both support you. If you want to be with him, go ahead. We will not interfere."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lilian said with a smile and left the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace sat on her bed, staring at her reflection in the mirror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was still hot, and once again, Marcus' image appeared in her mind, along with the thrilling scene, which made her body react in ways she did not expect.</span></p><div class="pagination">
