Boohoo!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the thought that she made Nick miss the best time for treatment, which caused his imminent death, Lisa couldn't hold back the tears of grief, and she fell into endless self-reproach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Allan didn't say anything, but he thought he had something to do with this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he knew a better doctor, Nick might have been fine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On top of that, Allan regretted that he shouldn't have taken Marcus lightly, or it would have ended up differently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Lisa, take it easy. I said that our hospital had nothing to help, but it didn't mean that Mr. Fitzgerald would do nothing because I didn't know that Mr. Fitzgerald was here before I said that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cary hurriedly explained it just as Lisa finished speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew of Marcus' fabulous medical skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That not only convinced Charles, but even Robert, the professor in Solariae, had nothing but praise for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This showed that Marcus' medical skills were not only limited to treating cancer, but he could also perform surgical operations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In that case, Marcus could have no problem treating cerebral infarction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as he finished speaking, Aria, Lisa and Allan looked at Marcus with incredulous eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aria and Lisa were even thinking about what Marcus had just said back at Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was then that Marcus seemed to have said that he could treat cerebral infarction, but they didn't believe it at all, which was why they came to this hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus, please, save my dad. Mr. Grant said you can cure my dad, so please!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking about this, Lisa couldn't worry about her self-respect anymore and fell right down in front of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus stepped forward and helped Lisa up. "Lisa, don't say that. We're all family, and I'm sure I won't stand by and do nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Saying that, he greeted Cary, "Mr. Grant, please get me a treatment room for me, and I just need a bed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No problem. I'll arrange it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cary agreed with him quickly. With that, he told the nurse beside him to arrange a hospital bed for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They worked together to carry Nick, who was completely unconscious, to the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus entered the treatment room and closed the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, he used his X-ray vision to view Nick's condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He found that Nick's blood vessels in his brain were completely blocked at this moment, preventing normal blood circulation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The loss of blood supply to his brain was what caused Nick to go into extreme shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Nick didn't get his veins dredged, he would soon be in heaven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without much time to think, Marcus directly applied the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire. As the Timeless Numinous Energy surged in his palm, it rapidly passed into Nick's body along the palm of his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The energy ran quickly down Nick's veins towards the brain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Besides, it accurately found the blocked blood vessels in Nick's brain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under the effect of the formidable Numinous Energy, Nick's blood vessels that had been clogged were quickly dredged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the restoration of blood circulation, Nick's heartbeat returned, and his face gradually returned to normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During the entire process, Nick's cerebral infarction was cured in less than five minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't stop delivering the Timeless Numinous Energy, and he used it to completely dredge the blood vessels in Nick's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick, who was in his fifties, had as much energy in his veins as a child of five or six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was cured of his old cardiovascular problems altogether.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Nick's breathing was even, and he looked normal. Although he didn't wake up yet, he was completely out of danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Marcus walked out of the hospital room, Lisa, Allan, Aria, Richard, and Melinda immediately gathered around him to ask about the treatment.</span></p><div class="pagination">
