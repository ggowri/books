  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pete's gaze swept over Maxine, lingering briefly. When he saw how attractive she was, a flash of greed flickered in his eyes before disappearing and asking, "Miss, what's your relationship with him? Why so nervous when I mention him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine froze, unsure how to respond. Pete smirked smugly, shifting his attention to Marcus. "Before, you were messing around with my ex. Now you've latched onto this cop? Didn't expect you to have such tricks up your sleeve."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as those words left his mouth, everyone present cast Marcus a strange look, especially Maxine. For a brief moment, an inexplicable pang of jealousy stirred in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Pete pushed things further, Brenden's patience wore thin. "I've already made it clear&mdash;Marcus is an honored guest of ours. Mr. Hudson, please show some respect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pete crossed one leg over the other, his face full of arrogance. As a direct descendant of Eldoria's esteemed Hudson family, his status was unmatched. In the small city of Solomia, no matter how arrogant he was, who would dare challenge him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring Brenden completely, Pete continued, "We in Eldoria value experts. We don't waste time bickering. You </span><span>Uswad</span><span> people are always chasing respect, but respect comes from strength." He glanced at Solomia's mayor, Benjamin Mitchell, and added, "Don't you agree, Mayor Benjamin?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin, though equally irritated by Pete's arrogance, maintained a faint smile. "You're right, Mr. Hudson. Everything should indeed be decided by strength."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tension between </span><span>Uswad</span><span> and Eldoria was palpable even before the fighting competition began. Although representatives from the other four nations didn't intervene, they eagerly anticipated the upcoming showdown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The matches started soon after, beginning with the women's division. Using the wrestling techniques Marcus had taught her, Maxine defeated opponent after opponent, even taking down Eldoria's female fighter in the finals to claim the women's championship in the multinational invitational.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine had only hoped to rank in the top ten and had never dreamed of winning the championship. She was overjoyed and deeply grateful for Marcus' guidance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine couldn't believe how such seemingly simple wrestling moves could unleash such incredible power in practice. After all, her opponent in the finals was a top-three finisher in the international martial arts competition, yet that very powerhouse couldn't withstand a single throw from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The audience erupted into thunderous applause, and for a moment, Maxine basked in the spotlight. The only exception was Edward, whose expression darkened. He knew all too well whose techniques Maxine had used.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin turned to Pete and said, "Mr. Hudson, humility is a virtue of ours in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>. We don't just admire experts&mdash;we strive to become them. As you said earlier, it all comes down to strength."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pete's face darkened. He hadn't expected Maxine to be so skilled. However, he didn't seem too concerned, as the women's division drew less attention. The main event was still the men's division. He believed that as long as Eldoria won the men's championship, it would silence these </span><span>Uswad</span><span> people completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Pete made a last-minute decision to replace one of their male competitors with Gibson, the fighter standing behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, the men's division began. Edward and Eldoria's Gibson dominated their opponents, advancing to face each other in the finals. Gibson, in particular, was ruthless&mdash;none of his opponents lasted more than three moves, and all of them left the ring with serious injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the finals started, Pete stepped down from the podium and whispered to Gibson, "Take that </span><span>Uswad</span><span> guy out. You'll be well rewarded."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A greedy glint flashed in Gibson's eyes as he nodded in agreement. Although the two were speaking in hushed tones, their conversation didn't escape Marcus' sharp ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, with his X-ray vision, Marcus saw that Gibson wasn't entirely human&mdash;he was a cyborg with mechanical implants. Such a competitor was far beyond what ordinary fighters could handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, Gibson had been holding back in the earlier matches, yet he had effortlessly made it to the finals. This was highly unfair in a tournament meant for human participants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back at the podium, Pete smirked smugly and said, "Mayor Benjamin, your </span><span>Uswad</span><span> fighter is strong, but I bet he won't last three moves against Gibson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with his usually good temper, Benjamin struggled to endure Pete's relentless provocation. "Our </span><span>Uswad</span><span> fighter is a former national martial arts champion. Mr. Hudson, aren't you being a bit too arrogant?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
