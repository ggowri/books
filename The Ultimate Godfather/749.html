Marcus wondered to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instinctively, he swam toward the source of the energy waves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he descended more profoundly, the water grew darker until he could barely navigate without his spiritual powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The increasing water pressure at these depths began taking its toll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even his Aqua Sphere's protective barrier started showing cracks, threatening to collapse at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus quickly channeled his Timeless Numinous Energy to reinforce the barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did the protective shield stabilize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued his descent until he reached 3,000 meters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this depth, no natural light penetrated the darkness.
