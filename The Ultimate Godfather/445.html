        <h1>Chapter 444 Scared?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You monster! Guess I was wrong all these years, thinking of you as my real sister."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tracy gritted her teeth, her gaze shifting to Tristan, and she pleaded, "Tristan, what are we going to do? Please, think of something!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tristan's face darkened. Riley was the most influential person he knew, but even he couldn't help him now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What was worse, he was treating Marcus with all due respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Tristan still had one last card to play&mdash;his parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His parents were executives at Eastcomm Group, and he was certain they'd find a way out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that thought, Tristan threw Marcus a defiant look and said, "Brat, don't think just because you know people in the Ganston SWAT team, you're all that. My parents are high-level execs at Eastcomm Group. I'll call them right now, get them to call the big shots in Kingston, and order the SWAT team to release us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, Tristan pulled out his phone and started dialing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your parents are executives at Eastcomm Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow, slightly intrigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't quite figure out why he kept running into people from his company everywhere he went.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Was it because his empire was just that vast? Maybe...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's wrong, scared?" Tristan continued with a mocking smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Eastcomm Group is the leading company in Kingston's emerging industries, and they're famous nationwide. My parents know a lot of influential people. Dealing with some Solomia guy like you will be a piece of cake! If you're scared, tell them to release us right now and apologize to me. Maybe I'll let you off the hook. Otherwise, get ready for my wrath!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tristan sneered, thinking Marcus was intimidated by the mention of his parents. He was sure that Marcus was about to back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' voice sounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You believe me or not, one phone call and I can have your parents fired."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tristan scoffed, and the Dowson family laughed too, their gazes filled with mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tracy scoffed, "You think you can make things happen just because you know a few SWAT officers? You probably haven't even heard of Eastcomm Group. Getting them fired? That's laughable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tracy, stop wasting time with him. I'm dying to see how one phone call can get Tristan's parents fired," Lucas chimed in, his voice laced with sarcasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go ahead and make that call. You have five minutes. If it doesn't work, you'll regret it!" Tristan shot back, his voice dripping with challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"One minute will do," Marcus said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without another word, he dialed the president of Eastcomm Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as the president heard Marcus' name, he became extremely polite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus immediately located a couple named Harrold, two managers in the company, and ordered the president to fire them both.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The president immediately set the wheels in motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hanging up, Marcus was met with Tristan's mocking voice once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well, I've got to give it to you. You play the role well. You really think you're some big shot who knows the president of Eastcomm Group? I even suspect that your connections with these SWAT officers are just part of the act!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Tristan finished his taunt, his phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was his father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tristan quickly answered the call, only to hear his father's dejected voice. "Tristan, your mom and I just got fired. You have to keep the BioFusion Pharmaceuticals deal going. This is our last chance at income!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tristan's world shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His hands trembled, and he stammered, "Dad, what... what did you say? I didn't catch that. Say it again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His father repeated what he'd just said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In that instant, Tristan felt his world spinning. He almost collapsed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tristan, what's going on? What happened?" Tracy asked, worry lining her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My... my parents... they've been fired!" Tristan said, his voice full of despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The room fell silent, all eyes wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one had expected Marcus to be right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One phone call, not even a minute, and Tristan's parents were out of a job.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How could this be? How was it possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tristan's parents were high-level executives at Eastcomm Group, earning millions of dollars a year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How could they be fired so easily just because of one phone call?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The entire Dowson family was shocked, their gazes turning toward Marcus with newfound respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Miles and Riley, who had been watching from a distance, exchanged a look of surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Until now, they'd thought Marcus was just an unstoppable force in battle&mdash;he'd single-handedly wiped out the Black Hawk Legion's cyborgs and earned his legendary status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, they were seeing that his connections were just as powerful.</span></p></div>
