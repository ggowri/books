        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling the faint orchid fragrance on his face, Marcus couldn't help but laugh, "Sure, you can thank me, but you have to do it another way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only Melina could understand what he was implying, and then she blushed with her head down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although the bidding meeting was full of twists and turns, the result turned out great.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Marcus' powerful support, Golden Group won the bid in the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the contract was generated that night, and the business was transferred to the Flourish Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melina laughed after receiving the message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The top members of her family had great hopes for her on this bidding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she knew that the competition was too fierce and that the Flourish Group had no advantage in the face of large companies across provinces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It could even be said that the opportunity was very slim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It never occurred to her that she could win the bid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And all this was thanks to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made Melina grateful to Marcus and she also admired him a lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then Marcus left the bidding meeting with Melina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They drove the Ferrari 720s into the charming night of the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Melina, where are we going?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Didn't you say to go to the hotel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melina was looking for something in her bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't realize until she finished speaking that she had broken her word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your words, not mine," Marcus smiled. He had been waiting for her to say this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't-" Melina wanted to explain but didn't know what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, Marcus took her to the nearest Ritz-Carlton Hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was the first time that Melina had come to a hotel with a man. Although she had slept with Marcus already, she was still a little nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as they entered the room, Marcus hugged her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I need to take a shower first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melina blushed and didn't know why she was nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then hurry up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus let Melina go, sat on the sofa, and lit a cigarette.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melina picked up her bag and trotted into the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Why did she take her bag into the shower?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't get it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a long while, the bathroom door was pushed open again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melina didn't cover herself with a towel like Marcus imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She even put on a black lace lingerie!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This fabric was very thin, and Melina's attractive, charming body was looming, which gave Marcus a strong visual impact!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melina's long hair was damp and the fragrance of orchids on her body was more and more rich.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the black lace lingerie, her skin looked more delicate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her plump breasts were completely shown in front of Marcus!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Through the lace, her breasts were also faintly visible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Below that, it was her flat belly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The lace skirt under her lower abdomen was very short.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From his angle, he could even see the forbidden zone between her legs and the mysterious gap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her long legs seemed so flawless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was like a perfect handicraft!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had done it twice in the narrow Ferrari car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not only was the space small, but the light was also dime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus couldn't see Melina's beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now Melina put on sexy underwear. She instantly became a sexy goddess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only Diana's figure could compare with Melina's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was of Weston Land descent, while Melina was the beauty of Oriana Land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The beauty of the two women was completely different, but they could all attract Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Am I pretty?" Melina asked Marcus shyly in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes," Marcus subconsciously answered, then put out the cigarette and asked, "Why did you change into this kind of clothes? Where did you get it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't you like it?" Melina asked. She was afraid he didn't like it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I like it. I am just a little curious," Marcus said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I bought it from the Internet and I don't know if you like its style." Melina bit her lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her shyness made people feel pity for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is exactly what I like!" Marcus laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I was afraid you wouldn't like me anymore after we slept together. So I used this to please you." Melina continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sexy lingerie was every man's thing. She learned that from the Internet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So she wanted to give it a try.</span></p></div>
