  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment Marcus spoke, Johnathan raised an eyebrow, a look of disdain curling at the corner of his lips. "I don't understand," he sneered. "What has made you so arrogant? Is it because you defeated my disciple?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus calmly replied, "In my eyes, he's not even worth the dirt on my boots. Beating him isn't something to boast about."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Arrogant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Johnathan's fury flared up, and he immediately gathered his ninja energy, swinging a deadly knife-hand strike toward Marcus' throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unlike the typical attacks of ordinary fighters, this strike was infused with the essence of a ninja's energy, making it far more powerful than what an average person could withstand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Marcus had been just another skilled fighter, he would have surely taken damage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Marcus didn't flinch. He casually reached out and seized Johnathan's knife-hand mid-air, stopping it effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Johnathan's brows furrowed in surprise. He hadn't expected Marcus to react so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And in that brief moment, he also sensed something unusual about Marcus&mdash;a rare and distinct energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only then did he realize that this young man might very well be one of the Ancient Martial Arts practitioners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Still, Johnathan didn't care much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He reasoned that someone of Marcus' age, even if he was a practitioner, likely wouldn't have mastered the martial art to any great extent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a seasoned ninja, he had longed for an opportunity to face off against an Ancient Martial Artist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that thought in mind, he drew upon his ninja energy once more and launched a series of attacks from another angle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus, however, easily parried the strikes, his movements fluid and precise. This only fueled Johnathan's anger, and with a ferocious roar, he summoned all his power for an even more forceful knife-hand strike aimed squarely at Marcus' head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You done yet? It's time this ends," Marcus said, his patience running thin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He delivered a single punch with effortless speed and precision, directly striking Johnathan's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The impact was thunderous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Johnathan let out a scream, his body flung backward as if struck by a freight train.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He crashed into the edge of the ring with a bone-rattling thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The surrounding barriers, designed to withstand heavy impacts, bounced him back with great force. Gritting his teeth against the pain, Johnathan's gaze hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fueled by his rage, he tried to use the rebound to launch another punch at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This punch was not just fast but also packed with the full might of his ninja power. It was a strike that aimed to crush Marcus where he stood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus, however, didn't even flinch. With a nonchalant movement, he swung a backhanded punch that landed squarely on the side of Johnathan's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The impact was brutal, and Johnathan collapsed to the ground at Marcus' feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus stepped casually on Johnathan's chest and looked down at him with cold amusement. "I didn't want to waste time with you, but you kept pushing. I really don't understand why you're so eager to die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without waiting for a response, Marcus turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The words were simple, but they dripped with disdain and insult, leaving Johnathan seething with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Marcus could even step off the ring, Johnathan, in a blind fit of fury, pulled a ninja blade from his waist and lunged at Marcus from behind, intending to strike him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Watch out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shannon's voice rang out from the crowd, her face now twisted in concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd erupted in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one had expected Johnathan, having clearly lost the fight, to resort to such a cowardly, underhanded attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His ninja blade was razor-sharp, and if it struck Marcus, the consequences could be dire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus' reflexes were lightning-fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment he sensed the threat, he effortlessly sidestepped, evading the deadly strike. In a single motion, he seized Johnathan by the throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a cold, almost bored tone, Marcus spoke, "I didn't want to stoop to your level, but you insisted on trying to kill me. If that's what you want, then I'll end it here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Johnathan could even muster a plea for mercy, Marcus twisted his grip with a sickening crunch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Crack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sound of breaking bone echoed through the arena as Johnathan's throat snapped, his body going limp and collapsing to the floor, lifeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd was stunned into silence. What was supposed to be a mere sparring match had escalated into something no one could have anticipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Johnathan's relentless pursuit of vengeance had cost him his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Johnathan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Easton's voice cracked with rage as he rushed forward, trying to lift Johnathan's lifeless body. But it was too late. His disciple was gone, the life drained from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Easton glared at Marcus, his fury evident. "It was just a sparring match! Why did you kill him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus sneered, his voice dripping with sarcasm. "He tried to ambush me from behind. Are you saying I shouldn't defend myself? Is that your sense of honor?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words struck a chord with the audience, and the crowd's support immediately shifted in his favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though Marcus had killed Johnathan, everyone could see that it had been an act of self-defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many spectators had even recorded the entire fight on their phones, ensuring that the truth would be undeniable, even if the authorities got involved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Easton's teeth ground together, his rage reaching a boiling point.</span></p><div class="pagination">
