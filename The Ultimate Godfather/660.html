  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Jenson, who had suffered one devastating blow after another, completely broke down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pointing his finger at Marcus and Chad, he shouted angrily, "Today, I'm going to kill both of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had lost his career and his money, and even his wife had started thinking about betraying him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What did he have to fear anymore?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he was going down, they could all go down together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Jenson continued to act arrogantly, Marcus didn't hold back. He kicked Jenson hard in the stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson screamed in pain, collapsing to the ground and groaning in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone present was stunned. Nobody expected Marcus, who used to be meek and quiet in school, to fight so fiercely now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in school, Jenson was tall and muscular, and few dared to provoke him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, in front of Marcus, he was completely overpowered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, you son of a..." Jenson's eyes burned with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clutched his stomach and tried to get up, but Marcus kicked him in the chest again, sending him sprawling back to the ground. "Who gave you the nerve to speak to me like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't believe how dominant Marcus had become. He remembered beating Marcus up several times back in school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, Marcus wouldn't even dare to fight back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, I admit I can't beat you now. But you'd better watch out. I'll call someone to deal with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, the crowd exchanged uneasy glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew Jenson was planning to go all out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some who knew Jenson well were aware that he had connections with both Sync Group in Kingston and some underground figures in Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in school, Jenson often hung out with those types.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them was a guy named Bob.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Jenson was in high school, Bob was just a low-level thug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he had risen to become a leader in Serpent's Coil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Jenson still had ties with Bob and called him over, even Marcus' wealth wouldn't protect him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason was simple: Serpent's Coil was notorious as the largest gang in Solomia, ruling over the city's entire underworld.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its members were ruthless and known for their brutal killings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, there was no known connection between Serpent's Coil and Sync Group in Kingston, which meant Marcus couldn't rely on any external influence to help him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, Jenson pulled out his phone and called Bob.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, Bob, how have you been? I'm back in Solomia and ran into some trouble. Can you come and help me out?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're at Private Room 603 of the Golden Hotel. Bring a few men with you. This guy can fight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After giving the instructions, Jenson hung up, leaving everyone in the room tense. They had guessed correctly. Jenson had indeed called Bob from Serpent's Coil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bob from Serpent's Coil is coming. Looks like Marcus is in deep trouble now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, Serpent's Coil has been extremely active in Solomia's underworld lately. I heard they've taken over more than ninety percent of the city's gangs. And Bob is now one of their leaders. He's incredibly powerful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus really stepped on a landmine today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The murmurs among the crowd were filled with worry for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, Jenson's calling someone from the underworld. Should I call the police?" Chad asked, his concern evident. As a native of Solomia, Chad knew how dangerous Serpent's Coil could be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hah, do you think the police wouldn't be taken care of before Serpent's Coil acts? You're so naive. No wonder you used to deliver takeout!" Jenson sneered, his face full of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "As long as I could take down Marcus and Chad today, I don't mind going to jail for it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Chad. They can't touch me," Marcus said calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson laughed coldly, "Marcus, I'll admit you're impressive, richer, and stronger than me. But no amount of money can stop a gang's blade. I'll have you torn to pieces today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so? Then I'd like to see if your so-called blades can do anything to me," Marcus replied, his face still full of confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than five minutes, the door to the private room burst open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bob entered with a group of men from Serpent's Coil, each armed and wearing menacing expressions. They all held weapons and had ferocious looks on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of them sent many of the classmates into a panic. Several of the women shrieked and huddled in the corners, trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bob, you're finally here. I'm so sorry to trouble you this late!" Jenson hurried forward, his face full of deference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in high school, Jenson had run with Bob's crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bob was quite satisfied with Jenson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was ruthless and often brought high school girls to Bob for entertainment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was one of the main reasons Bob had agreed to show up tonight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who hit you?" Bob asked Jenson.</span></p><div class="pagination">
