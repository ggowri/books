  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Josie left, Marcus retrieved Johnson's Spatial Ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a drop of blood, he performed the ritual to bind the ring to himself, making it his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immersing his consciousness into the Spatial Ring, Marcus meticulously examined its contents, transferring everything of value to his own Spatial Ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among Johnson's belongings were millions of dollars in cash and several enchanted gemstones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to magical tomes, enchanted gemstones contained latent magical energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By reciting specific incantations, one could unleash this energy in battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the stones were single-use, discharging their power in one burst before becoming useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As such, they were often reserved for life-threatening situations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During his fight with Johnson, Marcus had been too swift for him to activate these stones, ultimately claiming them for himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Spatial Ring also contained two spell manuals: Fireball and Lightning&mdash;abilities Marcus had seen Johnson use.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was ecstatic. Up until now, his magical tomes were merely introductory guides for novice wizards, lacking any advanced spells.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these manuals, he could finally begin learning and mastering the powerful techniques of Fireball and Lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the items, a tattered, yellowed booklet caught Marcus's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flipping through it, he realized it was Johnson's personal journal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entries revealed Johnson's affiliation with a Weston Magic Guild, where he had worked as a freelance wizard&mdash;essentially a mercenary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the guild's network, he had been hired by the Brown family in Kingston for long-term service.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides fulfilling his obligations to the Browns, the journal mentioned two names that struck a chord with Marcus: his estranged brothers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It became clear that both his brothers had dealings with the Weston Magic Guild, with the second brother even hiring Johnson on occasion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus encountered more people and delved deeper into the world, he began piecing together fragments of his brothers' lives, learning more about their connections and motives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He put the items away and began practicing the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After an intense night of training, enhanced by rare magical herbs, Marcus successfully elevated his cultivation to the second peak of Ancient Martial Stage Two, significantly increasing his combat prowess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, Marcus hailed a cab and returned to BioFusion Pharmaceuticals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed Josie had been waiting for him at the entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment she saw Marcus's striking figure appear in her line of sight, her face lit up with a radiant smile. She hurried to greet him. "Good morning, Mr. Fitzgerald!" she said warmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded in acknowledgment. Guided by Josie, he toured the BioFusion Pharmaceuticals' production line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The facility was entirely modernized, featuring cutting-edge equipment and highly trained staff, meeting the highest international standards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus found it hard to believe that Josie had achieved all this in just five years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He made a mental note to seek her advice on business management.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the tour, Marcus finalized the details for his order of ten production lines. The two of them then returned to Josie's office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to Marcus's treatment the previous day, Josie looked radiant, with no sign of her prior ailments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the contrary, she appeared invigorated, exuding a newfound femininity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Shelman, the representatives from AquaVital Pharmaceuticals in Kingston are here. They're insisting on meeting you," Josie's secretary said as she knocked and entered the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Josie replied, "Tell them I'm hosting an esteemed guest. They'll have to wait a moment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl nodded and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You certainly are busy, Ms. Shelman," Marcus remarked. In just the two days he'd been here, BioFusion Pharmaceuticals had been bustling with visitors eager to negotiate deals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Josie could respond, a rough voice echoed from the corridor. "I don't care! I want to see Ms. Shelman now! If she doesn't come out, I'll barge into her office myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Wollaston," the secretary pleaded, "Ms. Shelman is meeting with a guest. Please wait in the reception room for just a moment!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
