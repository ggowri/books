        <h1>Chapter 591 Logistics Company</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana felt as if she were flying among the clouds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was wrapped in huge waves of happiness and couldn't bear it at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Marcus moving in and out violently, he finally exploded totally at some point, instantly filling her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana lay back against the seat, a wave of unprecedented satisfaction washing over her, gasping for breath heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a few moments, Diana forced herself to awaken with a sense of weakness. "Mr. Fitzgerald, you are so mean. You didn't even ask for my permission to bring me here to do this kind of shameful thing. You're so awful..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes were filled with flirtation as her body was blushing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was extremely gentle, giving Marcus a strong sense of temptation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dual cultivation, you know, can improve your power. I'm genuinely looking out for you," Marcus said with a smile. Looking at Diana's perfect body, he seemed unable to resist his desire again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not doing me any favors at all. You know best what's going on in your mind, and I'm ignoring you from now on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glared at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled, "You can ignore me, but don't do something wrong in private. That </span><span>would be even more humiliating!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Diana's face turned even more flushed. She glared at Marcus and said, "Mr. Fitzgerald, stop it. How can you be so mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Diana even wanted to find a place to hide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave Diana a kiss on her pretty face and started the car towards Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a barren mountain somewhere outside </span><span>Solomia</span><span>, Alison was walking through the inside of a dense forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Diana didn't come after her, she stopped and panted heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Alison just couldn't hold back from spitting out another mouthful of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana is such a bitch. She became a Level Nine Demon Fighter realm so soon, and she must have a secret inside. I have to find it out, and I'm going to grab the secret of her rapid breakthrough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alison said through her gritted teeth, her blue eyes showing fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Return to </span><span>Bayside Villa</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus returned to Bayside Villa and learned about the state above the Foundation Establishment stage, he practiced even more diligently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't even have dinner and devoted himself to the state of cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the help of a lot of pills and the favor generated from the Dual Cultivation with Diana just now, he finally broke through the power to the peak level of Ancient Martial Stage Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, his magic level also reached the peak of a Level Five Wizard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made his battle power take another qualitative leap, and he became even more formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had made a call to Darian last night while he was practicing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked Darian about the progress of organizing the logistics company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Darian's rapid implementation, the location of the logistics company was chosen on the site of a former machinery factory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the machinery factory had been closed for years, and a lot of the houses were in a state of disrepair, the logistics company didn't require a lot of the decoration of the house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as it could be used to store goods, and the cars could be parked in and out of it, there was no problem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The workshops of this machinery factory were just right for warehousing, and it was pretty spacious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darian bought the machinery factory for two hundred million dollars to be used as a site for the logistics company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The logistics company started hiring employees after completing a number of formalities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darian had experience working at the bottom of a logistics system, and he knew the salary offers of most of the logistics companies in the market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took him only one day to develop a reasonable salary system.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Darian recruited hundreds of new graduates from </span><span>Solomia</span><span> University as </span><span>well as from several leading colleges in </span><span>Solomia</span><span> to join the essential management of the logistics company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Darian hired an experienced manager from a well-known logistics company in </span><span>Solomia</span><span> as the initial manager of the logistics company at a high salary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once everything was ready, Darian's logistics company was open for business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to good service standards and a reasonable pricing range, the logistics company became popular with many customers as soon as it started its business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their orders had increased dramatically, and the entire logistics company seemed to be on the right track as soon as they opened it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the day that the logistics company was open for business tomorrow, and Marcus was ready to visit it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, Marcus had breakfast before driving to Darian's logistics company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had just arrived at the entrance of the logistics company when a burst of noise attracted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Darian, don't you look in the mirror? You're just a truck driver, but you also want to organize a logistics company, huh? You are unbelievable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me tell you, with our Rising Logistics Company around, you can't run your company!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An extremely arrogant voice came over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus parked his car on the side of the road and walked through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He saw hundreds of people in logistics overalls with weapons in hand, surrounding Darian, Ramona, Kiera, and the newly hired senior figures of the logistics company.</span></p></div>
