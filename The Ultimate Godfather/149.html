  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't ask for the reason behind her plea for help; instead, he turned the car around and pressed down on the accelerator. With the engine roaring invitingly, the car sped off in another direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just three minutes, Marcus's car came to a stop at the intersection of Fifth Avenue and Sixth Avenue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a distance, he spotted Michelle's figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing opposite Michelle was a tall, blonde-haired, blue-eyed young man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This young man, named Pete Hudson, was handsome and dashing, dressed in a well-tailored suit that exuded an air of gentlemanliness, embodying the typical look of someone from Weston Land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle turned to leave, but Pete blocked her way, babbling incessantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle's face was filled with disgust, but due to Pete's superior strength, she couldn't break free at the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I told you, we're over. What do you want by harassing me?" Michelle shouted at Pete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pete shrugged and said, "I admit I was wrong about what happened before. Can't you forgive me just this once for the sake of our past relationship? And I came all the way to Uswad to find you; can't you show me any consideration?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle's eyes were red-rimmed as she said, "Have you forgotten the promises you made to me? Do you really think a flimsy apology will earn my forgiveness? Just stay with Luna and don't bother me anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Michelle was unmoved by his words, Pete lost some of his patience and laughed, "I get it, you must have someone else now, right? You've forgotten about me. Fine, you always pretended to be so conservative when we were in school, refusing to sleep with me. I finally see your dirty nature!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle could no longer hold back her tears and cried, "You cheated first, and you have the nerve to say such things to me? You're right, I do have a boyfriend. I just called him, and he should be here any minute!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pete sneered. "I did cheat on you with Luna, but I've already apologized. Besides, given the Hudson family's status in Eldoria, having four or five lovers is quite normal. Why can't you accept it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll see what kind of man you've found. Not to mention this small Solomia, there isn't a force in the entire Uswad that can compare to the Hudson family!" he said arrogantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He came from the Hudson family in Eldoria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Hudson family had marital ties with the royal family of Eldoria, making them one of the top-tier families in all of Territorialia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Pete grew up with an arrogant personality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was accustomed to being adored wherever he went and only knew how to bully others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He and Michelle were classmates at Briarwood University, where they once had feelings for each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But because Michelle was conservative, she never engaged in intimate relations with Pete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pete then cheated on her with his classmate Luna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon learning about this, Michelle confronted Luna and the two even got into a physical fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Pete was partial to Luna and slapped Michelle. Michelle resolutely ended her relationship with Pete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle still remembered this incident to this day. After returning to her home country, she had thrown herself into her career, and the wounds inflicted by Pete had gradually faded with time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never thought that this bastard would suddenly appear in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Pete's arrogant face, Michelle felt nothing but disgust and said coldly, "My boyfriend is not only handsome but also responsible. Most importantly, he has a conscience, which you completely lack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While saying these words, Michelle's mind was filled with the image of Marcus's handsome figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bitch, you've become so unbearable over these years. I came to see you out of kindness, and you dare to insult me like this? I must teach you a lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle's words enraged Pete, and he raised his hand as if to slap her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such actions and scenes were all too familiar to Michelle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few years ago at Briarwood University, Pete hit her in just this way to help Luna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle even developed a psychological shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her fear, she trembled uncontrollably, closing her eyes tightly, bracing for his slap to land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, at that moment, a tall and handsome man stepped forward to protect Michelle, grabbed Pete's wrist, and forcefully threw it off!</span></p><div class="pagination">
