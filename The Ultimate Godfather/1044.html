        <h1>Chapter 946 Most Entertainment Stars-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The house in Sunridge Estates only cost three million dollars, and it's the smallest unit in the entire neighborhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, from Chloe's words, it seems that this three million dollars is still on a loan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>May</span><span> I ask</span><span> </span><span>what's your current appearance fee?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe replied calmly, "Last year, it was about one million dollars. This year, after that song </span><span>became a huge hit</span><span>, it went up to five million dollars, but I only took home around one million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The remaining four million dollars, after taxes, has to be handed over to Royal Entertainment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow and continued, "That one million dollars doesn't even account for the expenses of your agent, makeup artist, assistants, and so on, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe nodded firmly, saying, "Exactly. So, entertainment stars aren't as rich as people think unless you can start your own film company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, after all the deductions from a performance, not much is left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, we spend a lot of time maintaining our image. For example, the cosmetics we use, the supplements we take, the gym memberships, and the clothing</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>A</span><span>ll of these </span><span>add up</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So right now, I don't have much money left. I even have to pay over ten thousand dollars a month in mortgage."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had a general understanding of Chloe's situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, ever since he last met with Lila, he had gained some insight into the lives of most entertainment stars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless they're among the biggest names in the industry, who have already </span><span>established themselves</span><span>, most entertainers live pretty modest lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were many people who had shot to fame and then disappeared just as quickly, only to be forgotten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without strong subsequent work to support them, they ended up struggling in life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Chloe's Midnight Serenade had become a huge hit this year, allowing her to secure her position in the cutthroat entertainment industry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they arrived back at Chloe's house in Sunridge Estates, Marcus was preparing to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a man in his thirties approached from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was thin and walked unsteadily, with his eyes wandering aimlessly, giving off a dazed impression as if he lacked energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that</span><span> the man walk</span><span>ed</span><span> towards them, Chloe's face immediately turned a little darker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly looked down and tried to enter the building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could enter, the man called out to her, "Chloe, where are you going? Don't tell me you didn't see me. Why do you avoid me when you see me? You've changed, girl. Didn't you always want to hang out with me when you were younger? What happened to that now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, the man had already reached the door of the building and began banging loudly on the glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe had no choice but to walk out of the building, saying, "I helped you find a job not long ago. Why are you coming to me again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man, looking impatient, said, "That job only paid seven to eight thousand a month, and it was exhausting. I barely had time to rest. Do I look like someone who can handle such hard work?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're a big star now. You make so much money every day. Now that you have money, you can't forget me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe responded, "There's no </span><span>job</span><span> that isn't tiring. The job </span><span>needed you to work</span><span> 8 hours a day, and </span><span>paid </span><span>seven to eight thousand a month</span><span>. It</span><span> was already quite good. At least it's enough for your own living expenses. I even helped you get it</span><span> through some connections</span><span>. Why did you quit just like that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I may be a celebrity, but you know how much money I </span><span>really </span><span>have. I</span><span> just</span><span> made some money this year. Not long ago, I managed to save up half a million dollars, planning to pay off my mortgage, but you took it all. How am I supposed to have any money left?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man looked Chloe up and down, tugging at the edge of her clothes as he said, "You </span><span>tell me</span><span> you have no money? The clothes you're wearing alone must cost at least t</span><span>hree</span><span> thousand dollars. You're telling me you're broke? Are you trying to fool me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could you wear afford such expensive outfit if you have no money? Once people get rich, they forget where they came from. I used to care about you so much when you were young, and it feels like it was all for nothing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe rolled her eyes in frustration and replied, "I went to an awards ceremony today. Don't you think I should dress up a bit? This outfit is from two years ago! Every year, I rely on it for important events. I only have two nice outfits, and you've already seen both."</span></p></div>
