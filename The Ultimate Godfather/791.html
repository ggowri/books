        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From his Spatial Ring, he pulled out a small, intricately carved amulet and handed it to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada's eyes shimmered, a mix of emotions crossing her features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hesitated, but then reached out to take the amulet. "I'll see you again, Marcus," she said, her voice steady, though her expression held a quiet complexity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Goodbye, then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded once, and without another word, turned and walked away, disappearing into the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she watched </span><span>Marcus walk</span><span> away, Ada's expression was a tangle of conflicting emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, when Marcus had asked her to join him, she'd truly considered it. The temptation had been there, but deep down, she knew there were things she had to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't let personal desires stand in the way of her duty to revive the sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, the sudden separation left her unsettled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the fact that Marcus had once forced himself on her, Ada found herself unable to shake the memory of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The emotions stirred by their brief encounter had left her with a strange, lingering attachment. And now, saying goodbye had been harder than she'd ever expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she gritted her teeth, pushed the emotions aside, and forced herself to step forward, heading into the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, had already turned away, unaffected by the departure. He used his teleportation ability to return to the room at Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He understood, perhaps better than anyone, that certain things couldn't be forced. He </span><span>had asked Ada, but if she had chosen not to stay, he wouldn't press it. He'd let her go, knowing there was no point in trying to change her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh... ah... mmm... Pearl, harder, I'm almost there..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back at Bayside Villa, the time difference meant it was already night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had just returned to his room when he was met with a chorus of sounds that set his blood racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mixed with Jane's ragged breaths and moans was that unmistakable edge of raw pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyebrows rose. He glanced towards the bed and found Jane half-reclined against the pillows, completely naked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her flawless body was on full display, legs spread wide, revealing the glistening, overflowing juncture between her thighs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kneeling before her, also nude, was Pearl. The two women were entwined, Pearl holding a vibrating dildo, rhythmically thrusting it in and out of </span><span>Jane's soaked</span><span> core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The buzzing of the device filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each vibration sent shudders of intense pleasure through Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was flushed crimson, her entire being lost in a haze of pure lust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her intimate folds clenched and released around the toy, slick with copious amounts of fluid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene was a potent aphrodisiac, igniting Pearl's own desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two women were a tangle of limbs and flushed skin, their shared moans echoing through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight stopped Marcus dead in his tracks. He was stunned. He hadn't imagined these two were into anything like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Doing this in his room, while he was away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His sudden appearance startled Jane and Pearl so badly they practically jumped out of their skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They froze, thinking they'd seen a ghost, scrambling to cover their nakedness with the bedsheets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only when they got a good look that they realized it was Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell are you two doing?" Marcus asked, a little awkwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd never seen anything like it before, and the scene had definitely left him a bit dry-mouthed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey... we... we missed you so much," Jane stammered, clearly embarrassed. She hopped off the bed and threw herself into Marcus' arms. "We were just... messing around. Please don't be mad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she moved, her large breasts bounced against him, instantly stirring a fire within Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He instinctively gave one a gentle squeeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been about a month since he and Jane had been intimate&mdash;a little time apart could definitely spice things up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her like this, feeling her again, brought a fresh wave of desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That brief touch alone sent a surge of heat through him.</span></p></div>
