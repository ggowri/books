  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada's first instinct was to cover herself with the tattered remnants of her clothing. She stared at Marcus warily. "You filthy beast! Don't you dare look at me. If you do, I'll gouge out your eyes!" she snarled, her voice filled with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada had guarded her virginity for 120 years, only to have it stolen from her without her consent. It was a profound humiliation. At this moment, she even contemplated taking her own life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus laughed. He teased, "I've already seen everything there is to see. What's left to be shy about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no denying that Ada was a stunning beauty. Unlike any woman he knew, she possessed an ethereal quality that made her seem almost otherworldly. Even without an Innate Enchanting Physique, she exuded a subtle, intoxicating, and calming fragrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're despicable! When I return to the Celestial Arc Order, I'll report you to Mr. Spacey. He'll have you killed!" Ada vowed through gritted teeth. Despite the intense pleasure she had experienced, she couldn't overcome the feeling of being violated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To think that the Saintess of the Celestial Arc Order would be so ungrateful. I was wrong about you," Marcus retorted sarcastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada frowned. "How could you possibly have done me any favors? That's ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just check your cultivation level." Marcus was too lazy to explain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada instinctively probed her level of cultivation. To her astonishment, she had broken through a barrier she hadn't been able to surpass for years, reaching the Ancient Martial Stage Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada thought, "How could this be? When was the last time I made such a breakthrough? Could this be an illusion?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada decided to use her inner sight to confirm her findings. The results were undeniable. She was now a full-fledged Ancient Martial Stage Seven expert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My cultivation has improved! What happened? Did you use some kind of dark magic on me?" Ada demanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wouldn't call it dark magic," Marcus chuckled. "I used the power of Dual Cultivation to help you break through your bottleneck."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From what I know, Dual Cultivation is usually about draining a woman's feminine energy to enhance one's own cultivation. The woman is often left weak or even dead. How could your Dual Cultivation have helped me improve?" Ada asked. Without realizing it, she was starting to let her guard down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a perfected form of Dual Cultivation. Any woman who practices it with me will benefit. You're no exception," Marcus explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what, I'll kill you for defiling me!" Ada declared, her tone hardening as she unleashed the full force of her Ancient Martial Stage Seven cultivation. Then, she tried to release a Hand Strike on Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before Ada could strike, Marcus released a wave of overwhelming coercion that enveloped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada was instantly paralyzed, her body trembling as if struck by lightning. Her eyes widened in fear as she realized the truth. "You... you're an Ancient Martial Stage Eight expert!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why is that so surprising?" Marcus chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me, who are you really? Who are your backers?" Ada demanded, her gaze fixed on Marcus, her disbelief evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm just me," Marcus replied coldly. "And let me warn you, neither you nor the Celestial Arc Order should seek revenge. If you do, I'll make you both pay dearly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words were ordinary, yet they left Ada trembling with fear. She didn't dare to disobey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Marcus dispelled his Heavenly Circle Diagram, and they returned to the real world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without lingering, Marcus turned and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada watched him go, her expression a complex mixture of fear and fascination. She bit her lip as if trying to commit his image to memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, is everything taken care of?" Diana asked as Marcus returned to Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded firmly.</span></p><div class="pagination">
