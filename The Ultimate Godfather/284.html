  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Andre's phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Annoyed, he picked up and answered, "Who the hell is this? I'm in the middle of my work. Don't bother me. Call me later!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as he was about to hang up, a voice came from the other end. "This is the Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection. Andre, you are suspected of embezzlement, bribery, and concealing others. We have launched an investigation and have substantial evidence of your crimes. Now, you have been suspended by the city government. Someone will visit your home soon to take a statement. Please be prepared!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was like lightning that struck Andre.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His body trembled wildly and disbelief was written all over his face. The world started to spin and he almost fainted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wait, I can explain!" Andre tried to explain but he was hung up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His whole world was crashing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He turned to Marcu with shock and asked in a shaking voice, "Wh-who are you? Why do you know so much? "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus sneered, "A corrupt official like you is not qualified to know my identity, nor do you have the right to control the bidding!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma looked grim and asked Andre, "Uncle Andre, what's wrong? Did something happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She only heard a few words on the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she was not sure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I was suspended for corruption and bribery, and I may be sent to prison soon. Emma, go back to Solariae immediately and tell your dad about it. He has to get me out of it!" Andre gritted his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, he could only pray for his brother Mark to help him through this difficult time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now she really had to take Marcus seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She just couldn't figure out why Marcus could predict Andre's fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Did he have something to do with the Department of Justice?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone present was dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, they all thought Marcus was just bluffing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if Andre took bribes, how could a young man know this hidden story?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But they never thought that all this was true!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Andre is corrupt and accepts bribes, and the Rivera Construction must be involved. The Department of Justice will investigate this case thoroughly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If such a company becomes the contractor of Bayside Amusement Park, it will inevitably face various problems. So please reconsider the bidding!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' gaze landed on the audit team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The audit team leader took a deep look at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was aware that Marcus had stood up for them too so he announced directly, "We had to change our winner because Andre threatened us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, Andre no longer holds the post of Secretary General of Municipal Government, so Golden Group still won the bid!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, everyone from Golden Group smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Justice delayed is justice denied, but this time it's not.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Andre attempted to change the bidding result by taking advantage of his position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So he had only himself to blame for how he ended up like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All the people in Rivera Construction were sad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were arrogant before but reality gave them a slap in the face!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, you are awesome!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus turned the tide in this situation and made Melina worship him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She now realized how capable this man was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could solve everything!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I told you. The bidding winner can only be the Flourish Group. Tomorrow, I will let Golden Group transfer this business to Flourish Group. You can rest assured," Marcus said to Melina with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melina was stunned and even thought she had heard it wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although she knew that Marcus was linked with Golden Group, she didn't expect that Marcus could control the decision of Golden Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The project of Bayside Amusement Park was a fat meat everyone wanted a bite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus could give it to Melina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melina was shocked, and at the same time, she was very touched. She could not help but kiss Marcus on the face in front of the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Fitzgerald!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
