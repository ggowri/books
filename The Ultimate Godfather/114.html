  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>David trembled, her voice shaking as she said, "M-Mr. Fitzgerald... I had no idea you held such an esteemed status. Please forgive me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This preschool was previously part of an early education company managed by Noah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Technically, it also belonged to the Godfather's network.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcus could get Noah removed with just a word, how could she possibly fare any better?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're so loyal to Noah, then you can join him!" Marcus sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>David's face was filled with despair. She was about to beg further when one of the aides interrupted, "Didn't you hear Mr. Fitzgerald? You're fired too. Get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>David looked dazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had worked at this preschool for many years and enjoyed excellent benefits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he was fired, it was impossible to find another position with the same perks elsewhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, his heart filled with regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cursed his own shortsightedness. If he hadn't been so biased and sided with Noah against Marcus, he wouldn't have ended up like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good... Serves him right to be fired!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted in cheers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the cheering came from the children's parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many of them had experienced unfair treatment from David.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, because the preschool's teaching quality was exceptional, most parents had endured it in silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that didn't mean they didn't resent him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, seeing David fired, their pent-up frustrations were finally released.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, is there anything else you need? If so, we're here to serve you," one of the aides asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lead aide directed the question to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved with a smile. "That's all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The aides exchanged a few pleasantries with Marcus before leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus is amazing..." Leia cheered, her little fists clenched in excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus picked Leia up in one swoop and turned to Josie, who was still in shock. "Ms. Shelman, we can leave now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie nodded stiffly, her mind involuntarily speculating about Marcus's true identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They got into Josie's Mercedes and soon arrived at Sunshine Estates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie smiled and said, "To welcome you properly, Mr. Fitzgerald, I'll cook dinner myself tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't refuse. He didn't know many people in Kingston, and having dinner with Josie sounded like a good idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, it had been a while since they'd last seen each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They bought a variety of groceries at the local fresh market, and once they got home, Josie started cooking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus kept Leia company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never been fond of kids, but he had a soft spot for Leia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't spoiled like most kids her age and was much more mature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leia seemed to adore Marcus too, and they had a great time together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than an hour, Josie had prepared a table full of delicious dishes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I want Marcus to be my dad..." Leia said with childlike innocence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie's cheeks flushed. "Leia, what nonsense are you saying? Marcus can't be your dad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, no, I want Marcus to be my dad..." Leia protested, her eyes welling with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her mom's stern reaction, Leia's eyes turned red, and she started crying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus quickly stepped forward to console her. "Leia, don't cry. How about I be your dad?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leia instantly stopped crying, her face lighting up with a pure, childlike smile. "Okay! Marcus is my dad now! I finally have a dad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Marcus and Leia interact so naturally, Josie felt a little dazed. At that moment, she wished time could stop and stay frozen here forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't just provide her with an overwhelming sense of security&mdash;he gave her a feeling of home. Josie suddenly realized she might not be able to let this man go...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Shelman, Leia will be my goddaughter from now on. You don't mind, do you?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Snapping out of her thoughts, Josie replied, "Of course, I don't mind. Having someone like Mr. Fitzgerald as Leia's godfather is a blessing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them enjoyed a warm and cheerful dinner together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leia fell asleep soon after.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus approached Josie and asked, "Ms. Shelman, have you been feeling unwell lately?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie's cheeks turned crimson as a certain memory crossed her mind. "No, not at all. Since your last treatment, I've felt amazing. Not only is my pain gone, but even my skin has improved so much...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And also..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She trailed off halfway, struggling to continue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What else?" Marcus pressed, curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked, intrigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's just that... during my ovulation period, I feel particularly impulsive, like I want to do things I wouldn't even have dared to imagine before..." Josie finally blurted out, summoning her courage.</span></p><div class="pagination">
