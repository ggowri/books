  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina, at that moment, seemed to be flying in the clouds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ecstasy made her forget herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus pushed harder, each time he entered Melina's vagina, he entered the deepest part.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made her withstand the most intense impact, as if each wave of happiness enveloped her, and each wave was higher than the other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina couldn't stop feeling the thrill she'd never felt before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her vagina constricted and squeezed Marcus, causing him to experience extreme irritation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, you seem to be getting stronger. I feel so good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina looked at Marcus adoringly. Under Marcus' nourishing, Melina seemed to be more beautiful than before, both her demeanor and appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then roll over and kneel on the bed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave Melina an order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina obeyed. That pose would show her round hips to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crevices of the buttocks were visible, and they were covered with milky mucus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus penetrated Melina from behind and slapped her on the buttocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' slap was also a thrill for Melina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She let out a cry of surprise, and it was high tide again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Melina was still having an orgasm, Marcus began to violently thrust her. Melina almost fainted under the double shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus took the opportunity to bring his Dual Cultivation power to the extreme and began his more intense movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah... Um... Marcus, that's too fast. I can't take it anymore. Give me a break! It's so hurt yet too comfortable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina clutched the sheet with her hands and begged for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the stimulation of the double feeling of comfort, the fluid she secreted became more and more vigorous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, she seemed to lose consciousness and lay paralyzed on the bed, at the mercy of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Melina's satisfied expression, Marcus' desire to conquer was also greatly satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He parted Melina's soft thighs again and entered her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina's lost consciousness returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intense thrill made her tremble wildly. She didn't have to spread her legs wide and put them around Marcus' waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This way, every time Marcus thrust, he could touch her sensitive bump.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't take Melina long to reach another climax, with a large amount of liquid gushing out of the gap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The liquid exuded a charming aroma and was wrapped in that charming aroma. Marcus' desire was also mobilized to the peak state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to bear the temptation, he began the final push.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was not only extremely fast, but the amplitude was also unprecedented and lasted about ten minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina's mind went blank, only the pleasure that kept pounding her soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus finally reached his climax, and he infused Melina's body with all his essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina was filled with indescribable satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lay on the bed, gasping for breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body was flushed, sweating, and shaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was satisfied after his release. He got out of bed, lit a cigarette, and sat down on the sofa to smoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smoke after sex was better than living in heaven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked at the woman on the bed he had conquered, filled with a sense of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, he volunteered to join the Winchester family, but he was treated as a waste by Abigail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every day, his dignity was trampled upon, living in frustration and barely surviving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even sacrificed his kidney for Abigail, curing her uremia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But all of this resulted in her betrayal. Abigail cheated on him with Felix and tried to have Marcus killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than half a year, Marcus transformed from someone everyone could despise and humiliate into a powerful figure with billions in assets and reached the Acquired State in cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't even imagine such a change himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This all stemmed from the appearance of the Godfather and the pendant the old man gave him three years ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, although Marcus possessed billions in wealth and extraordinary strength beyond the reach of ordinary people,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>he knew the heavy mission he bore, and the challenges and crises he would face in the future would become increasingly difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, he didn't dare to slack off for a moment and seized every opportunity to improve himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that only by possessing great strength could he stand invincible when facing various crises.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Marcus reminisced about the past, Melina awakened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sat up straight, her eyes still somewhat hazy. She opened her arms and coquettishly said, "Marcus, hold me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled slightly, extinguished his cigarette, and pulled Melina into his embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her rounded and firm breasts pressed against Marcus, and he couldn't help but kiss Melina's lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina let out a soft hum, her face showing satisfaction as she said to Marcus, "Marcus, I love you so much. Promise me you won't leave me in the future, okay? No matter how many women you have later, you can't leave me. Promise me, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded vigorously. He kissed Melina on the forehead and said, "Silly girl, how could you think like that? I definitely won't leave you, unless you leave me first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina covered Marcus' mouth with her hand and said, "Don't say that. I could never leave you. You know I really, really love you. This past month has felt like a year. I think of you every day. I even wanted to go to </span><span>Solomia</span><span> to find you, but there are too many issues with my family, and I just can't get away. I can only silently endure this longing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina's confession was heartfelt. Marcus could see that it was her true feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Melina's exquisite and alluring face, Marcus couldn't suppress his inner emotion and kissed her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina's body trembled slightly, but she did not refuse, yet she responded to Marcus excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The desire they had just extinguished reignited at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina's body began to flush again, her intoxicating fragrance wafting through the air. She became aroused once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus pressed her down, wanting to start the second round.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at that moment, a penetrating bright light shone through the window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with the blackout curtains drawn, the light still penetrated into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a cold voice came through, "Marcus, this villa is surrounded. Come out and face your death."</span></p><div class="pagination">
