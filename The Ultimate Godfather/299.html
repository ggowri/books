  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Nick, what's wrong with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dad, don't scare me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this scene, Aria and Lisa panicked right away as they rushed forward to check on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick was twitching and looked pale. He rolled his eyes and was in a state of shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The patients in the queue exclaimed as they stepped back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Richard and Melinda looked shocked, and they were anxious in their minds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick was fine before that. He had only been in line for a while, but why did he suddenly have an attack?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Lisa, do something. Your dad is dying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick said with an anxious look on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Doctor, doctor, come out right now! My dad is sick, and save my dad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lisa couldn't think much longer and rushed into Cary's office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cary was seeing other patients, and he was also startled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Upon hearing that a patient was having an emergency, he immediately left his work in hand and walked out quickly to check on Nick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He's in an acute cerebral infarction attack. His blood vessels have blocked to a very severe state, so he's in acute shock. Well, you're too late, and I'm afraid he's not going to survive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cary confirmed Nick's symptoms straight away by checking on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had delayed too long, and Nick's condition got completely worse, reaching a state of dying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No, it's absolutely impossible. My dad was just fine, and he was even talking and laughing with us. Doctor, help him!" Lisa cried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick was so sick, and she would have brought him to the hospital a long time ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I have no idea. Even if he's in the period of disease, I can't see how serious the symptoms are, and that's the case with your dad. If nothing else, you can prepare his funeral," Cary said with a sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aria and Lisa just felt like it was all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aria was even almost passing out as she cried her eyes out. "Nick, you said you felt sick the other day, but I didn't take it seriously. I was to blame, and it was all my fault!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Also, you waited in line at the hospital for so long today. If you saw a doctor earlier, you would have been fine. Nick, I feel sorry for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Allan looked embarrassed on the sidelines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though it didn't have much to do with him, seeing Nick's treatment delayed because of the long queue at the hospital made him feel so guilty in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, what are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cary was just about to leave when he saw Marcus not far away, so he rushed up to greet Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was a director of a department, and moreover, he was one of the top professors in the entire cardiovascular department in Uswad. At this moment, he even greeted Marcus actively, and he looked incredibly respectful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This attracted quite a few people's attention right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who the hell is this young man? Cary even greeted him voluntarily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Grant is a top professor, and there aren't many people who can make him so respectful. This young man doesn't look simple."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It must be so, but I don't understand why this family has kept the patient here in line for so long since this young man knows Mr. Grant. As long as this young man tells Mr. Grant, Mr. Grant can be the first to see him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this scene, the onlookers were talking about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing that Cary greeted Marcus voluntarily, Allan, Lisa, and Aria were stunned, and they looked unbelievable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Grant, do you know Marcus?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lisa couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cary said, "Not only do we know each other, but Mr. Fitzgerald is someone I need to respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you the family of Mr. Fitzgerald?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as he finished speaking, Allan, Lisa and Aria were surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They couldn't believe that Cary knew Marcus, and that he treated Marcus with such respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They never dreamed that the man they considered useless would know Cary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, Marcus is my nephew."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aria held back her shock and nodded to Cary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hey, why didn't you tell me earlier? Since he's a relative of Mr. Fitzgerald, if the head of the hospital knew about this, the whole hospital would have been at your service, not to mention our department. It wouldn't have happened!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Aria's words, Cary sighed with regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't figure out what the family was thinking about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since they were related to Marcus, why didn't they ask for his help? A man just lost the best time for his treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cary knew that Marcus had cured a terminal cancer patient all by himself, and it was a rare ovarian cancer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When this news spread, the head of the hospital had personally invited Marcus to be the honorary advisor of their hospital, enjoying the same treatment as the head of the hospital, but Marcus refused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If a relative of a big shot like Marcus came to the hospital to see a doctor, it would give their hospital respect and even more honor.</span></p><div class="pagination">
