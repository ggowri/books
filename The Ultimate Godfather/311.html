  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How do you feel now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In order to ensure foolproof, Jade changed to another color ultrasound machine, but the results were still the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade asked the middle-aged woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The woman was full of energy and replied with a smile, "I am fine now. And I'm much more energetic than before, as if I had never been sick!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade was surprised again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Appendicitis was not a serious illness. But it was the first time for Jade to see the way to make the patient recover without surgery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were almost no such treatments in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Jade saw it today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ironically, she always mistakenly thought that Marcus was a peeping tom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade suddenly felt a little ashamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "The man has my father's phone number. They may know each other!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade suddenly thought of a possibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The medical communities of different cities were interconnected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A lot of people in medicine knew each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More importantly, more than a month ago, Robert had a phone conversation with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It proved that Marcus was also a medical person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking, Jade hurried home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this time, visitors came to her house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were two foreign men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were old and young, and their looks were quite similar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Westoners were generally tall, and these two men were no exception.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were over six feet tall. Although the old man was over seventy years old, he looked energetic and powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jade, you said you would be home in over an hour. What took you so long?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Robert asked Jade disapprovingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had important visitors, but Jade didn't take it seriously. Robert was somewhat angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Something happened to me on the way here." Jade explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jade, come here. I'd like you to meet Jordon Cole from Acoton and his grandson, Mike Cole." Robert smiled and said to Jade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade politely greeted the two men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Robert had rushed Jade home so she could meet these two men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Actually, Jade was not interested in meeting the two, but Robert had repeatedly asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You are more beautiful than the legend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mike stepped forward and looked at Jade with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was gentlemanly and tried to be friendly to Jade with the courtesy of Weston Land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade had never been interested in the culture of Weston Land and subconsciously stayed away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made Mike slightly freeze, and his eyes became cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, it was well concealed by him and was soon replaced by a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Robert was embarrassed and thought Jade was not sensible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon was a world-renowned medical expert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Robert had a hard time inviting Jordon home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The reason why Robert asked Jade to go home was to let Jade in Jordon's help to Acoton study.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once she returned from her studies, her medical attainments would make a leap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Robert wanted Jade to take over his position as chief of surgery when he retired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In order to alleviate the embarrassment, Robert asked Jade, "You said that you were delayed to go home because of some things. What happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade was just about to prove Marcus' identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, she told Robert what had happened on the train in detail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Robert looked surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hurriedly asked Jade, "Is the young man you mentioned about six feet tall and handsome in appearance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade immediately nodded. "Yes. Dad, do you really know him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald... The person you met should be Mr. Fitzgerald. He actually came to Solariae!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Robert was excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He remembered Marcus' handsome face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grandpa, is there really anyone in this world who can treat severe shock patients with appendicitis perforation without surgery?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mike heard the conversation between Robert and Jade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, Mike asked disdainfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon winked, "I have been practicing medicine for many years, and my students are all over the world. And now, they have achieved something. I have never heard of anyone who can treat appendicitis patients without surgery. Nonsense!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
