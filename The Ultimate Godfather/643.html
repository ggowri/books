        <h1>Chapter 642 Michelle's Embarrassment</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're a complete liar. Didn't you say you'd help me? How could you do this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled, his voice teasing. "Well, in a way, this is part of the treatment. Don't you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While speaking, Marcus began to thrust harder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He carried Yvonne's legs on his shoulders, and her vagina was completely exposed to his sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dense public hair and the slightly protruding gap were clearly visible, completely arousing Marcus' desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sucked the tits on her breasts while thrusting her holes wildly, touching Yvonne's deepest area every time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus... it's so comfortable. I feel filled up by you. Can you be a little harder? Please..." Yvonne purred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the power of Marcus' Dual Cultivation, their pleasure surged, and Yvonne was overwhelmed by a wave of long-missed ecstasy, bringing her to orgasm once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A steady stream of warm, slippery fluid flowed from her gap, sending waves of intense pleasure through Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus and Yvonne were caught up in their heated moment, Michelle rushed over from Golden Group after hearing the news that McHale Pharmaceutical Group's people had arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stepped into the elevator, asked the staff, and found out that Yvonne had returned to her office, so she made her way there to find her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before Michelle could knock on the door, she heard waves of moaning coming from the office. But before she could even knock on the door, a series of loud, unmistakable moans drifted from inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle's face turned bright red, and she instantly realized what was happening behind that door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She, who hadn't had sex for a long time, suddenly reacted. She felt a warm current surging in her lower abdomen and finally gathered in her vagina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but feel a little wet, a soft groan escaping her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus is actually doing something so embarrassing in broad daylight..." Michelle thought to herself, and her mind couldn't help but wander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing outside the office, she had to fight the urge and do her best to stay calm, trying to redirect her attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the room, Marcus and Yvonne were completely lost in their passion, oblivious to the fact that Michelle was right outside the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus thrusted violently, her desire reached its peak and burst out directly, bringing her to orgasm for the fourth time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body shook uncontrollably, as if jolted by an electric current, and she sank helplessly into the spot, breath coming in sharp gasps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sofa was soaked, and the air was thick with the unmistakable, heady scent of a woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus exhaled deeply, reclining on the couch, feeling the tension in his body dissolve completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He poured himself a cup of coffee and took a slow sip, savoring the warm, rich taste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, Yvonne finally snapped back to reality, still flushed from the sex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shot Marcus a playful glare and teased, "You said to help me, but look what you've done."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As their encounters grew more intimate, Yvonne began to understand the true pleasure of being with a man, and she felt both her body and mind unwind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stress in her body melted away, leaving her feeling completely revitalized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder they say love makes a woman glow. Turns out, men really are a woman's best beauty secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before they had even finished getting dressed, there was a knock on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both of them froze for a moment, quickly trying to straighten themselves out before opening the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Michelle, when did you get here?" Yvonne asked, her face flushing with a mixture of surprise and nervousness, clearly worried that Michelle might have caught on to what had just happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh... I just got here," Michelle replied, her eyes scanning Marcus and Yvonne for a brief moment, forcing a strained smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I came because I heard McHale Pharmaceuticals Group is trying to acquire our drug patents."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's already been handled by Marcus. You don't need to worry about it," Yvonne said, instinctively touching her heated face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the mirror across the room, she could clearly see her flushed cheeks, a clear giveaway of what had transpired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, that's a relief. You two go ahead and chat. I'll head back to my work now," Michelle said awkwardly, giving a quick smile before turning to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne shot Marcus a reproachful glance, blaming her embarrassment on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus shrugged and said, "I've got some things to take care of. I'll catch up with you another time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go on. Go on. You're always so busy. I won't keep you." Yvonne waved him off, thinking that if he could visit her once every two weeks, she'd be content.</span></p></div>
