        <h1>Chapter 678 Dutton's Cultivation Was Destroyed</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a threat from Dutton.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed that, being one of the three major Ancient Martial Art Sects in Uswad, the Celestial Arc Order still instilled fear in ordinary warriors despite the death of its patriarch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as he mentioned its name, almost no one in Uswad would dare to provoke him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was confident that the same would go for Marcus and that he would definitely not dare to harm him because of the reputation of the Celestial Arc Order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sneered and punched Dutton in the lower abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a loud bang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dutton let out a miserable scream. His lower abdomen exploded, and all his cultivation was completely obliterated, reducing him to an ordinary individual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a livid face, he roared at Marcus, "H-How dare you! Just wait. I will ask the elders of the sect to kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled indifferently, "As a warrior, you are showing off your strength in the mundane world. If I didn't ruin your cultivation, you would still do evil. Get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, he casually threw Dutton off the ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dutton fell heavily to the floor, wailing in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, this scene dumbfounded everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected that a formidable figure like Dutton would prove no match for Marcus and that Marcus would effortlessly defeat him with just a single strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, they were not on par with each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' strength was far beyond Dutton's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Carroll!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Below the ring, several people from the Apis Boxing Club promptly stepped forward and helped Dutton up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was etched with despair. He cast a glance at Marcus in the ring and said, "I'll remember what happened today. Let's wait and see!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he left with his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, they came to challenge the Iron Fist Club with sufficient preparations to build momentum for the opening of branches and attract more attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had anticipated that their plans would be perfectly carried out after Moreno defeated Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, everything was ruined after Marcus appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All their plans failed, and even Dutton's cultivation was destroyed by Marcus!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dutton was well aware that the elders of the sect wouldn't turn a blind eye to his suffering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the loss of his cultivation made him a good-for-nothing, and all the years of his painstaking efforts had come to naught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was far more agonizing for him than being killed outright. In an instant, his hatred for Marcus surged to an all-time high!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Dutton and his men walk away in disgrace, the members of the Iron Fist Club erupted into thunderous applause, cheering for Marcus and gazing at him with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, thank you so much. Without your help, I really have no idea how the Iron Fist Club could have gotten through this difficult time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia approached Marcus with a look of gratitude and intended to say more to convey just how thankful she was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just waved his hand at her and replied, "Shannon and I are friends, so you don't have to be so polite to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at him with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, Mr. Fitzgerald, I'll treat you to dinner tonight to show my appreciation. Let's have a gathering. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people who were defending the club let out cheers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Marcus said, "No need. I have other things to do, so I'm leaving now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staring at his receding figure back, Ophelia winked at Shannon and whispered, "Shannon, I will leave it to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon nodded with a grin. "Okay, Ms. Perkins."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she promptly caught up with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, wait for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, they got into the Aston Martin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon smiled, "Mr. Fitzgerald, I know you don't like to dine with outsiders. How about I join you for a meal instead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled, "I'm not hungry yet, so a meal is not necessary. Stay here with me for a while."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon nodded slightly. Something flashed across her mind, causing her pretty face to blush a little.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you still have cramps?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon gave a slight nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can treat it," Marcus laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, he had already activated the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Strands of Timeless Numinous Energy surged in his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, before Shannon could make a sound, Marcus placed his palms on her lower abdomen, where a warm sensation suddenly coursed through and penetrated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An incredibly intense sense of comfort rapidly spread throughout every part of her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, Shannon let out an excited moan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she was in the midst of her menstrual cycle at that very moment, her entire body felt as if it had been subjected to some powerful form of stimulation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following that sense of comfort, a faint blush returned to Shannon's pale cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An inexplicable feeling of emptiness suddenly arose in her private area and instantly swept through her entire body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' Timeless Numinous Energy seeped into her, steadily dispelling the chill within her body.</span></p></div>
