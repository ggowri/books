        <h1>Chapter 439 Taking Her Away</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Christopher gestured to the people behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They began unloading wedding gifts from the car and setting them in the courtyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Christopher opened his briefcase, revealing stacks of crisp bills. "Simon, here's the remaining 1.68 million dollars. Once you accept this, the marriage agreement is sealed, and I'll take her right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Christopher spoke, his gaze swept over Jane, silently appraising her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Deep in thought, Christopher eyed her figure appreciatively. "With those curves, she'll definitely give my Bobby sons. Finally, my million-dollar empire will have an heir," he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gave a subtle signal to his men behind him, who immediately understood and moved to forcibly take Jane away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Back off." Before they could reach Jane, Marcus stepped in front of her protectively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Christopher's brow furrowed as he turned to Simon. "Simon, who's this guy? Why's he sticking his nose in our business?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Simon replied through gritted teeth, "Don't worry about him, Mr. Cain. Just take the girl."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Christopher turned back to Marcus with a threatening sneer. "Listen, man. This isn't your business. Let go of the girl, and let me take her. If anything happens to you, I won't be responsible for the consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After all, in this town, people disappear all the time. No one dares to ask questions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words dripped with menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before he finished speaking, some of his men had already retrieved weapons from their vehicles - iron bars and machetes - quickly distributing them to the others as they surrounded Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bad people came from bad places. In these parts, Christopher was practically a king. No one dared to cross him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More importantly, he was dead set on finding a wife for his son Bobby to continue the family line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd go to war with anyone who stood in his way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Almost simultaneously, two men armed with iron bars approached Jane, trying to subdue her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hey, see this rod? If you keep sticking your nose where it doesn't belong, my rod might just slip." The man threatened Marcus, waving the weapon menacingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Honey, what should we do?" Jane whispered fearfully. She knew all too well how remote their small town was. Christopher wielded considerable influence here, having connections with both legitimate authorities and criminal elements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She recalled how someone who had crossed Christopher once had mysteriously vanished from town a few days later. No one ever found out what happened to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, it was clear that Christopher had come to here well-prepared with so many men in tow. Jane worried Marcus might be at a disadvantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry," Marcus reassured her with a confident look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are you all standing around for? Take the girl, now!" Christopher snapped impatiently at his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His two subordinates nodded immediately and moved to grab her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before they could lay a hand on Jane, Marcus struck with lightning speed, landing two powerful punches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The men crashed to the ground, groaning in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The rest of Christopher's gang grew furious at the sight. They couldn't believe someone had dared to attack their own men on their turf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And he came alone, which was practically suicide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get him! Break his legs. Teach him a lesson," Christopher roared at his men in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The remaining thugs, armed with iron bars and machetes, numbered around twenty. They were essentially a small criminal gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They all rushed at Marcus at once, their attacks vicious and aimed at his vital points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Heh, this punk dares to interfere with Mr. Cain getting his son a wife. What an idiot. I can't wait to see his legs get broken by Mr. Cain's men," Lucas sneered, crossing his arms as he watched the show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, look at this guy playing hero. He clearly doesn't know his own limits," Tracy said to Lucas. "Don't worry. Mr. Cain obviously came prepared this time. Once Jane marries Bobby, all of Dad's money will be yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lucas nodded slightly, his eyes gleaming with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Almost simultaneously, the confrontation in the courtyard erupted into violence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus remained perfectly calm as he faced down more than twenty armed attackers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He moved forward casually, his fists striking out with an aura of invincibility. The men with their iron bars were no match for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A series of rapid thuds echoed through the air as Marcus' fists rained down on his opponents like a storm. Each punch dropped another attacker to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The air filled with screams of pain and the sickening sound of breaking bones. In less than a minute, all attackers lay defeated on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet Marcus' expression remained serene, his breathing steady, as if nothing had happened at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Christopher and Simon's family stood there dumbfounded. They never would have dreamed this pretty boy could fight like that.</span></p></div>
