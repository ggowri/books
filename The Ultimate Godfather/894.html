        <h1>Chapter 861 The Senior Military Advisor-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine grew impatient when she noticed Marcus' strange expression and prolonged silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always been a firecracker, having little patience for people who dragged their feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if I told you that I am the Special Advisor? Would you believe that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked Maxine directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine rolled her eyes at Marcus and said, "Come on, Marcus, cut the jokes. I'm trying to have a serious conversation here! Opportunities like this don't come around daily!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that Maxine didn't believe a word Marcus was saying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Marcus had always impressed her with his capabilities, Maxine couldn't convince herself that Marcus was the one who had saved Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll go with you then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Maxine's disbelief, Marcus decided against further explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew how stubborn she could be. Once she made up her mind about something, no explanation would change it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only when she discovered the truth for herself would she change her perspective.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like when they were pursuing the Black Hawk Legion's leader, Marcus had shared his strategy from the start.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Maxine had dismissed his ideas ultimately, accusing him of slacking off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until Marcus turned the situation around and proved himself that Maxine finally recognized her mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When Cody gets here, I'll tell him so I can take you along with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Commander Ashford values this Special Advisor. Even though you hold a high position in </span><span>Solomia</span><span> yourself, they're also from </span><span>Solomia</span><span>, so building a good relationship with them can only benefit you. I hope you take this seriously."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine said with motherly concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was worried that Marcus wouldn't take this matter seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, several military vehicles drove up the mountain road and quickly pulled up in front of the police car, where Marcus and Maxine were waiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several uniformed soldiers stepped down from the military vehicles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leading them was a tall, imposing young military officer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He appeared to be around Marcus' age, in his early twenties. Yet, he already wore the rank of lieutenant colonel with two bars and two stars on his shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For someone in their early twenties, the rank of lieutenant colonel was quite impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine said to Marcus as she spotted them arriving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had been dozing off, and when Maxine called, he jolted awake with a drowsy expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get out. Cody and his team have arrived."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine reminded him again, shooting him another disapproving look when she saw he had fallen asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't seem to understand his behavior at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had informed Marcus about the upcoming meeting with the Special Advisor. By any logical reasoning, he shouldn't have been sleeping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He should have used this limited time to prepare thoroughly and present himself to meet such an essential figure in the best possible state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he had chosen to take a long nap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, opportunities like this were rare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Maxine hadn't begged Cody for this favor, she wouldn't have had the chance to meet someone of this caliber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made Maxine feel like Marcus wasn't taking this matter seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was at a loss for words about Marcus' behavior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine stepped out of the car first, followed by Marcus from the driver's seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young Lieutenant Colonel was none other than Cody, the son of the </span><span>Rowane</span><span> District Commander and a senior staff officer of the </span><span>Rowane</span><span> Military District.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being only in his early twenties with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, Cody commanded an inexplicable yet powerful presence just by standing there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a decorated graduate of the International Military Academy, and his capabilities were genuine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This commanding presence stemmed from his self-confidence and absolute faith in his abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Cody saw Marcus and Maxine getting out of the patrol car together, his brows furrowed slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He addressed Maxine, "Officer Burnett, who might this be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine responded, "This is my boyfriend, Marcus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given the intimate nature of their relationship, it was natural for her to refer to him as her boyfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though she felt somewhat awkward saying those words, Maxine was trying to adapt to the new situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Cody's forehead creased with concern as he remarked, "Since when did Officer Burnett get a boyfriend? The Burnett family told me you were single!"</span></p></div>
