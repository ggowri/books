  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Officers, this is a family matter," Simon sneered. "Even though you're from the SWAT team, don't you think you have overstepped by getting involved in our personal affairs?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus almost laughed out loud at the hypocrisy of Simon's family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Earlier, when Tristan had called Riley and the others, they'd been bragging about how powerful Tristan was, trying to get the SWAT team to arrest him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now that the SWAT officers were on Marcus' side, their attitude had completely shifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, they started downplaying Marcus' connections, and even tried to use Tristan's family wealth to save face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They argued that this was just a family issue, that the SWAT officers shouldn't be involved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To be honest, Jane's relatives weren't much to speak of, but when it came to talking nonsense, they were top-tier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Captains, don't listen to him." Jane's voice suddenly rang out. "He's trying to trap me and force me to marry Christopher Cain's son. When I refused, that's when all this chaos started, and he called you here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her voice grew stronger. "They've been involved in human trafficking. I want you to investigate this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Miles and Riley quickly stepped forward, eager to hear more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course they would.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They'd been looking for a way to get on Marcus' good side, and Jane's statement gave them just the excuse they needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After listening to Jane's account, Miles and Riley's expressions turned cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their eyes flicked over to Christopher and Simon's family, and Miles spoke with a steely edge, "Based on what she's said, you're clearly involved in human trafficking. Especially you, Christopher, and Simon. You've been part of the transaction, and the amount of money involved is huge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He continued, "Therefore, in the name of the Ganston SWAT team, we are officially placing you under arrest!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before anyone could react, Miles gestured sharply to the SWAT officers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, they moved in, surrounding Christopher and the Dowson family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Christopher and Simon's family were stunned. They were from a small town in the mountains&mdash;this was a level of authority and force they had never seen before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Christopher, panic setting in, shouted, "I'm the mayor! You can't arrest me! Let me go right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Miles laughed darkly, "So you're the mayor? That doesn't give you immunity. You're involved in human trafficking, you've been leading a gang, and the situation is far worse than you realize."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He added, "As mayor, you should be setting an example for others. Instead, you've become a corrupt thug. You're making everything worse for your town&mdash;and now, you'll pay the price."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Christopher's face fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He never imagined that his scheme to marry off his son would spiral so far out of control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking back, he realized how reckless he'd been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bringing dozens of men, armed with weapons, into the daylight&mdash;he had abandoned every shred of dignity a public official was supposed to have. This was straight out of a mob movie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Filled with regret, Christopher thought, "I should've never let power blind me. I got too arrogant, and now it's all coming down on me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jane, you ungrateful witch! After everything we've done for you, this is how you repay us? Not only do you turn on us, but you call the cops on your own family! I've known all along you were a cold-hearted person. No wonder Mom used to beat you. Honestly, I don't know why she didn't just end it back then. She should've just let you go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tracy was completely falling apart, screaming at Jane as she was restrained by a couple of SWAT officers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lucas joined in, rage in his voice, "You don't deserve to be part of our family. You've gone completely cold-hearted. And when your karma hits, you'll see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I can't believe I have a daughter like you. If I had known... I would've never let you come back," Simon roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He, holding onto his walking stick, shook his head in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Jane watched her family members being handcuffed, a pang of emotion hit her, but it was gone in an instant. Her eyes hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Family?" Jane's voice was icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When have you ever treated me like family? To you, I was just a cash machine. As long as I had money, you were all over me. The second I didn't, you turned on me. You even tried to sell me off to Bobby Cain for a dowry of 1.88 million dollars. Is that what family does?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She continued, "Don't act like you care now. You were the ones who wanted to cut ties with me in the first place, and I agreed. So from now on, we're strangers. Whether you live or die, it has nothing to do with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her voice broke as she spoke, the pent-up anger and sorrow spilling out in her words. Two tears slid down her face, but her expression was resolute.</span></p><div class="pagination">
