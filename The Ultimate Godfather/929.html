  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was another explosion. Prins thought that his full-strength attack could offset Marcus' Fist Ray.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he overestimated his strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This fist of Marcus was far more terrifying than he imagined.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The destructive force contained in the Fist Ray directly shattered his attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the power of Marcus' Fist Ray did not weaken at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It fell on Prins' body in just a blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Prins' body trembled wildly and was immediately wrapped by the destructive force.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was directly blown away. When he landed, he spit out a mouthful of blood and his face was pale!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And such an attack actually directly destroyed Prins' cultivation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His face was extremely desperate. He looked at Marcus with resentment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You actually advanced to the Return Essence stage?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alison was also stunned. Her azure eyes were full of shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Alison went to </span><span>Uswad</span><span> to kill Marcus, he was just an expert who had just been promoted to Ancient Martial Stage Eight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In just over a month, Marcus had advanced from the Foundation Establishment Stage to the Return Essence stage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This speed of cultivation shocked Alison.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She still vaguely remembered that it took her more than 50 years to advance from the Foundation Establishment Stage to the Return Essence stage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus only took one month. This speed difference was hard to describe in words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You didn't know?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus was very surprised by Alison's reaction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because he had just killed two Return Essence stage warriors from </span><span>Uswad</span><span> a few days ago.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of them was named Damien. Marcus took out a notebook from Damien's Spatial Ring.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This notebook was equivalent to Damien's personal biography. Everything about him was recorded in that notebook, including his coming to </span><span>Solomia</span><span> to kill Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It clearly stated that they were sent by Roger to kill Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alison was Roger's woman. Marcus thought she had known about this for a long time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seemed that Roger would not share everything with Alison.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Know what?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alison was confused.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, she was completely occupied by anger at the moment and had no intention to ask Marcus in detail.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She turned her eyes and asked Prins with concern, "Prins, how are you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She asked this because she had a magical pill.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It could restore the cultivation of Demon Fighter. Prins' cultivation was destroyed by Marcus, but as long as he took this pill, he could recover.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Boom!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, before Prins could answer, there was a sound of explosion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Prins' body exploded, turning into debris and flesh scattered all over the ground!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The air was filled with blood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alison's face became even more livid.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She instantly understood that Marcus' attack not only destroyed Prins' cultivation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Prins' body had long been implanted with a terrible destructive force. It was just that this destructive force had a delayed effect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It had not completely erupted until a few seconds ago, causing Prins' body to explode.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And this was simply a provocation to Alison.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another man next to Alison couldn't stand it anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said to Alison, "This man killed my brother. I must avenge Prins. Ms. Krauss, I will kill him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, he stepped out, and endless flames rose around him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He seemed to be the god of fire, and the temperature suddenly rose wherever he passed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rolling heat waves spread in all directions on his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And his cultivation had reached level three of Demon Fighter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His state was already equivalent to Marcus' Ancient Martial Stage Three.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Marcus was a man who cultivated a Hidden State. More importantly, the various methods he cultivated were top-notch.</span></p><div class="pagination">
