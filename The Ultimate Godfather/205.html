  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was taken aback, their eyes fixed on Matthew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the astonishment on Matthew's face, Malcolm stepped forward and asked, "Dad, what's going on? What are you saying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Matthew's eyes, usually so weathered, were now filled with excitement. He looked at Marcus and said, his voice trembling slightly, "Just as this young man said, he's gotten every one of my symptoms right!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment those words left his mouth, everyone froze, their expressions filled with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of them began to wonder if Marcus really could cure Matthew's illness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, there was no way he could have guessed Matthew's symptoms without being accurate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm was stunned, but he couldn't bring himself to believe that a young man barely in his twenties could have such skill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly spoke to Matthew, "Dad, even though he guessed your symptoms correctly, I think it's just luck. You can't trust him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people in the room nodded in agreement with Malcolm's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, it was almost supernatural for someone to deduce Matthew's symptoms with just a glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all from Kingston's upper crust, having encountered countless famous doctors, but not a single one could do what Marcus had just done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm's words served as a reminder to the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Matthew, things didn't seem as simple as they appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Marcus and asked, "Young man, how did you figure out my symptoms? Is it possible that this pill really has the power to heal my condition?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled lightly and replied, "It's not hard to tell from your appearance. Symptoms like these are easy to spot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Matthew immediately gestured for someone to take the pill and pass it to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he swallowed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, no! You can't do this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Matthew actually take the pill, Malcolm panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, Marcus was definitely a fraud. Not to mention whether the pill was effective or not; if it were poisonous, Matthew could be in serious danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest of the Burnett family looked on with similar concern, and some even suggested calling an ambulance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, with Matthew's age, he couldn't handle any unnecessary risks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pill slid down Matthew's throat and into his stomach, where it was quickly absorbed, circulating through his bloodstream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within just two minutes, Matthew felt a warmth spreading throughout his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flow of his blood became much smoother, far more so than it had been before, and the powerful medicinal effect quickly spread through his system.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Matthew noticed that his breathing had eased, and his body felt full of energy. He stood up straighter, and his spirits lifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, to everyone's astonishment, Matthew stood up from his wheelchair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did he stand up steadily, but he stood straight without leaning on the cane that had been by his side!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He... he's standing up! Sir Burnett, he's really standing up! How is that possible? How could this happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could that little pill really have the effect he claimed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone stared, eyes wide with disbelief. The room erupted in shock!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, you're really standing? How do you feel? Is anything bothering you? Do you feel any pain?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen rushed forward, his face filled with joy, ready to offer his support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew, now standing, looked more energetic than ever. His complexion had turned a healthy shade of red, and he seemed full of strength, no longer the frail figure he had once been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh My, this is unbelievable!" He exclaimed, his voice filled with awe, turning toward Marcus with gratitude in his eyes. "I feel incredible! It's like I've turned back twenty years. I'm full of energy, and all those aches and pains I've been suffering from are completely gone. This is amazing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, the crowd's shock intensified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their gazes toward Marcus had completely changed, now filled with awe and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine, along with the rest of the Burnett family, stood there with their mouths agape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were more familiar with Matthew's condition than anyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the doctors, though his illness was not immediately life-threatening, it would gradually drain his vitality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within a few years, his blood and energy would be depleted, and that would mark the end of his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Matthew looked like a completely different person. It was hard to believe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of them even wondered if they were hallucinating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never imagined that a simple pill could have such a profound effect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine looked at Marcus, her eyes filled with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since meeting him, Marcus had continuously performed miracles in front of her.</span></p><div class="pagination">
