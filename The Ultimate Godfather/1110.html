From where </span><span>Marcus</span><span> </span><span>wa</span><span>s standing, the interior of the forest </span><span>wa</span><span>s completely obscured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even </span><span>h</span><span>is spiritual sense to probe </span><span>wa</span><span>s </span><span>not helpful</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's going on?

I'll break it right now!"</span><span> </span><span>Marcus</span><span> spoke calmly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, </span><span>Gertie</span><span> saw </span><span>Marcus</span><span> wave his hand, with array patterns surging in his palm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These people seemed to communicate with heaven and earth, containing extremely powerful </span><span>Rune power</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As </span><span>Marcus</span><span> uttered the word, he waved his hand forward, and those </span><span>Currents</span><span> unexpectedly detached from his palm</span><span>, q</span><span>uickly merging with the space ahead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Buzz, buzz..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next moment, strange sounds echoed, and after those </span><span>Currents</span><span> merged, the dense forest began to blur.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eventually, it completely vanished, replaced by a brand-new reflection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A towering cliff, sharp as if carved by a blade, soared straight into the clouds.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the cliff, a cave was being carved, appearing bottomless from the outside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two figures were guarding the entrance of the cave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These two had no disguise, with snake heads and human bodies, exuding an eerie and sinister vibe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>Marcus</span><span>, that </span><span>must be where they are keeping the girls</span><span>. Let's go check it out now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie</span><span> said with a bright look in her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus</span><span> nodded, and the two of them went to the entrance together.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two immediately noticed </span><span>Marcus</span><span> and </span><span>Gertie</span><span> and asked, "Who are you? Don't you know this is </span><span>f</span><span>orbidden</span><span> ground</span><span>? If you don't want to die, you'd better get out of here now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Almost at the same time, the gaze of the other </span><span>one</span><span> fell on </span><span>Gertie</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He saw</span><span> how young and beautiful she wa</span><span>s and</span><span> a trace of greed immediately appeared in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't help but say, "The man can leave, but the woman must stay!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus</span><span> glanced at the two, a mocking smile curling at the corner of his mouth, and said, "You'd better think about whether you have a chance to survive first!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, his </span><span>spiritual</span><span> sense</span><span>s</span><span> had already been released, enveloping the bodies of the </span><span>Ophidian</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly discovered that the cultivation of the two was merely at the </span><span>Acquired State</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such cultivation was nothing more than insignificant ants to </span><span>Marcus</span><span>, who had mastered a </span><span>H</span><span>idden </span><span>State</span><span> and reached the peak of the Acquired State</span><span> Six</span><span>!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, these two couldn't discern </span><span>Marcus</span><span>'s true cultivation level at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They exchanged a glance, then a mocking smile curled at the corners of their mouths.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of the </span><span>Ophidians</span><span> said, "</span><span>You are just </span><span>a mere captive</span><span>. </span><span>I really don't know where you get the courage to speak to us like this?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Seems like you </span><span>have a death wish</span><span>. Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, the snake man extended his large hand directly, grabbing toward </span><span>Marcus</span><span> as if an eagle snatching a chick!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus</span><span> </span><span>remained calm in place. Before the </span><span>his</span><span> palm could land, he directly grabbed the other's wrist.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then he forcefully twisted it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A cracking sound of a bone breaking was heard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The opponent's wrist was directly broken, with ghastly white bones exposed, looking extremely horrifying!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The </span><span>creature</span><span> let out a piercing scream and gritted his teeth, saying, "Prisoner, you&rsquo;ve ruined my arm. I will kill you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, an extremely terrifying aura erupted from him, and he launched a desperate attack toward </span><span>Marcus</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Seeking death!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus</span><span> raised his eyebrow slightly and directly unleashed a </span><span>F</span><span>ist </span><span>Ray,</span><span> colliding with the opponent's attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A terrifying rumble echoed as an incredibly destructive force spread in all directions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The </span><span>creature</span><span> felt an irresistible force descend, enveloping his body in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He let out a miserable scream, unable to withstand it any longer. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His body was directly blasted away, his internal organs shattered, and he became a lifeless corpse!</span></p><div class="pagination">
