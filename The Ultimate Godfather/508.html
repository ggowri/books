        <h1>Chapter 507 What Are You Trying to Do</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll see just how many lies you can come up with!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Tom said this, Neil, Landon, and Cloe stopped trying to stop Marcus. Instead, they waited to see him make a fool of himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus cast a glance at Tom and then said, "You experience excruciating pain in your head, abdomen, and chest every time the full moon rises, and the pain subsides when you strike those areas forcefully, am I right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Landon sneered, "Look at this guy, speaking with such confidence. If I didn't know he liked to talk nonsense, I might actually believe him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neil also scoffed, "Yeah, I have no idea how my niece ended up with this clown. He claims to be worth billions of dollars. I even doubt that Golden Group belongs to him. He doesn't have the traits of a wealthy person at all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, both Neil and Landon started laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, they didn't notice that Tom's face had already gone pale with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, "Who is this guy? How did he guess all my symptoms exactly?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be... he really is some kind of expert?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, that's impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He's just a young man in his twenties. There's no way he could be such a powerful recluse. He must be making this up, just lucky to guess right!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Tom managed to suppress the shock inside him. He looked at Marcus coldly and said, "Everything you've said is nonsense. I don't have the symptoms you mentioned. Someone, throw this guy out immediately before he ruins my ritual!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Tom finished speaking, Neil clapped his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few bodyguards who had been standing near the bedroom door rushed in, surrounding Marcus and trying to throw him out of the room!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cough... cough..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Bowden, lying in bed, suddenly broke into a violent coughing fit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His weary eyes snapped open, and his pupils revealed intense pain. Blood poured from his mouth as he collapsed back onto the bed, his breathing completely stopping. His eyes remained open, lifeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad!" "Grandpa!" "What's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, the Thurman family rushed to his side. Melina's eyes welled up with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never expected her grandfather's condition to take such a sudden, drastic turn for the worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Zack! What happened to my father? Please, save him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Davey, his face filled with urgency, begged Tom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom's expression became serious as he moved to the bed, feeling Bowden's pulse. He then pointed an angry finger at Marcus. "It's because of this man that my ritual was disturbed, and your father's condition worsened. I told you all to throw him out, but you didn't listen. Now it's too late. Your father is beyond saving!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At these words, the entire Thurman family turned their furious gaze on Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neil shot a look of anger at Melina. "This is your doing! You insisted on bringing this man here. If your grandfather dies, it will be all your fault!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Melina's face flushed with guilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She regretted ever inviting Marcus to Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's your fault you failed to perform the ritual properly, but now you're blaming me. You really know how to pass the buck!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes locked onto Tom's as he spoke coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, Marcus stepped forward and placed his hand on Bowden's wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Tom furrowed his brows even more and tried to push Marcus aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus didn't budge. With a mocking smile, he said, "If you don't have the ability to treat Sir Thurman, then step aside!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Marcus' eyes were filled with a deadly intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some reason, even Tom, who was at the Ancient Martial Stage Two level, felt a chill run through his body. He involuntarily took a step back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This startled Tom, making his face darkened with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At almost the same time, Marcus began to channel the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire. Streams of Timeless Numinous Energy flowed from his palms into Bowden's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the infusion of this energy, Bowden's complexion began to regain color, turning redder by the second visibly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than two minutes, Bowden, who had lost all signs of life and had even stopped breathing, suddenly started to breathe again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His breathing gradually grew stronger until it returned to a normal, steady rhythm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This... how is this possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom's eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rubbed his eyes vigorously, convinced he must be seeing things. But no, the impossible had happened right before his eyes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa... he's alive! Grandpa's alive... This is amazing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina's face lit up with joy, a radiant smile spreading across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neil, Davey, Kari, Landon, and Cloe stood frozen, their mouths agape. None of them could believe what they were seeing. Bowden, who had just coughed up blood and died, was now breathing again, all thanks to Marcus' treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was nothing short of miraculous!</span></p></div>
