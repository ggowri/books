  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila was just a young woman, far from home, fighting her way up in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through sheer grit and determination, she had become one of the most popular internet celebrities in the country.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her songs were everywhere, and she had released several chart-topping hits that made her an overnight sensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her achievements had already surpassed those of most people her age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as she spent time with Marcus, he began to see a different side of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She seemed more real, more down-to-earth than he'd expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her elegance, which had once felt abstract, now felt like something tangible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a cold voice cut through the moment. "Marcus! Get out here and die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus turned to the window and saw it was Edmund, the man who had clashed with </span><span>them earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was flanked by a few men from the underground world, all holding weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And there, standing smugly among them, was Tina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Edmund had lost his company, his connections were still alive and kicking. With one phone call, he had brought in members of the notorious Axe Gang, one of the most powerful criminal groups in the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund had thrown everything he had at them, his savings, his last hopes, all to take down Marcus and Lila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was determined to make them pay. If Marcus had ruined him, then Marcus had to vanish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought made Tina feel a twisted sense of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila looked out the window and saw the armed gang members. Worry flashed across her face. "Mr. Fitzgerald, I think Edmund's brought some serious trouble with him. What should we do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus wasn't fazed. He waved his hand, dismissing her concerns. "Let's go see what they want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for her response, he stood up and walked toward the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they stepped outside, they found the Axe Gang blocking the entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curious restaurant-goers began to gather around, some of them setting down their forks to watch the show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You didn't expect this, did you?" Edmund </span><span>sneered,</span><span> his eyes gleaming with malice as he watched Marcus step outside without a hint of fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You thought you were untouchable, but now you're in my hands."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Edmund had spent millions hiring the Axe Gang. He wanted nothing less than the death of Marcus and Lila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcus had taken everything from him, then he was going to make sure Marcus would pay the price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't want to get down to your level," Marcus said coldly, glancing at Edmund and Tina. "But you just keep pushing, don't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina crossed her arms and sneered. "Still acting all calm and collected? You think you can scare us with that poker face? Well, it's not </span><span>gonna</span><span> work. You're as good as dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund waved her off, signaling for her to stay quiet. "Stop wasting time. Just sit back and enjoy the show."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Raymond Steele, a branch leader of the Axe Gang, and said, "Mr. Steele, this guy's the one who ruined me. Make sure he and that woman go straight to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond looked at Marcus for a moment, as if something about him seemed familiar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the feeling quickly passed, and he dismissed the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You paid me to do a job, and I'll do it. These two won't live to see another day," Raymond said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund's millions had been well spent. He would make sure to get his money's worth, and then some, when the job was done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, boys, get them!" Raymond barked the order, and the gang members surged forward, closing in on Marcus and Lila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila, panic rising in her chest, grabbed Marcus' arm. "Mr. Fitzgerald, we should call </span><span>the police! These people don't hesitate to kill. I'm really scared they'll hurt you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave her a reassuring look and gently shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, addressing Raymond, he asked, "I thought the Axe Gang had strict protocols before taking a job. Who sent you guys?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond's eyes narrowed. He hadn't expected Marcus to know about the gang's screening process. It made him pause for a brief moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina sneered, her voice dripping with disdain. "Who do you think you are, questioning Mr. Steele? Just shut up and die already. No amount of money or power will save you now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund also laughed. "He's just stalling, pretending like he's some big shot. He thinks by acting calm, he'll intimidate Mr. Steele. It's pathetic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Raymond again and said with a cruel smile, "Mr. Steele, don't waste time on him. Just finish him off."</span></p><div class="pagination">
