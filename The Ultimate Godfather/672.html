  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, he almost exploded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if she felt the time was almost right, Diana stood up and started her next movement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana let out a high-pitched cry, and her body instantly felt filled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus' firm part was too hard, and Diana felt a strong sense of expansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As her body moved up and down, the sense grew stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What followed was an indescribable sensation of intense stimulation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each repeated movement, Diana was continuously stimulated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rich sensitivity of her nerves, a fleeting touch, caused Diana to completely lose control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The liquid flowed down between his legs, soaking Marcus' body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't bear it any longer. He held Diana's buttocks with both hands and began to move hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah... oh... oh... so comfortable, Mr. Fitzgerald. I feel like my whole body is filled!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana moaned, and her breasts swayed as her body moved up and down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It gave a strong visual impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't help but hold them up, constantly touching the sensitive parts of the breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Diana cry in pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, at a certain moment, she reached her second climax.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was enveloped by a wave of overwhelming happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strong contraction in her body made Marcus can't bear it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He directly pressed Diana under him and continued in a new position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also carried Diana's legs on his shoulders so that he could reach deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every move made Diana feel like she was extremely happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the help of the power of Dual Cultivation, their sense of happiness instantly doubled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it wasn't their first time cultivating together, Diana's level of cultivation was still high enough to bring immense benefits to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On top of that, the previous Dual Cultivation with Natalie had unexpectedly allowed him to break through in an instant, reaching the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Eight. He was now only one step away from the Ancient Martial Stage Nine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden breakthrough brought Diana an indescribable sense of pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She only felt as though her entire being had been completely filled, with waves of overwhelming happiness crashing over her one after another, continuously surging through her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It quickly brought her to yet another climax!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the added power of Dual Cultivation, as Diana reached another climax, her cultivation finally broke through, reaching the peak of the Level Nine Demon Fighter, just one step away from breaking into an entirely new level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This brought her an unprecedented sense of exhilaration, and she felt as though she had forgotten everything, fully immersed in the sensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, your Dual Cultivation is incredible. Both of us actually broke through at the same time!" Anna couldn't help but say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you need to practice Dual Cultivation more often in the future so that you can make progress," Marcus replied with a mischievous grin. Before Diana could respond, he launched into another intense assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, after a flurry of intense movements, his body reached its peak, completely exhausted, with no strength left. He was entirely immersed in the blissful sensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's body was shaking, and her mind was blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She only felt a surge of warmth flowing in, one that didn't seem to belong to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She subconsciously looked up and saw Marcus' comfortable expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, you are so bad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana glared at Marcus fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but wonder if Marcus had done something similar with other girls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't matter to her. She could forcefully expel it from her body using her cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if Marcus had done the same with other girls, they would truly be in trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was just an uncontrollable impulse. Don't take it to heart," Marcus said, scratching his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was fully immersed in the endless pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the cultivation breakthrough, he felt that his strength had made significant progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only him, but Diana also felt the same way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was now even more eager to see what the next level would bring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's face flushed when she looked at the wet spot on the bed. She put on a bath towel and went to the bathroom to wash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus forced his way in, giving Diana a big fright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, what are you doing? I'll just take a shower and be back soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't it nice for me to take a bath together with you?" Marcus chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had no choice but to bathe with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this time, Marcus naturally didn't stay idle. His big hands touched Diana's sensitive parts intentionally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made her feel distracted again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After enduring until the bath was over, they finally lay down together on the bed, letting out a long sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, Mr. Fitzgerald, your cultivation has reached the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Eight. It's time to go look for the Return Essence Crystal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana seemed to have remembered something and said to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the Return Essence Crystal, and what does it do?" Marcus asked as if he was hearing this for the first time.</span></p><div class="pagination">
