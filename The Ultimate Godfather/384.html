        <h1>Chapter 383 I Just Need to Hit You</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oliver, you finally showed up! If you hadn't come, that guy would've beaten me to death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Randy immediately stepped forward, his face full of distress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing his cousin beaten like this, Oliver, the Battle God, furrowed his brows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though he was a police officer and shouldn't get involved in personal fights, his cousin had grown up under his watch, and anger quickly ignited within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tell me, did you provoke him first?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Randy replied, "I just came to see Grace and got into a verbal spat with that guy. He beat me up like this, Oliver. I didn't start anything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Upon hearing this, Oliver clenched his fists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since his cousin hadn't provoked the trouble, he had to handle this situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked in the direction Randy was pointing and immediately spotted Marcus lounging casually on a public bench by the street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Marcus was half-lying on the bench, a cigarette hanging from his mouth, legs crossed, looking completely relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oliver, look at how arrogant he is. He knew you were coming and acted like nothing was wrong. You have to punish him harshly, lock him up in the station and interrogate him for at least ten days!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Randy spoke fiercely, eager to beat Marcus severely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Slap!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But as soon as Randy finished, Oliver slapped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone froze, confused as to why Oliver was hitting Randy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They wondered if they wouldn't be punishing the arrogant guy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They wondered what was happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Randy was nearly knocked to the ground, looking at Oliver in confusion. "Oliver, why did you hit me? Did you hit the wrong person? You should've hit that damn guy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I just need to hit you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With those words, Oliver slapped Randy again, furiously saying, "You still claim you didn't start anything. Listen carefully. This is Mr. Death, someone I must respect. Do you think someone with Mr. Death's status would provoke someone like you, a playboy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this, everyone present was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They couldn't believe what they were hearing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mr. Death?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They seemed to have never heard of this title.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More importantly, Oliver actually said that this young man was someone he had to respect, which was unbelievable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Battle God Oliver, Uswad's youngest general, had slain countless enemies on the battlefield and earned great honors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was known as the Battle God of Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such a figure was a totem in Uswad's military and police circles, and even some higher-ups couldn't stop praising Oliver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Oliver was now slapping his own cousin in public because of this young man, completely overturning everyone's understanding!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Randy's expression completely darkened. He felt like he was dreaming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A few rich second-generation guys next to him were also dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, under everyone's gaze, Oliver and a few special police officers walked over to Marcus and bowed to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Nice to meet you, Mr. Death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those words echoed through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It made them tremble as if struck by lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They all started speculating about Marcus' identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Facing the bows from Oliver and his team, Marcus didn't stand up. He remained seated, waved his hand, and said, "We fought side by side in the trenches. There's no need for this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Upon hearing this, Oliver and the others straightened up. Marcus looked at Oliver and asked, "Have your injuries healed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver replied, "I bandaged them up yesterday, but a full recovery might take some time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus reached into his Spatial Ring and took out a pill, tossing it into Oliver's hand. "Take this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver was momentarily stunned but did as Marcus instructed, swallowing the pill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A warm sensation slid down his throat and into his stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Within seconds, Oliver felt a powerful energy spreading through his body, instantly affecting his several wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Almost immediately, he saw his injuries begin to heal at a visible speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In less than ten seconds, he was completely healed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This... How is this possible? What kind of medicine is this with such amazing effects?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver widened his eyes. He had fought countless battles and had never seen a miracle drug like this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Death, for the medicine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver bowed deeply to Marcus again, and Marcus' image in his mind grew even more impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus waved dismissively and glanced at Randy, who was still standing stunned nearby. "Your cousin is too reckless. He needs proper discipline when you get back."</span></p></div>
