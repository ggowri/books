        <h1>Chapter 1002 The New Path of Conquest-5</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since all energy crystal mines are controlled by the Atrandis Empire, the energy crystals they obtain are of very high quality.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A modified gun is almost equivalent to the power of an Ancient Martial Stage Nine expert.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this way, when an ordinary soldier gets a gun, theoretically, he can possess the terrifying attack power of an Ancient Martial Stage Nine expert.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The entire Atrandis Empire has tens of millions of soldiers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When everyone is equipped with such guns, they are equivalent to an army of tens of millions of Ancient Martial Stage Nine experts!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Additionally, Marcus also recruited numerous beastmasters to raise magical beasts, enhancing the overall strength of the Atrandis Empire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After years of effort, the Atrandis Empire has been transformed by him into a truly indestructible fortress, even capable of expansion, striking fear into its enemies!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Marcus did not allow his subordinates to invade any continent beyond the Ice Wall.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On this day, within the palace of the Atrandis Empire, the sky darkened, and fierce winds swept through. A supremely powerful aura descended from the heavens.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The beam of light pierced straight into the clouds, seemingly connecting heaven and earth, dazzling beyond compare.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus sat on a seat inside the palace, bathed in the beam of light.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the aid of several top-tier pills, he was breaking through to a state beyond Innate State, the Martial Exalted Realm!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was the state Ryan had pursued his entire life but failed to break through.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In just five years of cultivation, Marcus transformed from an ordinary person into a Martial Exalted Realm expert. His talent for cultivation was astonishing. This was unprecedented!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, this was also thanks to the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire he cultivated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This type of cultivation manual not only allows Dual Cultivation but is also all-encompassing. Especially in terms of cultivation speed, it's far more effective than any magical cultivation manual commonly found on the market.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was precisely the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire that made Marcus who he is today.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He remembered the old man who once gave him the pendant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That old man was the one who changed his destiny. Marcus missed him deeply and longed to see him again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once, Marcus spent a lot of time searching for clues.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But as his cultivation and state grew, he realized that someone who could casually give him a pendant containing such powerful cultivation manuals couldn't be an ordinary person.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That old man's state might have already surpassed the level of this world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>According to the logic in some web novels, such people are likely already immortals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The world they live in is called fairyland.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Marcus's cultivation and state reached that level, he had almost no chance to see that old man again, unless that old man took the initiative to find him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This breakthrough, though quite slow, was also very smooth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Several hours later, Marcus's cultivation reached the Martial Exalted Realm!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His strength made another qualitative leap, countless times stronger compared to his previous Innate State.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus took a few days to stabilize his state.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, he knew the time had come.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was time for him to head to Atrandis Continent and reclaim what belonged to Ryan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, in the following days, Marcus didn't continue cultivating but spent time with his family and women.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They enjoyed delicious food together, went out to have fun, and cherished the rare peaceful moments.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Half a month later, Marcus informed everyone about his upcoming journey to Atrandis Continent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although they were reluctant, they all supported his decision.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Ryan's son, Marcus naturally had to honor Ryan's dying wishes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What's more, having inherited Ryan's position, he was even more obliged to fulfill his wishes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thus, on this day, Marcus, escorted by his women and family, arrived at Morvalis's Ice Wall.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maxine's eyes were filled with tears. She gently touched her already swollen belly and said reluctantly, "Marcus, you must come back soon. We're all waiting for you at home!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In her belly was Marcus's child.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He kissed her forehead tenderly and promised, "Don't worry. I will definitely come back. Once I completely conquer the Atrandis Continent, I'll bring all of you there to live."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus, you must keep your word. We're all waiting for you here. Don't you dare lie to us!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Natalia also walked over. Over the years, she had grown much more mature, yet she was still incredibly beautiful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus pulled her into his arms, gently stroking her hair, and said, "Of course. I won't lie to you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My dear, remember to write to us often when you get there. We'll all miss you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane and Josie also walked over, their eyes filled with tears.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus comforted them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne, Michelle, Grace, Natalie, and the other girls also looked reluctant, holding back their tears.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at the thought of parting with Marcus, they couldn't help but sob softly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Richard said, "Marcus, don't worry. Your mom, Nicole, and I will always support you. I know you're outstanding and will surely fulfill Godfather's last wish in the future."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although he was only Marcus's foster father, he always treated Marcus as his own son.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus said, "Dad, I got it. Don't worry. You and Mom take good care of yourselves. And you, Nicole, you're not young anymore. Hurry up and find a boyfriend. I want to be an uncle."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, his gaze fell on Nicole again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, she had already graduated from college and was a beauty.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Marcus became the king of the Atrandis Empire, Nicole naturally became a princess, admired and revered by all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, her pretty face blushed. She said, "Marcus, stop worrying about me. I definitely won't let you down. When you come back, you'll have a nephew!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He laughed and said, "Alright, I&rsquo;ll remember that."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus's gaze swept over the family and women before him, those who shared passion and hardships with him day and night.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though reluctant, he knew a greater mission awaited him, and he had to give it his all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hugging each of them one by one, he took Diana, Alison, Ada, and Gertie with him into the space-time gate of Morvalis's Ice Wall.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The reason was simple. These four women were the strongest among those around him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they stayed within the world of the Ice Wall, it might hinder their personal growth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus brought them to the Atrandis Continent to broaden their horizons and help them grow quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Ice Wall's space-time gate shone brightly. The power of time and space enveloped their five bodies. Then, they vanished from everyone's sight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus thus embarked on a new path of conquest. He was destined to forge a brilliant life!</span></p></div>
