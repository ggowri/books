        <h1>Chapter 983 One Shot to the Head-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hubby, that's the man who hit me! You must teach him a lesson, best if you break all his limbs so he spends the rest of his life bedridden!" Faith said through gritted teeth, pointing toward Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aidan's gaze shifted to Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was just a small-time thug in the area, known for his ruthless and reckless nature, gradually gaining recognition and gathering dozens of followers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he hadn't joined major gangs like Serpent's Coil, so he had no impression of Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Marcus so young, a cold glint flashed in Aidan's eyes. But when he noticed Morgana beside Marcus, his gaze suddenly turned greedy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this your stepdaughter?" Aidan asked casually.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Faith nodded in response.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She's really pretty. Beautiful face, hot body, especially that chest, even bigger than yours..." Aidan shamelessly looked Morgana up and down, his face full of desire as he spoke.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Aidan praise Morgana, Faith frowned slightly but quickly relaxed. "You have good taste! She does look great. If you like her, once we take care of this man, she's yours!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Faith understood men well. She knew she was aging and it was hard to keep Aidan's heart. Clearly, Aidan had taken an interest in Morgana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What she wanted was just Aidan as her support. No matter how many women were around him, she shouldn't mind, as long as he didn't abandon her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To make sure Aidan wouldn't abandon her, she had to understand his preferences. Since Aidan was lustful, she would satisfy his desires.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As expected, Faith's words made Aidan beam with joy. He reached out and patted Faith's plump butt, saying, "You really get me! I'll deal with this guy right now, and tonight I'll sleep with your stepdaughter. I must taste her!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before he finished speaking, Aidan coldly stared at Marcus, his tone instantly turning icy. "You must regret it now, don't you? Regret provoking me, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Considering you're still young, I won't kill you, but I'll cut off your limbs. Tonight, you'll stay in my room and watch as I play with your woman, making her unable to resist."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as he said this, the people around Aidan also burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They all knew Aidan had this fetish&mdash;he not only liked mature women but also had a thing for other men's women, especially enjoying being with them right in front of their men.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This young man offending Aidan is truly his misfortune.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, facing Aidan's aggression, Marcus remained calm and uttered a cold remark, "You probably won't get the chance."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aidan was stunned for a moment, then quickly reacted, his face full of mockery. "What nonsense are you talking about? I'm telling you, you won't escape today!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before he finished speaking, he waved to the people beside him, signaling them to take action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those men gripped their machetes tightly and surrounded Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A green-haired man, seemingly eager to take credit, stepped forward first, raised his machete, and snarled, "You're really asking for it, daring to act so arrogant in front of Aidan. Today, I'll chop off one of your arms first!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, he swung the machete fiercely toward Marcus's shoulder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, just as the machete was about to fall, a crisp gunshot pierced through the air.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was startled. Looking closely, the green-haired man froze in place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A blood hole appeared in his forehead, and his body fell straight to the ground.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hiss..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Witnessing this scene, everyone gasped and turned their eyes toward the direction of the gunshot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A group of people strode over, numbering in the hundreds, each holding standard firearms.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The leader was none other than Serpent's Coil's hall master, Jalen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Due to Serpent's Coil's recent strong rise in Solomia, Jalen's name had already become famous in the underworld, and even ordinary people had heard of him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, seeing Jalen personally leading people to the scene, many were stunned, unsure of how this matter was related to Serpent's Coil or why he had come here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aidan and Faith's faces instantly turned pale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Especially Aidan, his body even started trembling slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although he wasn't qualified to join Serpent's Coil, he knew Jalen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Zafer, what brings you here?" Aidan asked, trying to appear calm, but his tone betrayed a hint of panic.</span></p></div>
