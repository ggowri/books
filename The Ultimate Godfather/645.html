        <h1>Chapter 644 Standing up for Chad</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's really you, huh? What happened to you, man?" Marcus slapped Chad on the back with a laugh, his voice full of teasing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in school, Chad had been the life of the class, always cracking jokes and bringing energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, though, he looked like he'd aged ten years, his face etched with weariness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chad scratched his head, a nervous smile playing on his lips. "I'll explain later. Let me just handle this mess first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned back to the woman, bending down as if he were about to lick the soles of her shoes. It seemed like the only way to get out of the 200 thousand dollars she was demanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chad, wait a second!" Marcus blocked him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chad looked up in surprise. "I hit her luxury car, and she's demanding 200 grand. I don't have that kind of money, so this is the only way. It's no big deal. I'm not afraid of getting dirty. Just a quick brush of my teeth later and I'll be fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus could see the frustration and helplessness in Chad's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's the one at fault, not you," Marcus said firmly. "She should be paying you, not the other way around." He stepped between them, blocking Chad from going any further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman noticed Marcus and narrowed her eyes. "What, you want to help him lick my shoes?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She eyed him up and down with a sly smirk. "You're not bad-looking, better than this loser. Maybe you could lick my shoes. Wouldn't be such a bad idea, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shifted her shoe towards him, her arrogance on full display.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus remained calm, his voice cold. "You heard what we said earlier. You're fully responsible for the accident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You owe my friend. Twenty thousand for the bike, 30 thousand for medical bills, and let's throw in some for lost wages and mental distress. Two hundred thousand dollars. Hand it over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He extended his hand, staring her down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd around them gasped. No one expected this young guy to turn around and demand money from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chad's face turned pale. He grabbed Marcus' arm, whispering frantically, "Marcus, stop. I know you're trying to help, but this woman is dangerous. We can't afford to mess with her. Just let me do what she asks and move on, okay? I can't waste any more time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus shook his head, his expression hardening. "She only acts like this because she knows she can push people around. Don't worry. I've got this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't stand bullies, especially when they were picking on an old friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said, give me the money. Now." His voice was steely, unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman blinked in disbelief. "What? You want me to pay him? Two hundred grand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yep," Marcus said, his tone sharp. "You have one minute to transfer it. After that, forget about leaving here today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman raised an eyebrow and then burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kid, you've lost your mind. You want me to pay? Do you even know who I am? The police can't even touch me. And you? You think you can make me pay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't flinch. He suddenly remembered something and said, "Oh, right. You slapped my friend earlier. I almost forgot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled, a dangerous glint in his eyes. "That slap just added another two million to your tab. If you don't pay up in one minute, it'll go up to five million. You've got one minute. Make it count."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman's face twisted with disbelief. "You're out of your mind, kid. You really think you can threaten me? Today, I'm not paying a dime. You'll see what happens when you mess with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was stunned, witnessing Marcus escalate the situation even further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus stepped forward, his voice cold as ice. "You don't have to pay, but you'll have to deal with the consequences."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could react, he was right in front of her, grabbing her by the collar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman's face shifted from arrogance to fear as she sputtered, "What do you think you're doing, country bumpkin? You want to fight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could say anything more, Marcus slapped her across the face, the sound echoing through the air. Blood poured from her nose and mouth as she screamed in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's for my friend," Marcus said, his voice calm, almost detached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his hand and delivered another slap, the force sending her stumbling back, her face swelling instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She struggled, fury and pain in her eyes. "You bastard! You think you can hit me and get away with it? I'll make sure you regret this!"</span></p></div>
