  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie's sense of gratitude once again earned Marcus's respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He accepted the proposal she handed over and read through it carefully. It was clear that her plan was not only cost-efficient but also excelled in both production efficiency and technical craftsmanship, matching the performance of a full premium setup&mdash;all while saving on expenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Returning the document to her, Marcus nodded in approval and said, "I'm very satisfied with your proposal, Ms. Shelman. Let's proceed with this plan. The key is whether it can be completed within three months."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie pondered for a moment before asking, "Is it that urgent, Mr. Fitzgerald?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to BioFusion Pharmaceuticals' skyrocketing success, their order volume had surged, significantly increasing production pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Completing everything in three months was a daunting task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," Marcus replied. "The factory in Solomia will be ready in three months. I want to synchronize production to capture the market."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Josie's expression turned resolute. "If that's the case, I'll do everything I can. The production line currently runs for sixteen hours a day, but I'll offer double wages to the workers to keep it running 24/7. I'll ensure that your production line is delivered on time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you so much, Ms. Shelman," Marcus said with a satisfied smile. "As for the payment, there's no need to give me any discounts. Let's settle on 7.5 billion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he only offered five billion, Josie might not incur a loss, but she certainly wouldn't earn much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus wasn't one to exploit others for free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie was about to decline his generosity, but Marcus interrupted her. "No need to argue, Ms. Shelman. If you don't agree, I'll take my business elsewhere."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gazed at him deeply, and Marcus' image rose even higher in her esteem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a pained expression crossed Josie's delicate face. Her rosy cheeks turned pale, and she clutched her abdomen, clearly struggling to hold herself together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Shelman, are you okay?" Marcus asked with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's nothing... just an old issue. Mr. Fitzgerald, you can visit the office tomorrow morning to select materials for the production line. If there's nothing else, I'll take my leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie tried to stand, seemingly eager to avoid showing her discomfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as soon as she rose, a wave of dizziness overcame her. If not for Marcus catching her, she would have collapsed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Shelman, you seem to be in a lot of pain. Don't push yourself. Rest here for a while, and leave once you feel better," Marcus suggested, handing her a glass of warm water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It'll only get worse..." Josie murmured weakly. "Do you happen to have any ibuprofen? That should help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ibuprofen? For pain relief?" Marcus asked, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie nodded, her face tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My family has practiced traditional healing for generations. If you don't mind, I can help alleviate the pain," Marcus offered after observing her discomfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A blush crept across Josie's face. After hesitating briefly, she bit her lip and confessed. "It's menstrual cramps... A dose of ibuprofen usually helps."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus froze for a moment, taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had assumed it was a serious illness, only to find out it was cramps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Modern women often experienced health issues due to stress and irregular lifestyles, and menstrual pain was not uncommon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus recalled Michelle, who didn't have cramps but did suffer from irregular cycles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he wasn't a woman, Marcus understood how debilitating menstrual pain could be. He'd even heard of severe cases leading to fainting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judging by Josie's expression, hers must be one of those severe cases.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're open to it, I can help relieve the pain," Marcus offered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie's cheeks flushed, but she nodded. "I'd appreciate it, Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gestured for her to remove her jacket. "To help effectively, you'll need to expose your abdomen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie hesitated briefly before taking off her blazer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being in her thirties, she had a slim and graceful figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her breasts were round and perky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given Marcus's keen eye, it was clear that her breast had not been artificially enhanced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her breasts were entirely natural, a testament to Josie's exceptional beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't help but admire her natural beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, sensing his gaze linger, Josie frowned slightly and reminded him, "Mr. Fitzgerald, shall we proceed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Snapping out of his thoughts, Marcus focused on her exposed abdomen. It was flat and toned, without a trace of excess fat or the marks of childbirth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Josie's lower abdomen was mostly covered by her pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To ensure proper access, Marcus gently tried to adjust her waistband lower, only for Josie to slap his hand away. "Mr. Fitzgerald, what are you doing?" she exclaimed.</span></p><div class="pagination">
