She never imagined it would end like this, even in her dreams.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She clearly knew that Rivers was an Acquired State Seven expert.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His combat power was almost equivalent to an Ancient Martial Stage Nine expert.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But even so, he couldn't withstand even three moves </span><span>from</span><span> Marcus!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, Gertie could tell that Marcus had the ability to kill the opponent within the first two moves.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The reason he kept dodging was merely to toy with Rivers!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In other words, Marcus now possesses the strength to instantly kill an Acquired State Nine expert.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His strength is simply overwhelming!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie even believed that even if the nine ancestors of her family attacked together, they might not be a match for Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More importantly, Marcus </span><span>killed</span><span> Rivers </span><span>with the</span><span> extremely terrifying Devouring Power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A Devouring Power that can instantly drain a person into a dried corpse!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Gertie had heard before that some people had mastered this evil power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But those people, when using such evil power, not only had to pay a price but also couldn&rsquo;t wield it as effortlessly as Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They usually need to burn their own essence blood and might even suffer backlash!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus, however, could effortlessly perform such cultivation manuals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even someone as powerful as Rivers still couldn&rsquo;t escape the fate of being drained into a dried corpse by Marcus!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie wondered if she was imagining things.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After </span><span>Marcus </span><span>absorb</span><span>ed</span><span> Rivers' energy, she felt that </span><span>his</span><span> aura seemed to have changed, becoming even stronger than before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, just as Gertie had guessed, after obtaining Rivers' energy</span><span>, </span><span>Marcus's cultivation skyrocketed instantly, rising from Acquired State Six to Acquired State Seven. His combat power surged significantly once again!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is he... dead?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie tiptoed up to Marcus, unable to look him in the eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, I said I'd kill him within three moves, so I naturally wouldn't waste time on him," Marcus nodded and said with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling the changes in his cultivation, he was pleasantly surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus, can you tell me what cultivation manuals you just used? Why are they so powerful?" Gertie asked curiously, blinking her bright, sparkling eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unknowingly, she seemed to be filled with admiration for the man in front of her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's a type of devouring cultivation manual, absorbing others' energy to enhance my own cultivation," Marcus replied calmly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie's eyes lit up, and she exclaimed, "So powerful!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She</span><span> was not wrong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After devouring Rivers' cultivation, Marcus </span><span>i</span><span>ndeed improved</span><span> his own</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course, I'm strong. You should know that well, especially in bed. Am I not strong?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus gave Gertie a meaningful look.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're so annoying..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie instantly understood </span><span>what </span><span>Marcus</span><span> meant</span><span>, and her face turned red at that moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go save those girls quickly." Marcus said with a smile, looking at Gertie's blushing cheeks.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie nodded gently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, the two of them headed deeper into the cave together.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After killing Rivers, there were still many Ophidians guarding the cave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But their skill levels were not high, only at Acquired State Two or Acquired State Three.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For Marcus, they posed no threat at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus casually unleashed attacks and killed them all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As expected, the girls were imprisoned in the deepest cage of the cave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were hundreds of girls, none older than 25.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some were even younger, looking only sixteen or seventeen, and each of them was very beautiful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Apart from the girls imprisoned in the cages, human organs and the corpses of young girls </span><span>were also scattered </span><span>on the ground.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These people were likely killed by those Ophidian</span><span>s</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Marcus and Gertie, the girls, as if seeing their saviors, began shouting even louder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Help... help us... please save us, we're about to be killed by those monsters!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing the</span><span>se</span><span> pitiful girls, Gertie felt heartbroken. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She quickly said, "Don't worry, we're here to save you. Those Ophidian</span><span>s</span><span> are all dead, you don't need to be afraid."</span></p><div class="pagination">
