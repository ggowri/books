  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia naturally agreed and made up her mind to practice magic well so Marcus wouldn't have to worry about her anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the Griffin Villa in Crankhurst, Terry, Zane, Easton, and several other high-ranking members of the Griffin family were present. When they heard the news that Isaac had been crippled, their hearts were filled with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zane, in particular, was furious because Isaac was his son. To have him crippled in Uswad was something he couldn't bear. When they saw the picture of the culprit, the entire family's expression turned cold, especially Easton, whose eyes burned with hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This damn Uswadian person again! He killed my teacher before, and now he's ruined Isaac. Dad, we can't let him go." Easton gritted his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terry's gaze was grim as he replied calmly, "We'll have to call in Black Dragon Society for this one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the words left his mouth, the faces of the Griffin family members showed respect. Black Dragon Society was the most powerful ninja organization in Crankhurst, its strength beyond the imagination of most. If they sent someone after the bastard from Uswad, his days would be numbered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, what they didn't know was that Black Dragon Society had already attempted Marcus' life. They had sent two level-5 ninjas, both of whom had been killed by Marcus. Now, Black Dragon Society's leader was enraged and had ordered the dispatch of even more experts to Uswad to kill the murderer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Terry could leave the Griffin villa, a figure suddenly appeared in the room. "No need for all that trouble. I'm here," A cold voice echoed through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Griffin family members froze. The figure that appeared out of nowhere was none other than Marcus. They were dumbfounded. Never in their wildest dreams had they thought Marcus would show up at their family's estate. They thought, "What kind of magic is this? It's even more impressive than Crankhurst's ninja techniques."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want?" Terry asked warily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wasn't it you who were planning to kill me?" Marcus sneered, "Well, here I am. Go ahead and make your move."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dropping Natalia back at Kingston University, Marcus used teleportation to arrive at the Griffin Villa in Crankhurst. He had a feeling that after hearing about Isaac, the family would make their move against him, and that posed a risk. It was better to eliminate the threat directly, so he had come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think our family is that weak?" Terry growled, seeing Marcus' arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he swiftly waved his hand, and immediately, a group of armed men appeared around the cabin, each holding a gun. The dark barrels of the guns were all aimed at Marcus, trying to kill him on the spot. "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fire!" With Terry's command, the armed men immediately pulled their triggers, and bullets rained down on Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sneered and activated Shadow Step, moving quickly through the hail of bullets. At the same time, he reached out and summoned a small sub-machine gun embedded with an energy crystal into his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus pulled the trigger, the gun released terrifying energy beams, tearing through the armed men outside the cabin. Booms echoed, shaking the entire Griffin Villa, followed by the screams of the attackers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just moments, the Griffin family's armed men were utterly helpless. Their bodies were blasted apart, and the ground was littered with limbs, and blood flowed in rivers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... what kind of gun is that? It's so powerful," Zane stammered in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gun Marcus held was unlike anything he had ever seen. It didn't shoot bullets but rather beams of energy, far more powerful than regular bullets&mdash;like a mini mortar shell. The area where the beam struck exploded violently, leaving a scene of carnage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than two minutes, dozens of armed assassins were dead at Marcus' hands. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Terry pulled out a remote control and pressed a button. Above Marcus' position, a heavy iron cage suddenly dropped down from the ceiling, attempting to trap him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terry thought this move would trap Marcus, but he didn't realize that, after Marcus' breakthrough in cultivation, his reaction speed was over a hundred times that of a normal person. This move was no threat at all. With a simple flash, Marcus avoided the trap effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, several assassins threw grenades toward Marcus, but he shot them all down with his sub-machine gun. At this point, nearly all of the Griffin family's assassins had been wiped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terry, Zane, Easton, and several other high-ranking members of the family were left stunned, watching the terrifying scene unfold. They had never imagined that Marcus would be so powerful in combat.</span></p><div class="pagination">
