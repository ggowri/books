  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene left everyone around utterly stunned. No one had expected this young man to be such a skilled fighter. Luke, the head of campus security, looked livid. Without hesitation, he began dialing the police.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could complete the call, Patrick staggered to his feet and barked, "Luke, no need for you to handle this. He attacked me and Isaac, so my family will deal with him personally."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Luke shifted his expression and nodded lightly. He thought, "With the powerful Kingston Whitman family involved, this young man's fate will undoubtedly be grim."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick turned his gaze to Marcus and sneered, "Do you dare wait here? Let's see how cocky you are once my family arrives." The crowd murmured, and their curiosity was piqued. All eyes were on Marcus, wondering if he would actually stay and face Patrick's challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia tugged on Marcus' sleeve and whispered urgently, "Marcus, this guy is from the Whitman family in Kingston. They're one of the four great families in Uswad. I think we should leave right now. It's best not to get into a conflict with them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave her a reassuring glance, and his eyes gleamed with confidence. "Don't worry. If they dare come, it will mark the Whitman family's day of destruction." To everyone's shock, Marcus chose to stay put, waiting calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone gasped, "This guy's seriously full of himself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone echoed, "Yeah, let him wait. Once the Whitman family arrives, he'll be crying soon enough." Many people were whispering to each other and ready to see Marcus' downfall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick smirked as he pulled out his phone and dialed a number, "Hey, Landon. It's me. I got attacked at Kingston University. The guy's insanely arrogant&mdash;he even said he'd wipe out the entire Whitman family. You've got to come and teach him a lesson. Okay, I will wait for you here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up, Patrick shot Marcus a smug look and said, "You're so bold, huh? I've just called Landon. When he arrives, it'll be the end of the road for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, a wave of shock rippled through the crowd. Even though Patrick hadn't explicitly mentioned his name, everyone quickly pieced it together from his words. Landon was the current young master of the Whitman family in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone said, "This guy's doomed. Patrick actually called Landon. Let's see how he talks his way out of this one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone sighed, "Exactly. Landon's known for being ruthless. That guy's as good as dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone followed. "When Landon arrives, he might execute this guy right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing Patrick's call, whispers spread through the crowd. Many cast pitying glances at Marcus, and their eyes were filled with a mixture of sympathy and dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick turned back to Marcus, sneering, "If you've got guts, stay here until Landon arrives. Let's see if you're still this arrogant then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' gaze turned sharp as he asked nonchalantly, "Are you talking about Landon?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick puffed out his chest with pride. "So, do you know his name? Then get on your knees and beg for mercy. If you break both your arms yourself, I might just let you live."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled coldly, "We'll see about that." Just yesterday, Marcus had met Landon at the Thurman Villa. If it weren't for Landon's father, Valentin, showing genuine remorse, Landon would already be dead. To think they'd cross paths again so soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luke, meanwhile, stood off to the side with a smug expression, clearly enjoying the thought of Landon putting Marcus in his place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't take long. A convoy of luxury cars rolled onto Kingston University's campus, quickly coming to a stop near the girls' dormitory. Amidst the crowd, Landon stepped out of a Rolls-Royce Phantom, flanked by members of the Whitman family. His imposing aura sent a wave of awe through the onlookers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gasps rippled through the crowd, especially from the female students, many of whom were mesmerized by Landon's commanding presence and striking looks. Someone said, "He's here. Landon's finally here. This guy's arrogance is about to meet its end."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Escorted by his entourage, Landon strode confidently into the crowd. As the Whitman family heir, his influence in Kingston was immense. Even Luke, the head of security, hurried to greet him. Landon merely waved Luke off and continued toward Patrick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're finally here," Patrick exclaimed, and his face lighted up with excitement. He was ready to watch Marcus be utterly humiliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who attacked you?" Landon asked, and his voice was calm but carrying an unmistakable authority. A sharp eye might notice that his hand was wrapped in a bandage, hinting at a recent injury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick pointed at Marcus, and his expression was filled with venom. "It's that guy. He beat me up and even claimed he'd wipe out the entire Whitman family. You absolutely can't let him get away with this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Landon's brows furrowed as he followed Patrick's finger. His gaze landed on Marcus. But the moment he recognized Marcus, his expression froze. He stood motionless, and his mind clearly reeled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why aren't you making a move?" Patrick urged, confused by Landon's sudden hesitation.</span></p><div class="pagination">
