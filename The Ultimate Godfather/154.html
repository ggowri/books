        <h1>Chapter 153 The Undisputed Ruler</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the </span><span>Bloodspire</span><span> Order held an overwhelming advantage in numbers, their thousand-strong forces were composed entirely of ordinary people&mdash;no match for the power of Wizards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Serpent's Coil magic squad, consisting of nine members, unleashed their spells simultaneously. In an instant, fireballs and lightning bolts filled the air, engulfing the entire space in flames and crackling energy. While the nine members of the magic squad were considered only half-Wizards, their attacks were devastating enough to ordinary individuals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Screams, cries, and desperate pleas for mercy echoed throughout the battlefield. Dante's face twisted in horror; he had never imagined that the Serpent's Coil would suddenly field so many Wizards. Though he was a half-Warrior, his strength had long been surpassed by Jalen, a Stage One Wizard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bolt of lightning from Jalen struck Dante squarely, sending him flying and leaving a sharp, burnt smell lingering around him. Struggling to his feet, Dante cried out in disbelief, "How is this possible? Jalen, when did you become a Stage One Wizard?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dante's eyes were filled with shock, but before he could think of escaping in the chaos, Jalen appeared directly in front of him. With a swift motion, Jalen conjured a fireball that roared to life and enveloped the space in front of Dante.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair washed over Dante's face as he realized he had no chance to resist. The flames consumed him entirely, reducing him to ashes. At this, the remaining members of the </span><span>Bloodspire</span><span> Order were overcome with terror. Their leader was dead, and with him, their will to fight crumbled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jalen stood tall and unyielding, his presence shrouded in an aura of crackling lightning and searing flames. His voice rang out, cold and commanding. "Anyone else who dares to resist will meet the same fate." None of the </span><span>Bloodspire</span><span> Order dared to </span><span>continue resisting. They dropped their weapons and begged for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And so, the </span><span>Bloodspire</span><span> Order was utterly destroyed, swallowed up by the Serpent's Coil. Of the three major underground organizations in Solomia, only two remained, both now under the absolute control of Marcus. This meant that from this moment on, he was the undisputed ruler of Solomia's underworld, and everyone had no choice but to submit to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After this battle, the members of the Serpent's Coil became even more fanatical about training their magic. Their shared goal was to become someone like Jalen&mdash;someone who could take on impossible odds and claim victory for the Serpent's Coil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus was indifferent to all of this. To him, unifying Solomia's underworld was something he could achieve with a mere wave of his hand. The only reason he hadn't acted personally was to give his subordinates the chance to grow and sharpen their abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He understood that to achieve great ambitions and inherit the title of Godfather, relying solely on his own strength was far from enough. He needed to build his own power base, and nurturing the capabilities of his subordinates was a critical step in that process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Marcus was lying in bed, fresh from a bath. Under the covers, a naked Jane was eagerly pleasuring him, her lips wrapped tightly around his manhood as she worked with unrelenting enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of intense pleasure coursed through him, and he shuddered involuntarily. "You insatiable little minx," he muttered, his voice tinged with mock annoyance. Jane, far from being deterred, only intensified her efforts. Her smooth, delicate hands roamed over his body, teasing every sensitive spot they found.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Marcus' phone rang. It was Maxine calling. He gestured for Jane to stop, but she acted as if she hadn't heard him and continued her ministrations. With no other choice, he answered the call, "Yes, Officer Burnett. What's the matter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's slightly cool voice came through on the other end of the phone. "Tomorrow is the International Martial Arts Invitational. I'd like to ask for your advice on some wrestling techniques."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at the time and remembered the upcoming tournament. He asked casually, "You've got a match tomorrow?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes." Maxine nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since he had agreed to help her back at the Solomia Special Police Academy, Marcus couldn't back out now. He got up to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Babe, where are you going? Don't leave..." Jane peeked out from under the covers, pressing her ample chest against him. She even deliberately rubbed herself against his skin with her nipples.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've got something to do. Move," Marcus said as he pushed her aside and started getting dressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A trace of frustration flickered in Jane's eyes as she said, "I'll wait for you to come back... It's been so long since we... you know... I really miss it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at her soft, affectionate gaze and replied, "If I get back early, I'll call you over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Jane heard that, her face lit up, and she nodded eagerly. "I'll wait for you, then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Marcus drove his Aston Martin to a private gym. When he arrived, the place was completely empty, likely reserved by Maxine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was already there, dressed in a white martial arts uniform, her hair tied into a high ponytail that swung behind her. She looked sharp and capable, her confident </span><span>demeanor embodying the phrase grace under pressure.</span></p></div>
