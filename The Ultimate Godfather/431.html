  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana gasped as their bodies collided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus could feel the fullness of her breasts pressing against his chest, their shape slightly distorted by the impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they stood so close, their heartbeats pounded in sync.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus, what are you doing? Get off me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Trapped beneath him, Diana's heart raced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though they'd been intimate before, being this close to Marcus again made her nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I just miss you so much," Marcus grinned, stealing a kiss from her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana trembled. The moment their lips met, a familiar warmth surged through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're lying, Marcus. You have so many women, how could you possibly miss me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana batted her bright blue eyes, glaring at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew he had many lovers, but admitting that she was jealous was hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana knew her place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As his personal assistant, she was essentially his servant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ryan had assigned her to Marcus for his pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, she had no right to be jealous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, she considered it an honor to be intimate with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That doesn't mean I can't miss you," he said, sweeping her up in his arms and carrying her towards the bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus, what are you doing? I still have to clean..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana protested weakly, but gave in to his insistence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Pearl can do it later," he chuckled, closing the door behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alone together, the atmosphere grew heavy with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking about what was to come, Diana's heart pounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gently, Marcus laid her on the bed and joined her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he gazed at her flawless beauty, he kissed her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana moaned softly, her face flushed. With each passing moment, the desire within her grew stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus, why do you always think about these things?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana blushed, trying to pull away from him, but her body was weakening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She felt limp, as if all her strength had been drained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm doing my job," he replied, his voice husky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before she could protest further, he silenced her with a kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana struggled instinctively, but as his tongue parted her lips, her body went limp, surrendering to his touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus kissed her deeply while his hands explored her body, his touch sending shivers down her spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He cupped her breasts, their firmness surprising even him. Diana arched her back and whimpered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah...mm..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus, you're so naughty. Stop it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ignoring her pleas, Marcus continued his assault on her senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His hand slipped beneath her maid uniform, caressing her smooth skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He trailed his fingers over her belly until he reached the moist heat between her thighs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a gentle touch, he found the swollen bud and began to tease it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana cried out, her body convulsing. Fluid leaked from between her legs, coating his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He slipped a finger inside her, the warmth and wetness sending a thrill through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With each thrust, Diana's cries grew louder and more intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unable to contain himself any longer, Marcus pulled away and roughly tore off her maid uniform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her full breasts bounced into view, the pink areolas perfectly formed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus, you're so rough..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt a surge of embarrassment as she realized she was completely naked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She tried to cover herself, but he was too quick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leaning down, he took one of her breasts into his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana cried out, her body arching as he stimulated her. Overwhelmed by pleasure, she climaxed for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her body trembled, and she felt a warm liquid pool between her legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus wasted no time. He positioned himself above her and plunged deep inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With each thrust, Diana cried out.</span></p><div class="pagination">
