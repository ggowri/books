  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While speaking, her hands kept waving, and magic lights rained down on Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the whole space was enveloped by the terrifying destructive force.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it were someone else, it would be unbearable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus didn't care at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly released the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He merged the </span><span>Thunderfire</span><span> Power and Rune patterns into his palm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He instantly struck Alison with a destructive Hand Strike.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't hold back at all in this strike and almost used his strongest power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The terrifying Hand Strike came down like a shocking earth-shattering. With the blessing of Rune patterns and various destructive forces, the power of Hand Strike once again climbed to another level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if Alison's cultivation reached the seventh level of Demon Fighter, it was still not enough to resist Marcus' attack!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The rumbling sound of vibration continued to sound.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The beams of destruction were shattered by Marcus' Hand Strike.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The entire space was occupied by various destructive forces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In just a few seconds, all the destructive beams released by Alison were destroyed by Marcus' Hand Strike. However, the power of Marcus' Hand Strike did not decrease at all, and it came directly in front of Alison.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How is it possible? How? You just advanced to the Return Essence stage. Why are you so strong? This is absolutely impossible!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alison's expression was full of horror. She never thought that Marcus' strength would be raised to this level in just one month.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His Hand Strike already made her feel threatened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But when she wanted to release the attack interception, she felt that her body was completely restrained by an invisible force.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn't move at all in a short time!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've said before that your vision is narrow. You're just a brainless, short-sighted, pretty woman. But you didn't listen. Do you know the gap between us now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' body was suspended in the air.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't release any breath. But just standing there, he was like a top expert who could control the world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alison's face was livid. There was no longer the confidence and arrogance in her azure eyes, only horror.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, she had no ability to resist Marcus' Hand Strike. She could only watch it coming.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A terrifying shock sound resounded through the sky.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' Hand Strike hit Alison's body fiercely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alison screamed and her body was blown away. While in the air, she spat out a mouthful of blood and turned pale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' Hand Strike was too powerful. If Alison hadn't had the treasure to protect her body, it would have been enough to take her life!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But even so, Alison had basically lost her fighting power and could only let Marcus deal with her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus looked at Alison with a sneer on his face and said sarcastically, "Do you </span><span>remember the scene a month ago when you showed up with an extremely domineering attitude and showed off your power? At that time, did you ever think that a month later you would be stepped on by me and your entire life would be controlled by me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alison wiped the blood from the corner of her mouth and kept retreating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she retreated, she said, "I admit that I underestimated your strength. Since I am already defeated by you, you can do whatever you want!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alison knew that she had fallen into Marcus' hands and there would definitely be no good results.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So</span><span> she was ready to die.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus said, "You are so beautiful. It would be a pity to kill you like this."</span></p><div class="pagination">
