  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if to show off his financial power, Atlas didn't wait for Marcus to respond. He took out a card from his crocodile leather bag and tossed it toward Marcus with a look of arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "This card has one million dollars on it. If you break up with Natalie, the money is yours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looking at you, I'm guessing you're probably just a driver for some company. This is </span><span>probably your salary for ten years. I'd say it's a good deal. Hope you can appreciate this opportunity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Payne and Edwin were both shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edwin immediately pounced on the card, grabbing it as if he was afraid Marcus would take it. "This is one million dollars, Atlas. How can you just give it to this guy? This is such a waste! I'll hold onto it for you. If this guy doesn't break up with my sister, I'll break his legs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Payne turned to Edwin and said, "Look at you, making such a scene. Put the card down. After your sister marries Atlas, do you think we'll be missing one million dollars?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Consider this a reward for him. After all, he did save your mother's life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only after hearing Payne's words did Edwin reluctantly put the card on the ground, coldly saying to Marcus, "Hmph, consider it a favor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Witnessing the behavior of her father and brother, Natalie's face darkened completely. She stood up and said, "Dad, Edwin, you've gone too far!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus is not only my classmate, he's also my boyfriend, and he saved my mother's life! How can you speak to him like that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And let me tell you something. You keep saying Atlas is rich, but his money is nothing compared to Marcus'!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Natalie's words, Payne, Edwin, and even Mia looked surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Payne and Edwin couldn't help but scoff. "Natalie, are you joking? Are you saying he's richer than Atlas? That's impossible! Atlas makes tens of millions of dollars every year!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's just a driver. How could he be compared to Atlas?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I bet if you give him that one million dollars, he'd gladly break up with you. After all, that's money he'll never earn in his entire life!" Edwin mocked, clearly not believing what Natalie was saying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, Natalie, don't make excuses for this guy. I really don't understand what's so good about him that you're defending him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When girls marry, they marry for a good life, for money, for a stable future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But look at you, you just want a pretty boy. I guess I wasted all those years trying to educate you!" Payne also spoke up immediately, shaking his head in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kid, just take </span><span>this one million dollars</span><span> and get lost. There won't be a second chance. How dare you compete with me for a woman? You're not even close!" Atlas said arrogantly to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, making Marcus break up with Natalie didn't even require the one million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only reason he offered the money was to show off, to set himself up as a man who wasn't short of cash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Atlas, you really don't have to spend this much. Now I feel kind of embarrassed," Cora said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't expected Atlas to be so generous, and in her heart, she felt a bit envious of Payne's family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Cora. This is nothing to me. When Natalie and I get together, you'll </span><span>definitely benefit, too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Atlas, being a clever man, understood how to navigate relationships and show gratitude where needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Cora grinned widely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you the sales manager under Hector?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Atlas' arrogance, Marcus remained unfazed, his expression still calm as he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Atlas' eyes narrowed in surprise. "You actually know Mr. Olson? Are you perhaps a driver for our company?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief pause, Atlas continued, "You're just a poor driver, and you dare address Mr. Olson by name? How audacious!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus let out a cold laugh. He said, "How do you know I'm a driver?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Atlas sneered, "Look at you. You don't seem like a person of any status. And didn't Mrs. Vance just say your car was a company car? If you're not a driver, then what are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, kid, there's no shame in being a driver. You just can't compare to Atlas. But at least you're making money through your own efforts. My advice? Take the one million dollars and leave quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, you won't get the money, and you'll still have to break up with Natalie. It's just not worth it!" Cora advised Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I did drive the car from the company, but have you considered that the company is actually mine?" Marcus said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he said this, everyone froze for a moment, their faces filled with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they could admit that Marcus' words were technically possible, they found it impossible to believe that Marcus owned his own company.</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
