  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nevertheless, the power of Marcus' Fist Ray remained undiminished in the slightest. In the twinkling of an eye, it reached the area right in front of the guardian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guardian's face was filled with horror. It had never crossed his mind that Marcus' punch could be this terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He made an attempt to leap backwards to avoid it, yet he felt that his body was ensnared by an intangible Binding Force, rendering him completely immobile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only watch helplessly as Marcus' Fist Ray landed on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Accompanied by his despairing cry, the guardian's body was sent hurtling through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body flew backwards like a cannonball for hundreds of yards. Before falling to the ground, it exploded, shattering into fragments that rained down all over. The air was thick with a ghastly stench of blood, creating a scene of utter wretchedness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene immediately dumbfounded the other two guardians and Ada.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With one punch, Marcus effortlessly killed a guardian who was a Level Seven Curse Weaver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His strength was simply formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, judging by Marcus' demeanor, it was evident that he hadn't exerted his full might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Merely a casual punch was sufficient to overwhelm the guardian and claim his life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, a significant gulf in strength existed between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus remained calm, glanced at the other two guardians, and asked with a sneer, "Who will be the next one?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The faces of the two guardians turned deathly pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After exchanging a quick glance, they instantly reached a tacit agreement. Without uttering a single word, they simultaneously launched a fearsome assault on Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they joined forces, their combined strength was, without a doubt, far greater than that of the guardian who had been instantly slain previously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the entire space was shrouded in endless blood-red light. It seemed as if a colossal Blood Curse materialized in the sky, rapidly spreading to enshroud Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remained completely unperturbed. Waves of Runes surged forth from his body, encircling and shielding him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The extremely terrifying power of the Runes radiated outwards, as if isolating the space from the rest of the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After descending, the Blood Curse was directly blocked by the power of the Runes, accompanied by a thunderous rumble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Curse shattered into pieces, but Marcus remained composed and stood motionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene once again stunned everyone. They had never anticipated that he was actually a Rune Crafter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the way he arranged the Runes was a testament to his having achieved a level of perfection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a simple thought, the light of the Runes would cocoon him, and no form of attack would manage to break through the barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His strength was even far beyond the reach of the top-notch Rune Crafters in the world of Ancient Martial Art in Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost at the same time, Marcus roared, "Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fixed his eyes on one of the guardians and punched him casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Fist Ray appeared light, but in the eyes of the guardian, it was like a death warrant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having witnessed what had befallen his companion, he didn't dare engage Marcus in a direct confrontation. Instead, he could only make a desperate attempt to dodge as swiftly as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, an incredibly powerful Binding Force descended from the void. It was like an invisible fetter that held the guardian firmly in position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With an ashen face, he could only try to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deafening rumble of the explosion echoed out. In comparison to Marcus' Fist Ray, his counterattack was as flimsy as a piece of paper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His attacks became useless in a short time, but Marcus' fist was an unstoppable force, hurtling towards him with lightning speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, it enlarged before his eyes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, a thunderous bang resounded. Marcus' punch directly smashed the guardian's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guardian figure struggled a few more times before collapsing to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada couldn't help but gasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fight showed that in just a few days, Marcus' strength seemed to have undergone a drastic change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was much stronger than it had been a few days before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These Curse Weavers from Southvaia were just like ants in front of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He employed nothing but the most basic form of attack. Even faced with his casually launched Fist Ray, they were utterly powerless to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He completely overpowered them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this horrifying scene, the guardian, a Curse Weaver at the peak of Level Seven, didn't have the courage to </span><span>stay</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holding a yellow talisman in his hand, he attempted to crush it to make an escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus showed no mercy. The instant the talisman was crushed, his large hand shot out and seized the guardian's body. It was as easy as an eagle snatching a chick, and he held the guardian firmly in his grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, please spare my life! I'm ready to hand over all that I possess. But if you insist on taking my life, get ready to face the fury of the Bloodthirsty Cult!" the guardian pleaded, his face contorted with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he no longer had any power to fight back in Marcus' grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can go to hell now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without giving the guardian any chance to speak, Marcus just exerted the full strength of his large hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a rapid succession of crackling sounds of bones breaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guardian's body was reduced to pieces, and blood flowed through the gaps between Marcus' fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guardian's eyes were wide open, brimming with unyielding resentment. He never dreamed that his life would end in this way...</span></p><div class="pagination">
