Josie only needed to buy some furniture, appliances, and daily necessities to move in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next three days, accompanied by Marcus, Josie purchased all the furniture and appliances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could move in as long as she opened the windows and ventilated the house for a few months.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past few days, Marcus went shopping with Josie in the market during the day and practiced Timeless Warrior's Grimoire at night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, on the fourth day, he broke through to Stage Four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His strength had leaped!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Marcus did not ignore Josie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every night, they had sex on time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie felt extremely satisfied and looked much better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, Marcus spent another day teaching Josie the Magic Codex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the beginning, Josie didn't believe that magic existed in this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Marcus' demonstration, she believed it and began to study seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus mainly developed in Solomia and he was worried about leaving Josie alone in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she was in danger, Marcus could only worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, it was very necessary to teach her magic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition, Marcus also ordered the Axe Gang to send some people to secretly protect Josie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only after doing all this did Marcus feel relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, Marcus went to Kingston University again to visit Natalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He learned about her practice of Magic Codex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia was young but had a high level of comprehension. She could already skillfully cast both fire and thunder magic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But since Magic Codex was an introductory manual for wizards, this kind of fire and thunder had no offensive effect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It could only be used for performance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia had always been very low-key and had never shown her magic in front of outsiders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Marcus appreciate her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, he taught her the two spells of lightning and fireball respectively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to her comprehension, she would be able to master the two spells in at most one month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this way, she also had a certain ability to protect herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to her busy studies, she didn't have much time to spend with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus left Kingston University alone and just walked to the school gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A red Ferrari stopped in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina got out of the car and gave Marcus a charming smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, she wore a light-colored dress, which matched her smooth skin and exquisite face like a person in a painting, impressing people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially her height, which added a sense of grandeur and elegance to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I have been waiting for you here for a long time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked at Melina and asked, "Wait for me? What's the matter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He liked her outfits, so Marcus couldn't help but look at her a few more times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's nothing important. I just want to thank you for saving me that day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina combed her hair, and her arms shone brightly under the sunlight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are Natalia's classmate, so it is my duty. If you want to thank someone, then thank her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had a pretty good impression of Melina. At least she was a girl who had gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yesterday he bought a villa in Flourish Manor and Melina gave him a discount of 100 million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, do you mean that our relationship can only be built because of Natalia? Without her, can't I be your friend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing Marcus' words, a trace of loss appeared on Melina's delicate face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked a bit pitiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's not what I meant. It's just that we met through Natalia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus began to explain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm just kidding. I'm already very happy that you can talk to me calmly. To thank you, I'd like to treat you to a meal. Is that okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina said with a smile. Her manners were elegant and her conversation was appropriate, giving people a very comfortable feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was indeed a lady from a noble family. Her every movement was charming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked at the time, and it was 11:00 noon, so he said, "Okay, let's just find a restaurant nearby and have something to eat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Marcus agreed, Melina smiled in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She jogged to the passenger seat and took the initiative to open the door for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sat in the car, and Melina started the car. The engine roared wildly, and the car drove away.</span></p><div class="pagination">
