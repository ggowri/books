        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Later," Marcus said curtly, driving Josie's Mercedes and taking her home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had arrived at Josie's home when he received a message from Melina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina: [Marcus, do you not love me anymore?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The message was followed by a pitiful emoji. Clearly, Melina was genuinely upset.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus: [Silly girl, how could I not love you? Don't overthink it.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina: [But you treated me like a stranger today. I feel like I'm not that important to you anymore.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina's tone was full of grievance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus: [Melina, you've misunderstood. I just didn't know how to handle the situation. I care about you deeply. Honestly, even though you all know each other, I was indeed a bit awkward just now.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina: [Alright. I forgive you. But you have to promise to treat me the same as you treat your other women. Otherwise, I'll really get angry, or I'll never see you again.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina's message was followed by a crying emoji.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus: [Don't worry. I promise. Don't cry.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only try his best to comfort her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus knew Melina's behavior was normal. She felt insecure because she loved him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she seemed more sensitive than he had imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina continued: [They're pressuring me to drink, but I can't. Can you come over and stay with me?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus suddenly felt a pang of sympathy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been to the Thurman Villa before and knew about the Thurman family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bowden was getting old, and almost the entire Thurman family relied on Melina. The rest of her family members were not very capable in business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was indeed tough for Melina to negotiate deals alone and have to drink with others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Marcus agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie seemed to sense that Marcus was about to leave and said, "Honey, Melina called you, didn't she? You should go. You've been with me for so long already. I won't be mad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was always a woman with high emotional intelligence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright. I'll head out then. See you later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying goodbye to Josie, Marcus took a taxi back to Fortune Palace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following the room number Melina had told him, he arrived at the private room, only to hear voices from inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since we're all here with genuine intentions to cooperate, let's drink heartily. No one should hold back, regardless of gender. What do you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I agree. Let's all take a shot to show our sincerity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Thurman, everyone else has downed their drinks. Why haven't you? Are you looking down on us? Let me tell you something, if you don't drink, you won't step out of the room today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was followed by a chorus of goading laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't help but frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Melina had texted him, he thought they were just toasting her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was clear that they were pressuring her to drink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus hated people who forced others to drink. He thought drinking should be in moderation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forcing someone to drink was detestable, especially when it was a girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was even more despicable of a group of men to gang up on a girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he even entered the room, Marcus was already seething with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knocked on the door of the private room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A voice came from inside, laced with arrogance and casualness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus pushed the door open and was greeted by a cloud of blue smoke. The room was filled with the smell of tobacco and alcohol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A large table sat in the middle, surrounded by about a dozen people, men and women alike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the head of the table was a young man in his late twenties, dressed in a suit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was lounging back in his chair, legs crossed, with a cigarette dangling from his mouth. He looked utterly arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men and women around him were all deferential to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apart from the dishes on the table, there were also numerous empty bottles of various liquors, beers, and wines of all kinds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked pretty excited, clearly having had quite a bit to drink already.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina's cheeks were slightly flushed, indicating she had also had some alcohol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Marcus' experience, Melina rarely drank, especially not the high-proof spirits on the table. They were definitely not something an ordinary girl could handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus entered the room, a burly man was standing next to Melina, holding a glass of liquor and trying to get her to drink it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a 53-proof liquor, about 5 fluid ounces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a man would be dizzy after downing that much, let alone a young girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' arrival seemed to break the tension in the room. Everyone's eyes turned to him, their expressions scrutinizing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, you're here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus, Melina got up immediately, walked over to him, and took his hand affectionately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This gesture made everyone in the room pause for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man at the head of the table turned cold with undisguised hostility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Thurman, who is this gentleman?" the burly man, Bryson, put the glass down on the table and asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina looked up at Marcus' handsome face and smiled at the group, "Let me introduce you all. This is my boyfriend, Marcus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone exchanged glances in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of them had ever heard that Melina, the successor of the Flourish Group, had a boyfriend!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all curious about who Marcus was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man was even more brazen in his appraisal of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Marcus sensed a warrior's aura from him, and he was at least at Ancient Martial Stage Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was quite unexpected for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Marcus sat down next to Melina. They chatted for a while, acting extremely affectionate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man gritted his teeth, watching them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Thurman, even though your boyfriend is here, you still need to drink this glass with me!" Bryson picked up the glass again and raised it to Melina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at Bryson and said, "Why is a guy like you constantly pressuring a girl to drink? Are you trying to take advantage of Melina's poor tolerance for alcohol?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryson's face turned awkward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned, "I'm just trying to liven up the atmosphere. Besides, this party is gender-neutral. Everyone has to drink the same amount at the table!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied, "There's nothing wrong with livening up the atmosphere, but I despise people who bully a girl into drinking. I'll drink with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Marcus grabbed a bottle of strong liquor from the table, poured himself a full glass, and downed it in one go, right in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The glass was a whopping 5 fluid ounces, yet Marcus didn't even flinch as he finished it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had only taken big sips when toasting each other earlier, and no one had drunk as fiercely as Marcus just did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryson was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your turn," Marcus said to Bryson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryson's face tensed up. He took a sip but instinctively tried to put the glass down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said, "I've already drunk mine. How can you just take a sip? Are you looking down on me?"</span></p></div>
