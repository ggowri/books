        <h1>Chapter 638 Millet's Death</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Millet was sent flying back like a cannonball until his body crashed into a rock on the seaside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rock shattered into fragments, scattering across the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His bones were shattered, and his life was taken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada watched in shock and anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was devastated to witness the death of their leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Millet appeared to be a teenager, he was much older than her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had both lived through a cycle of samsara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At one point, they had even harbored feelings for each other. However, due to their respective duties, they had never expressed their emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the rules of Celestial Arc Order, both the leader and the Holy Maiden were forbidden from engaging in any romantic relationships.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had both adhered to these rules.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, seeing the man she had once admired being slain so ruthlessly, she could no longer hold back her emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears streamed down her face, and her body trembled uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clenching her fists, she shouted at Marcus, "Why did you kill him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sneered, "He brought this upon himself. Didn't you see it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada was silenced by his retort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had spared Millet's life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Millet had attacked Marcus again and ended up dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He brought it on himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you wish to avenge him, I'm ready whenever you are," Marcus said, turning to his car. He glanced at Ada one last time and drove off toward Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada watched him leave with mixed feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't know whether she should hate or thank him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had killed many of her fellow disciples and taken her chastity, but she didn't know if she hated him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't seem as intense as she thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given his strength, he could have easily killed her, yet he had spared her life twice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had let her go and spared Millet's life for her sake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bad person wouldn't have done those things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada was confused. For a time, she was shrouded in complex emotions and left in a state of disorientation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Millet gone, the Celestial Arc Order would inevitably decline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she would not allow that to happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unknown to her thoughts, Marcus arrived at Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He instructed Diana to acquire Bayside Petroleum Company in the name of Death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the deaths of Lonnie and his wife, Bayside Petroleum Company had fallen into chaos with stock prices plummeting. It was the perfect opportunity to buy in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Diana's operation, Marcus successfully acquired all of Bayside Petroleum Company's shares for 150 billion dollars, becoming the real owner of the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This move once again caused a huge stir in the business world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Death had been inactive for two months.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last time he acted, he acquired four emerging industry groups in Kingston at 350 billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than two months, the market value of those four groups had skyrocketed, approaching a trillion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, it was Bayside Petroleum Company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the company in disarray and stock prices dropping, Marcus seized the opportunity to acquire it entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His precision and speed in executing these acquisitions were as sharp as a surgeon's scalpel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It quickly became the talk of the town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' reason for acquiring Bayside Petroleum Company was simple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>T</span><span>o truly grow and build his power, sectors like transportation and energy w</span><span>ere</span><span> critical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already set up his logistics company through Darian, gradually expanding his influence in transportation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, by acquiring Bayside Petroleum Company, he had resolved the issue of energy supply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Marcus had not yet fully engaged in this area, he knew that one day, he would build his superpower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For now, acquiring a petroleum company as a backup was a wise decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Bayside Villa, Marcus immersed himself in his cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He only emerged the next morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in Golden Group's Pharmaceutical Industrial Park, a different scene was unfolding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a luxurious conference room, Yvonne and other senior members of Golden Group sat at one side of the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their counterparts were people from the Weston Land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person leading them was none other than Luna, whom Marcus had met the day before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And surprisingly, Albert was there as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"McHale Pharmaceutical Group is offering this price as a courtesy to you. Otherwise, given our position in the global pharmaceutical industry, a simple sanction would be enough to bankrupt your new company," Luna said arrogantly to Yvonne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne was not happy to hear that.</span></p></div>
