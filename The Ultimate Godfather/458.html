  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This gave Xander an immediate sense of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt as though every ounce of his resources had been spent bringing in the two elders from the Astral Serpent Order to deal with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If not for them, Xander realized that, with his own forces, he and his men might not have stood a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kid, I never expected you to be a Level Four Wizard," one of the Astral Serpent Order elders remarked, his voice tinged with surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus barely seemed to notice. "Cut the crap. Who wants to die first? Or do you want to team up and make it quick?" His tone was casual, but the steel beneath it was unmistakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, he was far more concerned with rescuing Kiera than engaging in a battle of words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two elders exchanged a brief look before the one with dark skin spoke up, his voice dripping with contempt, "You really think you can talk like that in front of us? Just because you're a Level Four Wizard?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The elder's lips curled into a disdainful smile. "That kind of magic might work against regular people, but it's nothing in front of us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other elder, thinner and more impatient, interrupted. "Enough talk. I'll take care of him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without waiting for a response, the elder stepped forward, his body blurring into countless afterimages as he moved at lightning speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Within seconds, he was standing directly in front of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The elder was surrounded by a shimmering protective aura, the raging fire from the forest not even leaving a scratch on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, he gathered an immense surge of Numinous Energy in his palm, unleashing it in a deadly blast aimed directly at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The force of the attack sent a shockwave through the air, warping space itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was clear the elder was using everything he had in a bid to end this quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The power of an Ancient Martial Art Stage Five master surged through his attack, creating an overwhelming pressure that threatened to obliterate everything in its path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kid, I'm going to let you see the true power of an Ancient Martial Art Stage Five master," the elder sneered. "You should be honored to die by my hand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't flinch. He only smirked, and with a casual movement, threw a single punch, meeting the elder's palm strike head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The impact was thunderous, a shockwave that seemed to tear the air apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The elder's expression twisted with mockery, clearly not expecting Marcus to have the audacity to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the moment their attacks collided, the elder's confidence shattered. He could feel an insurmountable force pushing back against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite unleashing his full power, Marcus' punch shattered the elder's attack with ease, its power unchanged, crashing into the elder's body with devastating force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sound of bones cracking filled the air, followed by a sickening crash as the elder was sent flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His body slammed into the ground with the force of a cannonball, blood pouring from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His chest was caved in, his internal organs pulverized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before he died, the elder's eyes widened in shock. "You... you're a Stage Six Ancient Martial Artist..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that final breath, his life was extinguished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sight was so shocking that even Xander, hidden behind a tree, couldn't suppress his terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He never imagined Marcus was this powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One punch&mdash;just one&mdash;had wiped out a Stage Five elder like it was nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other elder, watching in disbelief, finally understood the implications.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Stage Six power Marcus had just unleashed meant he was at a level on par with the Astral Serpent Order's Grandmaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such strength was beyond what they could challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A deep sense of dread filled the remaining elder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His hands shook as he tried to think of an escape, but Marcus was already moving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a single step, Marcus appeared directly in front of the elder, blocking his path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The elder's face went pale as realization hit him. "You think you can stop me? If you harm me, the Astral Serpent Order will come for you. You won't survive our wrath!" His voice trembled with fear, but he was also desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus gave a cold smile. "How do you think your status here compares to your Grandmaster Asher's?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The elder froze, his mind racing. "What... what are you saying? Did you kill Asher?" His voice cracked with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before the elder could get an answer, Marcus' fist was already upon him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The elder never had a chance to react. In an instant, his head exploded under the force of Marcus' punch, his body crumpling lifelessly to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two attacks, two deaths. Both Stage Five elders from the Astral Serpent Order had been obliterated by Marcus in the blink of an eye. The display of power was beyond anything the onlookers could comprehend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not far off, Xander trembled behind a large tree, his face ghostly pale. He had never been so terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man he had sent to kill Marcus had just been destroyed with ease, and now Marcus was walking towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With each step, Xander's fear grew. His knees buckled, and the air around him seemed to grow heavier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A flash of lightning cut through the night, followed by torrential rain that poured down from the heavens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The cold water soaked into Xander's clothes, but it only seemed to intensify the terror coursing through his veins.</span></p><div class="pagination">
