  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This phenomenon was known as blood recognition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus pricked his finger and let a drop of blood fall onto the ring, theoretically, from this moment on, the ring was bound to him personally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He focused on telepathy, attempting to communicate with the ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost in an instant, he became cognizant of an expansive, multi-dimensional space within it, spanning hundreds of cubic feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ring had belonged to Brandon, and it was filled with his personal belongings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus meticulously inventoried all these items.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition to a staggering fortune in cash, the trove contained an array of mystical remedies and herbs. Among these treasures was a Wood Elemental Power Crystal and an introductory grimoire for wizards, aptly named the "Magic Codex."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was ecstatic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These things meant everything to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The herbs and scarce medicinal elixirs were not mere plants but lifelines for cultivation. And there, the Wood Elemental Power Crystal, a relic of verdant might, granted Marcus the ability to command the Wood Attribute Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he studied Magic Codex thoroughly, he might even become a wizard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For now, Marcus set aside the crystal and Magic Codex. His immediate need was strength, and he grabbed a handful of herbs, swallowing them without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment the substances hit his tongue, a powerful medicinal force surged through his veins, spreading warmth and energy through his blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Numinous Energy was instantly replenished, and his body felt invigorated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seizing the opportunity, Marcus immediately began practicing Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hours passed in the blink of an eye. By the time he finished, he had broken through the bottleneck that had been holding him back and advanced to Ancient Martial Stage Two!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I made it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus exhaled, releasing a breath of foul air as his body radiated newfound vitality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The breakthrough meant a complete transformation. Every physical attribute had been elevated to a new standard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he were to face Brandon again, he could defeat him easily, even without relying on the Fire Attribute Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glancing at the time, Marcus realized he had been holed up in his room for a full day and night. It was time to visit his parents at the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he stepped out of his room, he nearly collided with Natalia, who was walking toward him wearing nothing but a black lace bikini.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia had just turned 19, the perfect age for a girl. Her figure, skin, and temperament were all flawless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't help but compare her to the girl who used to dress herself in cartoon-printed underwear, still clinging to her childish innocence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But today, the black lace added a layer of maturity and an inexplicable sense of mystery to her appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, can you help me take a look at my new underwear? Does it look good?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia inched closer, exuding a faint, girlish fragrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her plump breasts commanded attention, framing a tantalizing glimpse of cleavage that was impossible to ignore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Marcus had taken her virginity, Natalia had become more and more alluring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, it suits you very well," Marcus replied with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, you haven't left your room for several days, and you lock the door at night. I'm curious what are you doing in there? Are you hiding something from me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia leaned her head on his chest, pouting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been more willful and capricious before, but now, she seemed different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't talk nonsense," Marcus responded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia suddenly turned overly affectionate, clinging to him in a way that Marcus wasn't used to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're not doing anything bad, why lock the door? Are you afraid I'll sneak in to find you? Marcus, are you impotent?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice dripped with sarcasm, betraying the hurt and frustration his refusal had ignited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll show you my potency tonight if you keep this up!" Marcus shot back, unable to resist the jab.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His competitive nature, especially when it came to his potency, wouldn't let him back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words hanging in the air, he spun on his heel and walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, remember to come home early. I'll wait for you!" Natalia called out teasingly as Marcus made his exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus shook his head. The complicated dynamic between him and Natalia was something he couldn't quite figure out. It was an odd relationship, one that could easily become fodder for gossip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he entered the villa, Marcus couldn't help but notice how Diana's attitude toward him had shifted. Diana had started keeping her distance, almost as if she were deliberately avoiding him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Women are a mystery," he murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With no regard for anything else, Marcus got into his car and sped off to Bayside Hospital, his heart set on seeing Richard and Melinda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had spared no expense for their care. He had hired the best doctors and put them in a VIP ward with round-the-clock nursing staff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he arrived, he found that Richard and Melinda had recovered well from their ordeal. The weight loss they'd suffered was merely a result of their injuries, and they were eager to be discharged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Marcus had other plans. "You're staying for another week," he declared, wanting to ensure that every possible hidden issue was addressed before they left the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already purchased all the daily necessities they would need for the extended stay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he made his way through the hospital corridors, preparing to leave, a familiar figure caught his eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Catherine, the former salesperson from Cedars Villas, whom Marcus had promoted to sales office manager.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was deep in conversation with a tall doctor, Thomas Brown, wearing gold-rimmed glasses. Thomas looked gentle as he spoke to Catherine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Catherine, your mother's condition has worsened. She needs surgery immediately. I've already contacted Charles Miller, the best internal medicine professor in Solomia. He's agreed to perform the surgery, and with him operating, the success rate is at least 80%."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas addressed Catherine with a warm, gentle tone. His approachable demeanor radiated calm, making it clear that she was in safe hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine nodded in gratitude. "Thank you, Thomas. If it weren't for you, I don't know what I would do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas waved his hand dismissively. "Don't mention it. We're old classmates; it's nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After going over some pre-operation precautions, Thomas excused himself and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Catherine was about to step back into the ward, her eyes fell upon Marcus. "Mr. Fitzgerald! What are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus put a finger to his lips, signaling her to keep quiet. "Don't call me Mr. Fitzgerald in public. Just call me Marcus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine blushed slightly but nodded quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is your mother hospitalized here?" Marcus asked with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine nodded. "Yes, it's advanced-stage liver cancer. It's spread, and she needs immediate surgery."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Can you take me to see her?" Marcus said.</span></p><div class="pagination">
