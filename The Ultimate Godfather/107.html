        <h1>Chapter 106 You're a Wizard Too</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman stared at Marcus as if he were some kind of freak of nature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her experience, both warriors and wizards typically focused solely on honing their specialized skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Individuals who possessed both warrior and wizard abilities were scarce, often existing only in legends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never encountered such a person in reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus unleashed his Lightning, she felt her blood run cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, she knew this monster completely outmatched her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In desperation, she pulled out a black orb and smashed it against the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thick cloud of smoke erupted, engulfing the entire area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tried to use this chance to make her escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus had seen right through her cheap trick, materializing right in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nearly jumped out of her skin and tried to bolt, but Marcus's iron grip was already around her throat, lifting her off the ground!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please don't kill me! I'll do anything you want, just let me live!" she begged, pure terror flashing in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't care less about her pleas - he simply snapped her neck without a second thought!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After pocketing both Spatial Rings, he walked away from the scene without looking back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Marcus left, a graceful silhouette appeared on the cliffs overlooking Bayside Road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was veiled in gauze, her presence ethereal and elegant. Through the veil, her striking eyes gleamed as she mused, "Lucky I didn't make my move too soon. I clearly underestimated you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman vanished from the cliff as if she'd never been there at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was the same mysterious woman who had appeared after Brandon's death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was from the Uswad Ancient Martial Art Sect, the Astral Serpent Order, and claimed to be Brandon's junior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprisingly, she had been watching Marcus this whole time without him noticing her presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back at Bayside Villa, Diana approached Marcus, her brow furrowing at the sight of blood on his clothes. "Mr. Fitzgerald, are you alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus shook his head. "The Browns made their move, but they still underestimated my abilities."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, a deadly glint flashed in his deep-set eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew it was time to strike back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, be careful. My investigation shows that Mr. Roger Gellar has his eye on you now. I suspect the Browns' hasty attack is connected to him," Diana said with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew better than anyone just how powerful Roger was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Marcus's recent growth had exceeded her expectations, he was still no match for Roger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it seemed that Roger didn't currently consider this younger brother a threat. Otherwise, Marcus alone wouldn't stand a chance against him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's eyes flickered. He had suspected as much, and Diana's reminder had confirmed his suspicions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, Mr. Fitzgerald," Diana asked, "where did you get that witchcraft book you're teaching them from?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was a spoil of war," Marcus replied. "Why, are you interested in learning?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's sapphire blue eyes sparkled, and she gracefully raised her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A blue flame erupted from her palm, its intense heat making Marcus's skin sting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such powerful flames!" Marcus blurted out, his gaze shifting as he reassessed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, so you're a Wizard too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled, "Mr. Fitzgerald, I'm far more than just a Wizard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus broke into a cold sweat. This woman had been hiding some serious power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt relieved he hadn't tried anything stupid with her earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judging by the flames she'd conjured, her witchcraft level had to be at least Ancient Martial Stage Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Marcus, as powerful as he was now, might not be a match for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in the Kingston Brown family's secret chamber, a messenger rushed in. "Sir, both warriors you sent were killed by Marcus!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Ricardo's eyes flashed with surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both warriors had reached the peak of Ancient Martial Arts Stage Two, making them incredibly formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Together, they could even hold their own against someone who had just advanced to Level Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet even their combined strength hadn't been enough to stop Marcus from killing them both.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such power was beyond Ricardo's wildest expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems I'll have to deal with this brat personally," Ricardo muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deadly glint flashed in Ricardo's eyes. He'd reached the peak of Level Three years ago and was just one step away from Level Four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking out a youngster like Marcus should have been child's play.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The problem was that Marcus was as cunning as a fox. This failed assassination attempt with two elite warriors would definitely put him on high alert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricardo knew that trying the same sneak attack approach wouldn't work anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He racked his brain, trying to figure out how to bait Marcus into coming to him instead.</span></p></div>
