  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All the people present looked at Marcus with strange eyes, and then they showed sarcastic smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jennifer even sneered, "This guy really dared to talk nonsense and even questioned Mr. Dupont.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The piece of material selected by Mr. Dupont is obviously the best one in the scene. Marcus actually said there were cracks inside, and is he using himself as a gambling master?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Camila also smiled, "He is so proud and arrogant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus knew that he could not compare with Mr. Dupont, so he used these kinds of words to disgust Mr. Dupont.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The material chosen by Mr. Dupont has been recognized by Mr. Hansen, and the energy crystal contained inside is absolutely priceless. We'll see about that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Prior to this, Truman had not noticed Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Marcus' words, Truman turned his head, looked at Marcus, and said, "How did you tell there were cracks in the material I chose?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Truman was used to being sought after by others in his daily life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>People were always respectful and only said compliments in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, someone questioned him. It made him uncomfortable and a little angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, to show his good manners, Truman suppressed his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Dupont, please don't mind what Marcus said. Just now, he didn't even want to spend 50 million dollars to buy crystals at the booth. He's just a poor guy who flaunts his presence everywhere!" Camila came up and said to Truman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, she found the opportunity to strike up a conversation with Truman. She was so happy and made herself appear perfect to attract Truman's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Truman sneered and said to Marcus. "I'm not surprised that you are such a person. If you are jealous of me, you can make a lot of money and buy better materials instead of slandering me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus rolled his eyes. "Do you really think you have anything worth making me jealous of?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, Marcus didn't want to pay attention to Truman, but Truman persisted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was once again stunned at Marcus' words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Well, Truman was the son of Asher from the Astral Serpent Order. His status was respected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the other hand, Marcus was only a stranger and was barely at Ancient Martial Stage Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How could he talk back to Truman!? It was simply reckless!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Poor pauper, let me tell you something. Mr. Dupont is the son of Elder Dupont of the Astral Serpent Order. His identity is something you can never reach in your lifetime. Even if you admit your jealousy, no one will laugh at you. To put it frankly, you two are worlds apart!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Camila stood up again to help Truman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Miss, just ignore this guy. It's almost time to open the stone. I will prove someone wrong with practical actions rather than relying on my identity to suppress him," Truman gave Camila a gentle smile and looked quite like a gentleman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at his smile, Camila suddenly blushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She nodded hard, "Mr. Dupont, you are right. The stone will prove everything later, and let's see how that guy's gonna be arrogant in front of you again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Truman's performance not only impressed Camila and Jennifer but also won the approval of most people present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His identity was respected, and the Astral Serpent Order was his backing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he kept saying that he did not oppress people by force. This kind of character was not comparable to other aristocratic men!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The staff dragged the tools, and soon, they began to cut stones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Marcus bought the raw crystal earlier than Truman, it was time to open his piece of material.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That piece of material had potholes and no appearance, so many people did not want to see it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some people thought it was a waste of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If this material could produce energy crystals, they would dare to eat the entire waste of the site!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Pauper, your precious stone will be revealed soon, and you will be disappointed!" Camila mocked Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her address to him was too sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cooke couldn't stand it any longer and snapped at her, "Miss, you'd better shut your filthy mouth! Mr. Fitzgerald has never done anything to hurt you, but why do you keep pushing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Cooke said, Marcus never even paid attention to Camila and Jennifer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was not because Marcus was afraid of them but because he wouldn't stoop to their level or waste time on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the sound of a sharp electric tool, the chainsaw sawed into Marcus' material little by little.</span></p><div class="pagination">
