In mere moments, the figure of Phoenix materialized within Marcus' line of sight. As Marcus studied him, a sense of familiarity struck. Unable to suppress his curiosity, he asked, "Are you Phoenix of the Astral Serpent Order?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The aura emanating from his cultivation manuals was unmistakably akin to that of Asher, another elder of the Order. Yet Phoenix's strength far surpassed Asher's, and his mastery and presence leagues were ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Marcus received no reply. Phoenix's eyes remained hollow, and his expression was devoid of recognition, leaving Marcus puzzled. Before Marcus could question further, Phoenix sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying Hand Strike ripped through the air, its destructive force resonating with the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Six. The blow distorted the very space it traversed, threatening obliteration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes coldly glinted as he met the attack with a powerful punch. The clash was cataclysmic. Waves of destructive force erupted outward, shaking the earth. Marcus was forced back several steps, and his blood surged within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression darkened. Phoenix's power exceeded expectations. Though their cultivation levels were comparable, Phoenix had spent far longer honing his abilities. Worse still, the mysterious force controlling Phoenix seemed to have unlocked latent potential, pushing his strength even further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unrelenting, Phoenix lunged again, unleashing another devastating Hand Strike. The strike transformed into a massive, sky-shrouding palm, intent on crushing Marcus beneath it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised his fist and launched a punch to meet the incoming Hand Strike head-on. The overwhelming and suppressive force drove his feet deep into the ground, leaving his expression slightly grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Summoning his Shadow Step technique, Marcus evaded the attack just in time. A golden scimitar materialized in his hand, gleaming with lethal intent. Without hesitation, he swung it toward Phoenix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Phoenix's pupils flared with a crimson glow. He muttered an incantation under his breath, and an eerie energy surged over his body, forming an invisible link with the golden scimitar in Marcus' grasp. In the next instant, the scimitar trembled violently before forcefully wrenching itself free from Marcus' hold, landing firmly in Phoenix's control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it," Marcus cursed, and his face hardened. He hadn't anticipated Phoenix's ability to control weapons. Without wasting a moment, Phoenix wielded the scimitar to unleash a savage Blade Ray, slicing through the air toward Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sidestepped the Blade Ray with a flicker of Shadow Step, and his movements were as fluid as a shadow slipping through cracks. As he steadied himself, the Thunderfire Power surged around him in full force, merging seamlessly with the Timeless Numinous Energy. Together, they coalesced into a devastating Fist Ray, radiating unparalleled destruction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With unyielding resolve, Marcus unleashed the Fist Ray, aiming directly at Phoenix's body. Phoenix countered with a massive Hand Strike, meeting the Fist Ray head-on. The collision produced a deafening shockwave, reverberating across the battlefield like a thunderous drumbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clash left them momentarily locked in a dead heat, and their powers were evenly matched. But Marcus' Fist Ray carried the latent terror of Thunderfire Power. The crackling energy coursed through his strike, infiltrating Phoenix's body with unrelenting ferocity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Phoenix's frame shuddered as the Thunderfire Power erupted within him, spreading like wildfire. A sharp and acrid stench of burnt flesh filled the air, a testament to the devastating force that had just ravaged his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dare you use Thunderfire Power against me? I'll tear your limb for this," Phoenix cursed, his eyes now clear but burning with unbridled fury. The scimitar in his hand danced with a life of its own as he unleashed a flurry of Blade Rays, and their trajectories were wickedly precise, leaving Marcus no room to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smirked coldly. "I just freed you from that sinister force. You should be thanking me." In an instant, his form blurred as he activated Shadow Step once more, darting to the side with lightning-fast precision, evading the onslaught with practiced ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, a surge of power radiated from his body as Lightning and Firebolt erupted simultaneously, their brilliance lighting up the battlefield like twin suns. The aura of a Level Five Wizard enveloped Phoenix, oppressive and formidable. The combined force of the two magics was nothing short of devastating, a testament to the immense power Marcus wielded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Phoenix paused for a moment, clearly surprised. "A Wizard? No wonder you managed to kill three of our Order's masters." Yet his expression soon hardened. "But today, your life ends here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring the oncoming magic, Phoenix charged, and his scimitar flashed as it unleashed an even more fearsome Blade Ray. The sheer force of the attack, fused with the essence of his Ancient Martial mastery, seemed capable of cleaving the heavens themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, undeterred, stood his ground. "Celestial Reversal!" he roared, unleashing the ultimate counterattack.</span></p><div class="pagination">
