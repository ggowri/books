  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You think you can take me on? You're just asking for trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus wiped the dust off his hands, his expression dripping with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Christopher, his hand shaking, pointed at Marcus and stammered, "Who the hell are you? How dare you hit my men? You really aren't worried about the cops arresting you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus chuckled darkly and said, "You're the ones who started it. I'm just defending myself. You really think the cops are gonna help you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that, Christopher's face turned an even deeper shade of red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't expect Marcus to know the law.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sure, he ran this place, but his power was limited to a few thugs. He didn't have enough influence to control the police.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Especially now, with Marcus being in the right. There was no way the cops would side with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are we gonna do now? Christopher can't even deal with this brat. Does that mean the wedding is off?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Lucas began to panic, his face going pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He dreaded the idea of the wedding falling apart, and if that happened, he'd have to return the 1.88 million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That would destroy his business. He couldn't let that happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, Tristan stepped forward, his eyes scanning the room before he spoke in a calm voice, "Don't worry, everyone. I know the captain of Ganston's SWAT team. I'll call him now and have them take care of this thug."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment the words left his mouth, Christopher, Lucas, Tracy, Simon, and the others all looked at him with wide eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tristan knew the captain of Ganston's SWAT team?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was one of the most elite squads in the city!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was clear how powerful Tristan's connections were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And even though Marcus was tough, if the SWAT team showed up, his street skills wouldn't stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, SWAT wasn't just average cop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tristan, you're not messing with us, right? This is for real?" Lucas asked, his voice filled with hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tristan nodded calmly, his demeanor never changing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lucas couldn't help but notice that since Tristan showed up, nothing seemed to faze him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He handled every situation with that cool, unshakable confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was obvious that Tristan was someone with serious power. Only someone like that could remain so calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now that Tristan was involved, Marcus was as good as done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tristan stepped aside and made a phone call. Less than two minutes later, he returned to the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Christopher's excitement was palpable as he asked, "Is it done?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tristan gave a casual nod, "The SWAT team is nearby finishing up another operation. They've already got the suspect in custody, and they should be here soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that, Christopher, Lucas, Simon, Tracy, and the others looked thrilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tracy gazed at Tristan, her eyes full of admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She never expected her boyfriend to have connections like this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew the captain of Ganston's SWAT team&mdash;now that was impressive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was so good to have a Kingston native boyfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Look at Tracy's boyfriend&mdash;he's the real deal. Now look at you, picking this brat who's only going to get in our way. When the SWAT team shows up, I can't wait to see what he does. Honestly, you'd be better off marrying Bobby. A guy like this doesn't stand a chance against the SWAT team," Simon said to Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He then turned to Jane, giving Tristan and Tracy his approval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the SWAT team on the way, Jane became even more anxious. She turned to Marcus and said, "Honey, maybe you should leave for now. I'll go with them, and we'll figure something out later. Otherwise, if the SWAT team really shows up, I'm worried it could get ugly for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Jane's eyes, Marcus, despite being wealthy and the chairman of Golden Group, wasn't untouchable here in Ganston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the strongest didn't always win in unfamiliar territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And this wasn't just any police force&mdash;this was the SWAT team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had more authority, better weapons, and a lot more power than regular cops.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Marcus stayed, it would be like walking into a trap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't want Marcus to get caught up in this because of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus, however, wasn't concerned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He casually pulled out his phone and opened Facebook.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There, in his feed, was a post showing the Ganston SWAT team making an arrest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The timestamp read about an hour ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The post was made by someone named Miles Donovan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus had saved him under "Ganston SWAT Team Captain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He opened the chat and saw the date&mdash;this was from the day after they captured the Black Hawk Legion leader in Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't know how Miles had gotten his account, but the guy had added him and had sent a ton of respectful, almost fawning messages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus had replied casually, not thinking much of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, here he was, about to meet the guy face-to-face.</span></p><div class="pagination">
