        <h1>Chapter 329 Death</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, a professionally dressed secretary entered, placing a document on Mark's desk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Rivera might be sleeping. Maybe he was making out with me for too long last night. I'd better not disturb him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The secretary thought so and wanted to quit the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she smelled of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought she was hallucinating and sniffed hard, but the bloody smell did exist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The secretary stopped, subconsciously walking towards Mark behind the desk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did she discover a pool of blood left on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She opened Mark's suit, revealing Mark's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a blood hole between his eyebrows, and his eyes still widened in horror!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this horrible scene, the secretary was so scared that she turned pale, ran out of the office and immediately called the police!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shooting of Mark, the president of Rivera Construction Group, was instantly spread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole group was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They launched an investigation into the murderer, sealing off the headquarters to corner the suspect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus had already left and got on the high-speed train that returned to Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon arrival, police reviewed the Rivera Construction Group's headquarters surveillance, revealing only the back of a black-clad tall man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To their shock, the surveillance video always failed when the back appeared, preventing the other party's true appearance from being recorded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, even if they knew that Mark was shot intentionally, they couldn't find the murderer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was because Marcus activated his Numinous Energy upon entering Rivera Construction Group's headquarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the effect of powerful Numinous Energy, all those cameras would automatically lose their efficacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the news of Mark's death spread all over Solariae.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rivera Construction Group was in turmoil, and its stock plummeted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many partners had called for the termination of the contracts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within a few hours, Rivera Construction Group was mired in debt, which affected the operation of the whole company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And at this time, a mysterious figure took action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the price of 200 billion dollars, he bought 100% equity of Rivera Construction Group, making the group his property entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that man's signature was Death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The name was unfamiliar in Solariae but well-known within Kingston's business community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just over a month ago, Death did the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the fall of the Brown family in Kingston, Death bought four emerging pillar industrial groups of the Browns for 350 billion dollars, causing a sensation in the entire Kingston business community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And just over a month after the acquisition of those four companies, their shares had soared, and now their market value had exceeded 800 billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the president of Rivera Construction Group was shot dead, and this person took action again, acquiring the group ranking top ten in Solariae at a price of 200 billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such foresight and decisiveness were terrific!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, Emma, who was forced to be a waitress in the nightclub, also got the news that her father was shot and that a mysterious person had acquired Rivera Construction Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face conveyed despair, reminding her of Tony's words, which were now proven to be true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma knew that Marcus did all this, and her hatred for Marcus intensified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She just couldn't understand why that seemingly unremarkable young man could release such a powerful energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just because of a fight in the bidding in Solomia, there was a gap between the Rivera family and Marcus, which directly led to the decline of her family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her uncle was dismissed and investigated, her father was shot, and she was gang-raped and sold to a nightclub as a waitress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How miserable they were!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma was full of remorse, regretting that she didn't dissuade her father from fighting against Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, their family would certainly not suffer all this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus quietly returned to Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had remolded hundreds of guns in a few days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, where have you been these days?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana asked Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I went to the Solariae to get guns," Marcus answered with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How many have you got? Less than 100 is meaningless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said so as she inlaid energy crystal into the gun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they had enough energy crystals but lacked guns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You will know later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus just smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the evening, Jack's men arrived, and a trailer came, which was full of brand-new wooden boxes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some burly men then carried the wooden cases into the basement of the villa.</span></p></div>
