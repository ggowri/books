  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman in front of Marcus was supposed to be that kind of person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Marcus' astonishment, however, she was remarkably youthful, appearing to be around his age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to kill you on behalf of Mr. Roger Gellar!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman said, and her sapphire-like eyes suddenly became sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she frantically devastatingly attacked Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the woman was in the sky, her terrifying magic power swept away rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a casual flick of her finger, a magical beam plummeted from on high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, it seemed as if the entire space had ground to a halt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus only felt the powerful Binding Force clamping down on his body in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frantically activated the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire to break free from the Binding Force and quickly performed the Shadow Step to dodge to one side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attack crashed into the ground, gouging out an almost thirty-foot-deep crater in an instant. The earth quaked violently beneath their feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I truly didn't expect that your strength had grown to such an extent. How could you avoid my attack?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman's body was still hovering in the air, and her voice was incredibly ethereal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes flashed with a steely glint as he said, "You've truly gone to extraordinary lengths just to kill me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman sneered, "Because you impede Mr. Roger Gellar from inheriting the position of Godfather. Everyone who stands in the way of Mr. Roger Gellar's succession will die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she was trying to attack Marcus again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She exerted an even more intense destructive energy on Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the sky turned blood-red, as if it were a hell on earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus trembled all over in such an environment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the fear from his soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only when there was a huge gap in the state between Marcus and his opponent would he have such a feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without warning, the woman swept her hand forward, her palm aglow with a blinding and annihilating light, hurtling towards Marcus with a vengeance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her outstretched Hand Strike seemed to blot out a portion of the sky, leaving Marcus with seemingly nowhere to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, just as her Hand Strike was about to make contact with Marcus, a searing beam of destruction erupted from the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The light shone brightly between heaven and earth and directly collided with that destructive handprint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a deafening crashing sound, the originally terrifying and boundless destructive handprint exploded directly and turned into bits of starlight that dissipated with the wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene made the woman widen her blue eyes and look in the direction from which the destructive beam came.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There</span><span> stood Diana, her blue eyes as indifferent as a wintry sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, when is it your turn to interfere in my affairs?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman asked in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald is the Godfather's anointed heir, and yet you attack him in broad daylight. How could I possibly stand idly by?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's tone was full of dominance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, she was also standing proudly in the air, surrounded by golden light, looking as dazzling as a goddess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, he's just a worthless wretch. What gives him the right to inherit the Godfather's position? Only Mr. Roger Gellar is worthy of such an honor. Marcus has no place in this world," The woman sneered, her voice dripping with scorn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, if you dare to stop me again, I'll also kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I'll just see how formidable you are!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana replied, her eyes blazing with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very well. I'll deal with you first and then kill this piece of trash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman sneered, and light burst out around her, emitting extremely terrifying magical energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a heartbeat, she released a terrifying attack in the direction where Diana was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heaven and earth trembled as an endless wave of destructive force barreled forward, engulfing Diana within seconds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana also exerted her energy, and endless golden light surrounded her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She released the Hand Strike that collided with the woman's attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, a thunderous boom reverberated through the sky, and the destructive force ricocheted in all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, Diana, you are so arrogant. You think you can match me? I'll show you the true meaning of power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arrogance showed on the woman's face as if she didn't take Diana seriously at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she injected a destructive force towards her attack once again, attempting to kill Diana completely here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before long, the arrogance on the woman's face disappeared utterly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sensed an irresistible power surging within Diana's Hand Strike, a force that crushed and obliterated her attack with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That same power then hurtled towards her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a deafening roar, and the woman let out a grunt of pain. Her body was sent careening thousands of feet through the air before she managed to steady herself, a mouthful of blood spraying from her mouth.</span></p><div class="pagination">
