        <h1>Chapter 685 Remove the Blood Curse</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After nonchalantly tossing the guardian's body onto the ground, Marcus extended his hand. In an instant, three Spatial Rings appeared in his palm and then were pocketed by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada was dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Prior to this moment, she had been worried about Marcus, fearing that he might come to harm when facing off against the three guardians.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, there was a Curse Weaver at the peak of Level Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the three guardians joined forces, even an expert at the Ancient Martial Stage Eight should take them seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at that moment, Ada realized that her worries were completely unnecessary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire fight lasted less than two minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus achieved victory in an utterly overwhelming fashion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three guardians were not even ants in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were eliminated instantly by his random attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shock overwhelmed Ada. For a moment, she had no idea what level Marcus' strength had reached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll heal you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when Ada was still stunned, Marcus' voice rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only at that moment did she snap out of her daze. Involuntarily, she took a step backward, her eyes fixed on him with a hint of timidity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why, I'm not going to harm you. Why are you staying so far from me?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"N-Nothing..." Ada replied somewhat mechanically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she added, "I think that I've been afflicted by their Blood Curse. Are you sure you can get rid of it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled confidently, "I never brag."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, he just stretched out his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blood inside the body of the Curse Weaver at the peak of Level Seven was drawn out and then gathered in Marcus' palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With his blood, your Blood Curse can be removed," he explained, his eyes sweeping over Ada's delicate form as he sought out the site of the Blood Curse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nevertheless, in her eyes, his gaze seemed somewhat obscene. Her delicate face instantly flushed red, and she asked, "What on earth are you planning to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied, "I am searching for the location of the Blood Curse."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It then dawned on Ada that she had misunderstood him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit her red lip with her pearly teeth, pointed her at her left breast, and said, "The Blood Curse seems to be here. How are you going to remove it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus ordered, "Take off all your upper clothes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada's pretty face immediately blushed scarlet with embarrassment, and she gritted her teeth and asked, "You bastard, don't you think you are very shameless?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus frowned and said, "As a warrior, you ought to be aware that transmitting Numinous Energy requires no impediments. Otherwise, it will obstruct the flow of Numinous Energy. I don't understand what you are talking about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And if I wanted to harm you, do you think you have the ability to resist?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words immediately rendered Ada speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, she even planned to stop him from curing her Blood Curse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at the thought of her mission to revive the Celestial Arc Order, she had no choice but to take off the clothes from her upper body gradually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, her light pink bra and her deep cleavage were exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is the Blood Curse outside the bra?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada had to unbutton her bra little by little, revealing her round, full breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this okay now?" she asked through gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cheeks were burning with shyness, and she had an overwhelming urge to find a place to hide away. As a result, she gradually shut her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus strode up to Ada.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could sense his masculine scent, which made her heart beat even faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Marcus had already activated the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire and quickly mobilized the Timeless Numinous Energy to merge with the blood of the guardian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His big hand slowly pressed on Ada's plump breast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, she shuddered and uttered a low groan.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada actually felt an unprecedented sense of relief, which she had previously experienced when Marcus had sex with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was overcome with shame and comfort, a combination that lured her into a state of self-indulgence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the situation was completely different from before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Marcus was treating her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Timeless Numinous Energy kept infiltrating Ada's body, a powerful surge of pleasure immediately engulfed her entire being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but emit a series of soft moans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You pervert, what are you doing to me? If you dare to rape me, I will fight you to the death!" Ada roared through gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but open her eyes, only to find that Marcus had just placed his big hand on her left breast without making any other improper movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did he shut her mouth in shame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as the treatment progressed further, the feeling of comfort around Ada became stronger and stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She merely felt an electric current coursing through her body, continuously stimulating each and every sensitive nerve within her.</span></p></div>
