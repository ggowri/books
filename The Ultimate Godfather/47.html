        <h1>Chapter 46 Will You Miss Me</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well..." Marcus was at a loss for words. He casually asked, "You're so gorgeous and wealthy. How could you possibly lack a boyfriend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The long-haired beauty glared at Marcus and snapped, "That's my business. Don't pry! If you don't want to pay, then just agree to my request. Five million dollars for one day&mdash;there's no job out there that pays that much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus responded, "I already told you, it's not that I don't want to pay; I just can't access the money right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The long-haired beauty crossed her arms and gave Marcus a once-over. For the first time, she realized that he was actually quite handsome, and he was exactly her type. "I don't care. Either you pay up now, or you agree to my condition!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus felt helpless. This woman wasn't giving him any choice, so he reluctantly nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His battered secondhand car was almost totaled, so he called a tow truck to take it to the scrapyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the long-haired beauty's Lamborghini was still drivable even in its damaged state. She floored the accelerator, and the car roared off into the distance as if venting her frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus hailed a cab back to Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he got in, he received a message from Sweetheart: [My name is Yvonne Miller. Meet me at my house tomorrow. Just call me Yvonne, and practice your act carefully. Don't blow it.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[What's your name? Tell me now, or I won't be able to find you if you vanish!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't help but find Yvonne rather interesting. Her fiery and straightforward personality was rare among the women he'd encountered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus quickly tapped the screen with both thumbs, replying to the message: [My name is Marcus. See you at the same place tomorrow.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne replied instantly: [I hope you keep your promise!] She added a threatening emoji at the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus turned off his phone screen. Less than half an hour later, he arrived at Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he walked in, he saw Natalia packing her things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are you going?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's an event at school tomorrow. It'll last about a week. I got an invitation and need to attend," Natalia said as she packed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it in Kingston?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. I'll be gone for a week. Will you miss me?" Natalia gazed at him with a look full of affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will." Marcus nodded instinctively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Liar!" Natalia pouted, her eyes brimming with reproach. "You're always so busy these days. The door of your room is closed at night, and I barely see you during the day. When would you even have time to miss me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scratching his head, Marcus said, "A man should prioritize his career, shouldn't he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia pursed her lips. "That's what they all say. But you're not just busy with work&mdash;I know there are plenty of girls pining for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Natalia's playful yet mischievous expression, Marcus could only sigh and retreat to his room with a convenient excuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting cross-legged on his bed, Marcus retrieved the Wood Elemental Power Crystal he had confiscated from Brandon from his Spatial Ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, a surge of pure wood-elemental energy flowed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus activated the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire and began refining it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the news of Solomia Hospital's success in saving a late-stage liver cancer patient who had suffered massive post-surgical bleeding spread like wildfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It shook the entire medical community of Uswad like a ticking time bomb! Major media outlets rushed to feature the story on their front pages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Journalists swarmed Solomia Hospital, eager to interview the legendary doctor. The hospital quickly became the epicenter of Uswad's medical field.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The news even reached overseas, prompting several renowned foreign medical institutions to send their representatives to Solomia Hospital for an investigation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But by then, the doctor in question was no longer at the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To capitalize on the hype, Solomia Hospital sealed all information about Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Photos that had been uploaded online were promptly taken down using various methods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the nurses who were at the scene, the hospital's management threatened them with dismissal to ensure their silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a time, this mysterious doctor became even more enigmatic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All that people knew was that he was young and a local of Solomia, but nothing more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor's deeds swept through Uswad like a storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, was completely unaware of all this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just two hours, he successfully refined and fused the Wood Elemental Power Crystal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this, he now commanded two elemental powers&mdash;one of fire, the other of wood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The increase in overall power was undeniable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The boost to his combat strength was substantial, even though his cultivation level remained at Ancient Martial Stage Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the remaining time, Marcus began meticulously planning the establishment of his medical company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He aimed to launch a groundbreaking medical enterprise, officially stepping into the healthcare industry. Using the medical field and the Golden Group as his foundation, Marcus intended to generate the funds necessary to build his personal influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus understood deeply that only with sufficient power could he remain invincible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this in mind, he dialed Michelle's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Michelle answered the phone, "Mr. Fitzgerald, is there something I can assist you with?"</span></p></div>
