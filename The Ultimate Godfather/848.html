  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene left everyone present in a state of shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected that a simple college reunion would spiral into such chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua had his partnership with Golden Pharmaceutical Manufacture revoked, was forced to apologize publicly, and ended up with a broken arm, flung violently across the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It all stemmed from his underestimation and mockery of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a lesson to everyone present: Never underestimate anyone, no matter how they appear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus seemed like just a young, good-looking guy, but he possessed power beyond their wildest imaginations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With just a few phone calls, he had dismantled the core businesses of Hannah, Molly, and Joshua.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had been so foolish to mock and humiliate someone they hadn't even recognized as a major player.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Call an ambulance! Let's get him to the hospital!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone finally snapped out of it, shouting to the others while starting CPR on Joshua.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others quickly pulled out their phones to dial for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, paid no attention to Joshua. He turned to Josie and said, "Ms. Shelman, I don't think we need to stay here any longer. Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie, still shaken by Marcus' actions, nodded mechanically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus took her hand, and they began to walk out of the restaurant, leaving the stunned crowd behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they stepped out of the private room, Josie apologized to Marcus, "I'm so sorry, honey. I brought you to this reunion just to introduce you to my friends. I never expected this to happen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus just smiled, "It's not your fault. I'm glad you brought me. If you had met them again later, they might have found some other way to cause trouble for you. I've taken care of it today. Next time you go to a reunion, they won't dare to mess with you again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie nodded in agreement, feeling that Marcus' words made perfect sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they were about to leave Fortune Palace, they were met by a tall, stunningly beautiful girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Spotting Marcus and Josie holding hands, the girl looked momentarily surprised before flashing them a charming smile. "Hello there, Mr. Fitzgerald, Ms. Shelman. Are you here for dinner too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Melina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was dressed in an elegant gown, her exposed skin gleaming under the lights, making her look even more beautiful and graceful than she had over a month ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as she saw Marcus and Josie's intertwined hands, a flicker of jealousy crossed her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Encountering Melina like this made Marcus feel a bit awkward. He forced a smile and said, "Yeah, Melina. How about you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina nodded with a smile. "Yes, I'm here for a gathering. I just got here. Are you done eating?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah," Marcus replied, unsure of what else to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had planned to meet Melina after seeing Josie, but he hadn't expected to run into her like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie immediately sensed the tension between Marcus and Melina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could see the affection&mdash;and a hint of jealousy&mdash;in Melina's gaze toward Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant their relationship was more complicated than it seemed on the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Josie didn't feel jealous. She had known about Marcus' many women before their relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What surprised her was that the last time Marcus had taken her to look at a villa, Melina seemed to have only a friendly relationship with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, her feelings for him had clearly evolved from friendship to something deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie could tell that Melina was deeply in love with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she saw them holding hands, Melina's body visibly trembled, though she tried hard to suppress her emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, Mr. Fitzgerald, Ms. Shelman, my gathering is about to start. See you around," Melina said with a sweet smile before heading straight for the elevator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, she felt not only jealousy but also a pang of loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus hadn't contacted her or even informed her that he was in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Melina feel utterly neglected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her sense of loss grew stronger, and she felt her eyes welling up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quickly, she took out a tissue to dab her eyes, took a deep breath, and tried to stay calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I knew he had many women before I got involved with him. I thought I could handle it, so why do I feel so hurt when I see it with my own eyes?" Melina thought to herself in the elevator, feeling even more aggrieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I can't be like this. Otherwise, if I see him with another woman again, I'll break down completely," she comforted herself in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She remembered how Marcus had warned her that he had many women when they first got involved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Melina had acted very magnanimously, saying that as long as Marcus loved her and didn't leave her, she wouldn't care about the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed she had been completely blinded by love back then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina's feelings for Marcus had deepened over time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past month without him, he had been on her mind constantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, seeing him with another woman had left even the strong-willed Melina feeling vulnerable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew if she didn't leave soon, she might burst into tears right there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina was attending an industry gathering today, where business would be discussed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she couldn't compose herself, it could affect her performance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, in the elevator, she kept adjusting her mindset, trying to calm down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, Melina seems upset. Should you go comfort her?" Seeing Melina's disappointed figure, Josie said to Marcus, her tone tinged with a hint of probing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied awkwardly, "She's probably heading to an important gathering. We can talk after it's over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he took Josie's hand again and continued toward the exit of Fortune Palace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, I knew you had many women before. I won't be mad if you go comfort her now. She's still very young&mdash;probably not even 20 yet. Young girls usually have high hopes for love, dreaming of finding their own Prince Charming, just like I did. Go ahead and talk to her. I really feel bad for her," Josie said sincerely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie really felt for Melina, seeing her as a young girl who deserved better than to be hurt by love.</span></p><div class="pagination">
