  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus immediately called Benjamin Mitchell and laid out the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin was busy entertaining a foreign delegation, but as soon as he heard Marcus' report, his face hardened with frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With no time to handle it himself, he instructed Amelia Morgan to head over and sort things out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus agreed without hesitation. Amelia had handled similar issues for him before, always with precision and efficiency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! You're still putting on a show? I told you, City Hall's basically my personal playground. Call whoever you want&mdash;it won't make a difference. I'm not signing off on this inspection unless..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar's smug grin widened, and the booze in his system only made him bolder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't like he'd been busy with important work&mdash;he'd been out drinking with friends, and the whole "meeting" with Michelle had never been on his radar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the classic power-play used by guys like him&mdash;stalling the process until the other party got desperate enough to pay up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Oscar shot Marcus a sly look and rubbed his fingers together in that all-too-familiar "money" gesture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus caught on immediately but didn't even blink. "I'd love to see how this 'family-owned City Hall' of yours runs when someone finally puts you in check."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar laughed like it was the funniest thing he'd ever heard. "Oh, this I gotta see. I'll be right here, front and center, waiting for your big shot to show up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From his perspective, Marcus was just another cocky businessman who thought money could buy power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcus had any real connections, his pharmaceutical industrial park would've been greenlit ages ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that it wasn't was proof enough that Marcus didn't have anyone powerful in his corner, which was the reason why Oscar was so arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deputy Cromwell, I think that guy just called Mayor Benjamin. Should we just approve the inspection? It's not like it costs us anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derrick, one of Cromwell's subordinates, spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike the others, he'd stayed sober and was thinking a little more clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Oscar just sneered. "Derrick, don't tell me you've turned into a spineless little mouse. If that guy actually knew Mayor Benjamin, don't you think we'd have been told to roll out the red carpet for him by now? Look at them&mdash;still playing by our rules. If you wanna move up in life, kid, you better learn to read the room. Stop acting like a squirrel trying to cross the freeway."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar's words left Derrick red-faced and embarrassed, his mouth half-open like he wanted to reply but thought better of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew Oscar's temper. The moment he started handing out "life lessons," it was best to keep quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deputy Cromwell's got a point. If that guy really had Mayor Benjamin on speed dial, I'd do a headstand and eat a boot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of Cromwell's lackeys chimed in with a laugh, his voice thick with mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar burst out laughing, slapping his thigh like it was the punchline of a great joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, five minutes later, the sound of tires crunching gravel turned everyone's attention to the road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sleek executive Maybach rolled up and stopped in front of them with the smooth precision of a well-rehearsed entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The side door slid open, and out stepped Amelia Morgan, followed by a small team of City Hall staff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her, Oscar's grin vanished. His eyes widened, and he felt the buzz of the alcohol drain out of him like water from a cracked bottle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Morgan? What are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar's voice cracked slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew exactly who Amelia was&mdash;Mayor Benjamin's personal secretary, and someone with serious pull.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deputy Cromwell, I'm here under orders from Mayor Benjamin to investigate accusations that you've been abusing your position for personal gain. Effective immediately, you're suspended from duty pending an inquiry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia shot Marcus a quick nod before locking eyes with Cromwell. Her tone was as sharp as a paper cut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle stood there in shock, her eyes darting between Marcus and Amelia. She never imagined that Marcus had such high-level connections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One phone call, and Amelia Morgan was on-site in less than five minutes. That wasn't just influence&mdash;it was power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar's face turned an ashy shade of gray, and he swayed as if his legs could barely hold him up. "You can't just throw accusations like that without proof! Not even Mayor Benjamin can suspend me without due process!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You wanna play this game? Fine. I'm calling my brother. Let's see what's gonna happen." Cromwell stepped off to the side, yanking out his phone like he was drawing a sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar's fingers flew across the phone, tapping in the number with the precision of a man who had made this call more than once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His brother was a Deputy Mayor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his brother's father-in-law? A retired statesman from Kingston who used to hold one of the top seats in the country.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On top of that, his in-laws were still power players in Uswad's government, holding down key positions in national agencies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People like that didn't just bend the rules&mdash;they made them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This family network was the very foundation of Cromwell's ongoing power struggle with Benjamin Mitchell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five minutes after the call, a convoy of luxury sedans pulled up in formation like a presidential motorcade.</span></p><div class="pagination">
