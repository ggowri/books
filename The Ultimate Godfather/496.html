  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus quickly asked about the investigation into Jeremy's parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie provided a clear and accurate answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After some time gathering evidence, Josie had already uncovered most of the criminal activities involving Jeremy's parents. She was just about ready to initiate the disciplinary action against them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Marcus called, Josie was on the verge of announcing the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he hung up, Jeremy shot Marcus another mocking look. "Don't tell me you know people at Kingston BioFusion Pharmaceuticals. My parents are pillars of BioFusion Pharmaceuticals. Even Ms. Shelman treats them with respect. You think you have the power to bring them down?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled, "Your parents are under investigation for bribery, corruption, and abusing their positions. And there are major flaws in the products they were involved with. BioFusion Pharmaceuticals has already dismissed them. Honestly, I have no idea why you're still acting so arrogant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At these words, Kyle, Penny, and Jeremy froze, stunned into silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially Jeremy, who still wore a mocking smile. He stood tall and said with pride, "You're full of crap. My parents are just fine. How could they possibly be under investigation? Just recently, Ms. Shelman personally awarded them each a one-million-dollar bonus. You're just making things up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Jeremy's eyes, his parents were practically untouchable gods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had deep connections within BioFusion Pharmaceuticals, so there was no way what Marcus was saying could be true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as he finished speaking, his phone rang again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, it was his father calling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, what's going on? I'm in Solomia on a blind date. There's this guy named Marcus who says you're going to be suspended. When you have the chance, come to Solomia and teach him a lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy spoke with a mocking tone, still hoping his father would back him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as he finished speaking, the voice on the other end of the phone roared, "What that man said is true! Your mother and I just got notified. We've both been suspended, and the police are downstairs. We might be taken away. You need to keep your job at Golden Group. Your mother and I are counting on you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never imagined that his parents had truly been suspended and that they might even face criminal charges.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was worse, they were counting on him to get into Golden Group, but now he learned that his job was already gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blow was too much to bear. As he collapsed to the floor, Jeremy passed out cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jeremy, what's wrong? Don't scare us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle and Penny rushed to support him, frantically trying to wake him up. Eventually, Jeremy came to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My parents have been dismissed... my job is gone... I have nothing left!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeremy's first words upon waking were full of despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle and Penny stood frozen in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They turned to Marcus, eyes wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to contain himself, Kyle asked, "Who exactly are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, they finally understood that the young man in front of them was no ordinary person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm just me. What else would I be? I am a farmer's son, a middle school dropout, and an unemployed drifter," Marcus answered with a casual smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, there was a knock on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes turned toward the sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A middle-aged man in a suit, exuding a refined air, entered the room, flanked by waitstaff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you Mr. Prescott, the owner of Le Vieux Ch&acirc;teau?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle was the first to recognize the man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Clayton Prescott, the owner of the restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Running such a large establishment in such a prime location was no small feat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, Clayton had an even more significant identity. He was the brother-in-law of Benjamin, the mayor of Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Solomia, Clayton was a man with considerable influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His sister's husband was the mayor, so everyone respected him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, Clayton had entered the private room in person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without acknowledging Kyle, Penny, or Jeremy, he walked straight up to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bowed slightly, his expression full of respect. "Mr. Fitzgerald, your presence at Le Vieux Ch&acirc;teau brings great honor to our humble establishment. I apologize for not welcoming you properly. Please forgive me for the oversight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene left Kyle, Penny, Jeremy, and Shannon utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was this man the owner of the restaurant, but he was also the mayor's relative! And now, he was personally coming to the private room to pay his respects to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shock of this moment surpassed even the earlier one when Marcus had used a single phone call to have Jeremy's job offer canceled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon's eyes were wide, her gaze fixed on Marcus, and her thoughts were racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had once believed Marcus' claim of being a mere farmer's son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, even the mayor's relative was personally coming to pay his respects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that Marcus was not just a country bumpkin</span><span>!</span></p><div class="pagination">
