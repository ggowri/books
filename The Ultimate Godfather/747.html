  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Liam pulled aside the expert of the Swords Sect who had brought the news, whispering, "Tell everyone in the sect not to take any revenge against Marcus. This matter ends here. From now on, no one is to provoke Marcus or anyone close to him. Otherwise, it will bring catastrophic disaster to our Swords Sect. Do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The expert's eyes narrowed as if the Liam before him was unfamiliar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, Liam had been known for his explosive temper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fierce protectiveness of Swords Sect members was legendary throughout the </span><span>Ancient Martial Arts world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If anyone dared to harm someone from the Swords Sect, whether an elder or merely a junior disciple, Liam would fight them to the death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet now, Liam was giving such an order, contrary to his usual character.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So much so that the messenger asked for confirmation, "Patriarch, could you please repeat that? I'm not sure I heard correctly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam shot him a fierce glare, impatiently repeating what he'd just said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally convinced, the expert's heart trembled as he asked, "Patriarch, are we just going to let the deaths of our two great elders go unpunished? If the Swords Sect takes no action and word gets out, how will we maintain our standing in the Ancient Martial Arts world?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen up!" Liam's voice thundered. "Our Swords Sect started this conflict with Marcus. Your concern should be whether he'll turn his anger on our other members, not about seeking revenge. With his power, he could instantly wipe out our entire Swords Sect. Do you understand now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's face filled with shock as he stared at Liam in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Patriarch," he stammered, "are you saying that even you are no match for Marcus?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam recounted every detail of Marcus' battle with Nathan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's face showed pure astonishment after hearing the story. "Marcus is so young, yet incredibly powerful. In the world of Ancient Martial Arts, aside from those reclusive masters, I doubt anyone could stand against him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam nodded. "Now, do you understand my concerns?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man quickly nodded and retreated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam let out a heavy sigh, though rage still churned inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet he dared not show even a hint of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His original plan had been to invite Marcus and his group here to use them as pawns at the </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall space-time gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were supposed to be his stepping stones for exploring the gate's secrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After witnessing Marcus' power, Liam had to abandon that scheme.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew this seemingly peaceful young man would bring unimaginable consequences if provoked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't just Liam. Every expert above Ancient Martial Stage Seven had a hidden agenda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were all crafty veterans who had lived through samsara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after seeing Marcus' terrifying strength, they kept their mouths shut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially those who had mocked Marcus earlier</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>they now looked particularly uneasy, afraid he might come seeking retribution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the way of the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Power commanded respect! Only those with enough strength receive the recognition they deserve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus arrived, everyone had their reservations about him, and many didn't hesitate to mock him openly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, after Marcus had thoroughly dominated Nathan with his overwhelming power, they all fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did they no longer dare to disrespect Marcus, but their eyes now held a glimmer of admiration when they looked at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They finally understood why Ada ignored Nathan and went to greet Marcus upon her arrival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, who wouldn't want to curry favor with someone so powerful?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Patriarch, when shall we depart?" Marcus asked as he approached to face Liam, with Ada following close behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam's anger had nowhere to go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though seething inside, he had no choice but to suppress his rage when Marcus addressed him, forcing a smile as he replied, "The journey to the </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall space-time gate is long. We can set out after a brief rest!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded. "In that case, I'll wait for everyone outside the </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without warning, Marcus took Ada's hand right before everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada's delicate frame trembled slightly, a blush spreading across her beautiful face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could react, a terrifying spatial force erupted from Marcus' body, enveloping them both.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, as everyone watched in shock, Marcus and Ada vanished into thin air!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They disappeared without a trace as if they'd never been there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... what kind of incredible power is this? Where did Marcus go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd took a moment to recover. One of the expert warriors finally spoke up, his voice shaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others wore expressions of disbelief, their minds struggling to process what they'd witnessed. They'd never seen such a fantastic ability that could make people vanish on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be a Space-Time Scroll?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone ventured this guess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Space-Time Scrolls were magical treasures that could only be used once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This treasure allowed for instant teleportation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Space-Time Scrolls typically only worked for one person, and the teleportation distance never exceeded </span><span>620</span><span> </span><span>miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus had not only vanished himself but taken Ada with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This fact immediately ruled out the possibility of a Space-Time Scroll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it wasn't a scroll, what kind of incredible power allowed them to vanish instantly with others in tow?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam stood dumbfounded, never imagining Marcus would possess such an extraordinary ability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt relieved that he'd managed to keep his anger in check earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given this mystical power Marcus had just displayed, his true strength might be even more terrifying than when he fought Nathan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Against Marcus, he'd probably be dead in seconds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan's face turned ashen, his heart filled with rage and an overwhelming sense of defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only had Marcus publicly humiliated him, but he'd also whisked away the woman </span><span>he loved right before his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the chosen heir of the Caster family, this was his first taste of such failure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The experience left him questioning everything about himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was this the kind of humiliation that he, the proud heir of the Caster family, was destined to endure?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though bitter, Nathan had to admit that Marcus' display of power was beyond belief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one else could instantly vanish in the entire world of Ancient Martial Arts while carrying others along! It was unheard of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the legendary recluses he knew of probably couldn't achieve such a feat.</span></p><div class="pagination">
