  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Garrick's gaze was cold and unforgiving as he spoke with absolute arrogance. "My son taking an interest in your sister should be an honor for her. And yet, you had the audacity to cripple him? You've got some nerve."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered, "Tell me, how do you want to die? Should I have my men finish you off right now, or do you want to do it yourself? Your choice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words carried an undeniable sense of authority as if Marcus was already doomed, a helpless prey awaiting execution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled, unfazed, "What if I say I choose neither?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That single sentence sent a surge of fury through Garrick. His eyes darkened as he gritted his teeth. "Kid, looks like you don't know what's good for you. Since you're so eager to die, I'll make sure you regret that choice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he prepared to give the order, Morgana interrupted him, "Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Garrick's expression flickered with surprise as he turned to Morgana. "And what do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morgana stood her ground. "This is Solomia Institute of Technology. I won't allow you to cause trouble here. If you make a move, I'll call security."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had noticed a patrol team approaching and couldn't bear to watch Marcus face Garrick's men alone. Hoping to deter them, she played the only card she had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Garrick merely scoffed, "Security? This school? Let me tell you something&mdash;if I kill someone right here, your principal wouldn't even dare to say a word, let alone those useless guards."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he waved a hand at his men, signaling them to attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, the so-called security guards took one look at Garrick and quickly turned away, unwilling to interfere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morgana's face paled. She hadn't expected the school's security to be nothing more than decoration in front of Garrick's influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, dozens of Garrick's men surged forward, weapons in hand, their eyes filled with ruthless intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Garrick backing them, they had nothing to fear. Even if they killed Marcus, they knew Garrick would cover for them. And they didn't hold back&mdash;every strike aimed to kill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd gasped, watching in horror. They knew Marcus was in serious trouble. Their gazes toward Marcus were filled with a hint of sympathy. Nicole trembled, fear written all over her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take care of my sister." Marcus gently pushed Nicole toward Morgana. Morgana instinctively pulled Nicole close and took a step back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, two men lunged at Marcus, swinging metal rods straight at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't even bother dodging. Instead, he struck out with two quick punches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sickening thud echoed in the air. The two attackers let out agonized screams as they collapsed to the ground, their ribs shattered, blood dripping from their mouths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the others could react, two more experts rushed in from behind, daggers aimed at Marcus' back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smirked. In a split second, he spun and lashed out with a sweeping kick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His foot slammed into both their jaws with brutal force. The sound of bones shattering filled the air as the men crumpled to the ground, their faces a bloody mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of this happened in just a few seconds. And just like that, Garrick's men were already down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the brutal scene before them, the onlookers couldn't help but gasp in shock. No one had expected Marcus to be this formidable in a fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This guy is tougher than I thought. Be careful, all of you. Attack together&mdash;I want to see how long he can keep this up!" Garrick ordered his men, his expression darkening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected Marcus to be trained, but he wasn't worried. After all, he'd brought over fifty men, all hardened fighters, each armed and ready to kill without hesitation. In Garrick's mind, no matter how skilled Marcus was, there was no way he could take on so many opponents alone.</span></p><div class="pagination">
