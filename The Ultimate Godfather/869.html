Anything they didn't want the public to know would be erased instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Special Advisor to </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> military, Marcus' actions had to remain shrouded in secrecy. Naturally, the military would not allow him to appear in the public eye so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the onlookers, they were, after all, just a small group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once all their photos and videos were erased, even if they wanted to spread the news, it would only remain as hearsay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was how rumors were born.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It proved that even some so-called "rumors" contained a degree of truth&mdash;they were not simply fabricated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just that the evidence to prove them had already been wiped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Preston, Finley, and Aiden harbored immense hatred toward Marcus, but they were utterly powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had all been dismissed from their positions. They had nothing left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their current status, they no longer had the power to challenge Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their only option now was to take their pensions and live out the rest of their days in peace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they dared to provoke Marcus again, they might invite even greater disaster upon themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronald and the doctors from </span><span>Solomia</span><span> Hospital were scared out of their wits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronald never imagined that a simple business negotiation, representing </span><span>Solomia</span><span> Hospital to purchase patented special drugs from </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span>, would lead to such a massive crisis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, he felt immensely relieved that Marcus hadn't pursued him in the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had been constantly making things difficult for Jade earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, he discovered that Jade's boyfriend was someone as powerful as Marcus!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Ronald had known this from the start, he would never have dared to offend Jade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He understood all too well that in this world, the strong always ruled over the weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Marcus' influence, he never had to worry about anything&mdash;there were always people willing to take care of things for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, without even lifting a finger, Marcus had utterly destroyed Preston, Finley, and Aiden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And they didn't even have the chance to seek revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the true power of absolute strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus finally understood why so many people spent their entire lives chasing wealth and power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These two things had the ability to drive people mad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since all information about the incident was sealed, the events that took place at the restaurant's entrance did not cause any major waves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most people had no idea that such a dramatic event had unfolded right outside that restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, paid no attention to any of this. By now, he had already taken Jade to a barbecue joint for a meal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, Aiden had been harassing Jade at the banquet, leaving her no chance to enjoy her food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, she was starving. Seeing the sizzling, oil-dripping skewers in front of her, she couldn't resist taking a big bite.</span></p><div class="pagination">
