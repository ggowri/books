  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ewan and Quinton were instantly paralyzed with fear, their faces drained of color. Ewan, nearly on the verge of tears, begged for mercy, his voice trembling, "Hayden, please&mdash;let's talk this through. What did we do to offend you? Even if we're to die, let us die knowing why!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An icy chill emanated from Hayden as he stared at them coldly. His voice was harsh and unforgiving as he spoke, "You two should have kept your eyes wide open. Of all the people you could have wronged, you chose to mess with Mr. Fitzgerald, and dragged me into it. You deserve nothing but death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He paused for a moment, his gaze sharp and unwavering. "Mr. Fitzgerald is someone our boss, Blake, treats with the utmost respect. You two might not have understood that, but now you should. Do you get it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ewan and Quinton exchanged a look of stunned disbelief, their faces falling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They turned their eyes toward Marcus with expressions of pure shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had never in their wildest dreams imagined that this man&mdash;this seemingly ordinary person&mdash;held such a prestigious status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Axe Gang, which reigned over Kingston's criminal underworld, was one of the top five gangs in the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their leader, Blake, was not only feared but revered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fact that even someone of his caliber showed such deference to Marcus was mind-blowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hayden, please, we didn't know Mr. Fitzgerald held such a high position... Please, forgive us!" Quinton was practically in tears, shaking with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment he saw some of the Axe Gang's men draw knives, a gut-wrenching impulse surged in him to fall to his knees and beg for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hayden didn't even flinch at their desperate pleas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes were stone cold as he barked an order, "You've already messed up. Now pay the price!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without hesitation, two of the gang members, knives gleaming in the dim light, stepped forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sharp sound of blades slicing through the air echoed, followed by sickening thuds as both men's arms were hacked off at the elbows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ewan and Quinton screamed in agony, their voices echoing through the alley as blood sprayed from the severed limbs. The raw pain made their vision blur. They hadn't even processed what was happening before the knives fell again, cutting off their other arms in one swift motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ewan, his face pale with shock, nearly passed out from the excruciating pain, sweat pouring from his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before they could even comprehend the severity of their situation, Hayden, still emanating the chilling aura of authority, approached Marcus with an almost unnatural reverence. In an astonishing display of humility, he dropped to his knees, slapped himself hard across the face, and begged for forgiveness. "Mr. Fitzgerald... I didn't know who you were before, and I have insulted you. Please forgive me, I've been loyal to Axe Gang for years. It's taken me everything to rise to this position. Please, don't end my life for my ignorance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus, his expression calm and composed, simply smiled. "You still think I was just 'pretending' when I called your boss Blake?" he asked, his voice low and measured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hayden shook his head desperately, his eyes wide with regret. "I was blind, Mr. Fitzgerald. Please, don't hold it against me. I am deeply sorry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With each slap Hayden delivered to his own face, his features became more bruised and swollen. The pain was not just physical&mdash;it was a soul-crushing realization of his own inadequacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus waved his hand dismissively. "Alright. I'll spare you this time. But if something like this happens again, your boss will be involved, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A sense of relief washed over Hayden as if a great weight had been lifted from his shoulders. He scrambled to thank Marcus, kowtowing fervently. "Thank you, Mr. Fitzgerald. I will never make this mistake again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus simply gestured for him to rise. "From now on, don't take on jobs without properly vetting your targets. Do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hayden nodded fervently, muttering his gratitude as Marcus turned to leave. The sound of the sleek Aston Martin's engine roared to life, and the car sped off into the distance, leaving Hayden behind in a daze, still trembling with fear and awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Turning back to face Ewan and Quinton, whose limbs lay in grotesque heaps on the ground, Hayden's eyes glinted with bitter anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You two nearly ruined my life. If it weren't for Mr. Fitzgerald's generosity, I would've been dead by now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The words hit Ewan like a thunderclap, shaking him to his core. He could scarcely comprehend what he had just heard. Marcus, the man he had thought nothing of, was an untouchable figure&mdash;someone so far above him, it was laughable. He had always prided himself on being an outstanding member of the Tiger Fist Fighting Club, a former champion, but in the presence of someone like Marcus, he felt like a fool. Shannon, the woman he had been trying to impress, had always chosen Marcus over him, but he hadn't understood why until now. No amount of strength or wealth could ever match the power of Marcus' influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hayden, what should we do with them?" one of the gang members asked, looking at Ewan and Quinton with a mix of disgust and pity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hayden gave a cold smirk, his voice dripping with disdain. "Let them fend for themselves. Let them rot here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Hayden turned on his heel, signaling his men to follow as they left the scene, the sound of their footsteps fading into the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only the two mutilated men remained, left to die slowly in the gutter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For a long time, they screamed for help, but it wasn't until hours later that a passerby heard their cries and called an ambulance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, it was too late for their arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The doctors could do little more than try to stabilize them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But with the time lost, their arms couldn't be saved, and they would live the rest of their lives as shadows of their former selves&mdash;crippled by their own stupidity and pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Marcus had already arrived at the Solomia Hospital's recovery wing.</span></p><div class="pagination">
