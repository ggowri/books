  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Camy, look, that guy actually came to gamble on stones."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jennifer mocked, "Even though I don't know much about gambling on stones, I can tell that the raw material he picked is of extremely poor quality. He's really stupid."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jennifer, didn't you forget? He couldn't even afford 50 million just now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think he should know that other raw materials are of better quality, but unfortunately, he can't afford them," Camila said with a light smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While speaking, Camila also secretly glanced at Truman from a distance, her eyes filled with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although this raw material is of poor quality, it was chosen by our&nbsp;stone picker from Grand Fortune, so it must be extraordinary. How about this, I'll give you a discount, 60 million. If you agree, you pay, and this stone is yours," the staff member said with a smile, his words somewhat exaggerated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, this stone had been in their market for a long time and had previously been used as a stool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't want to waste it, so he put the stone on display, waiting for some fool to buy it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The staff member saw that Marcus wanted to buy it, so he made up a lie and raised the price to an absurd level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sixty&nbsp;million wasn't much, but being able to sell an eyesore of a stone for that price&nbsp;would still make&nbsp;that staff&nbsp;quite satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll take it," Marcus agreed without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the raw material appeared to be of poor quality on the surface, Marcus, using his X-ray vision, saw that its interior was quite full. The energy crystal inside was of extremely high quality, even surpassing the crystal Diana used to modify guns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the prices of energy crystals in the Southern Market, the energy crystal in this piece of material was worth at least ten billion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcus bought&nbsp;it for 60 million, it would be a sure profit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the eyes of others, Marcus was simply a big fool, especially the staff member, who almost couldn't help but laugh out loud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The staff member thought, "This guy is really stupid. It's just an ordinary stone, can't </span><span>he see that? Since he's stupid, don't blame me for taking advantage of him. Gambling on stones always involves risks. Adults have to pay for their own choices,&nbsp;so&nbsp;it's not my fault."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Camy, look. He didn't buy the 50 million </span><span>crystal</span><span>, but he's going to spend 60 million on such a shabby&nbsp;stone. He's really brainless," Jennifer couldn't help but mock with a laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I knew it. He just couldn't afford the other raw materials, so he could only buy this one to show off," Camila said, crossing her arms, looking forward to seeing Marcus' disappointed expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only Camila and Jennifer but everyone else present also laughed sarcastically, thinking that Marcus had been taken advantage of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some even tried to stop&nbsp;Marcus, but Marcus just smiled gratefully at them and still paid the 60 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The 60 million included the cost of opening the stone and the fine polishing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the gamblers had purchased a certain amount of raw material, the merchants would open the stones together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, it was Truman's turn to choose raw material.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To pick out better material, he had spent 20 billion to hire Giles, drawing envious glances from many people present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he didn't directly ask Giles to help choose, but instead walked&nbsp;to a piece of raw material that looked of good quality. He asked Giles, "I've just learned a little about gambling on stones. Mr. Hansen, what do you think of this&nbsp;piece?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes were on the raw material Truman had chosen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people expressed their approval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Dupont,&nbsp;indeed, has a keen eye. This piece is definitely one of the best in this place," Camila said excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Dupont is really amazing, much better than that guy," Jennifer also expressed her approval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jennie, comparing that guy to Mr. Dupont is an insult to Mr. Dupont," Camila said reproachfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Truman was Camila's&nbsp;dream lover.&nbsp;She&nbsp;could&nbsp;stand Truman was&nbsp;compared to a poor guy like Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone could see the extraordinariness of that piece, so Giles naturally didn't doubt it and even praised Truman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Truman bought the piece for 20 billion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to estimate, the energy crystal in that piece was worth at least 50 billion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, may I ask why you didn't choose Mr. Dupont's piece? I believe 20 billion is not a problem for you," Cooke asked Marcus, somewhat puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus casually replied, "Although that piece looks good on the surface and contains a large volume of energy crystal, there are cracks on the crystal, which could&nbsp;affect the quality. In my opinion, spending 20 billion on such a piece can only guarantee the cost.&nbsp;So, it&nbsp;doesn't meet my criteria."</span></p><div class="pagination">
