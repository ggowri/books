        <h1>Chapter 653 Terminate the Contract</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Solomia, there weren't many people whose annual income reached billions. It was a rarity, a feat that commanded awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one expected that such a figure would turn out to be their high school classmate, sitting casually among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as for Marcus, the group only thought he was bluffing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sean, who had been vocal in their chat group earlier, sneered, "Marcus, we're all classmates here. Can you stop exaggerating for once? I know you're jealous of Jenson's wealth, but even if you want to talk big, at least stay within reason. You've practically blown this nonsense to the moon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! We haven't seen him in years, and now Marcus is out here spinning tales. Jenson's way out of his league, and yet he's acting like he can take him down. It's ridiculous!" another chimed in with a scoff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson, smug and unbothered, gestured for everyone to settle down. With hands in his pockets, he shot a disdainful glance at Marcus. "Marcus, I'll give you a chance. Go ahead, make good on your big words. If you can't, then do us all a favor and shut that filthy mouth of yours. We're here for a reunion, not to listen to your nonsense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! If you're so capable, prove it to us. I'd love to see how you plan to make my husband lose everything!" sneered Vivian, her tone dripping with sarcasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, unfazed, rose from his seat. "Give me a few minutes. I'll make a call," he said, heading out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once outside, he dialed the head of Sync Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief discussion, Marcus confirmed that Jenson was indeed one of Sync Group's suppliers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the scale of his operations was nowhere near the grand claims he had made.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The annual supply volume was about five billion dollars, yielding an estimated profit of 1.5 billion, substantial, but not earth-shattering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Jenson wasn't even one of Sync Group's key suppliers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus made a swift decision to terminate the contract with Jenson immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The executive on the other end agreed and responded promptly, "Mr. Fitzgerald, we've recently had issues with the quality of his latest batch of components. If our investigation confirms negligence, we can deduct his last six months' supply payments and seize the performance bond. That amounts to about five billion dollars in total."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do it," Marcus ordered firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir. Consider it done."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus returned to the room, Jenson smirked at him. "Done making your little call? You said you'd ruin me, yet here I am, perfectly fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, Jenson, you didn't seriously believe his nonsense, did you? There's no way a single phone call could take down someone as wealthy as you. It's laughable!" Sean scoffed, his gaze dripping with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right, honey," Vivian chimed in, leaning over to place a piece of food into Jenson's mouth with exaggerated affection. "Why waste your breath on someone who's clearly delusional? Look at who he hangs out with. Of course, he's just as pathetic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie, who had been silent throughout, continued to observe quietly. Unlike the others, she refrained from mocking Marcus outright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was also snobbish, and she only came here because of Jenson's rumored billions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had hoped to form a closer relationship with him, perhaps even something romantic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But seeing how devoted he was to Vivian, she knew her chances were slim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Jenson wasn't an option, then maybe Marcus could be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had casually dropped 650 million dollars on the jewelry store. Who wouldn't be tempted by a man like that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, maybe we should just leave..." whispered Chad, unable to bear the ridicule any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even he had his doubts about Marcus' bold claims.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could one phone call really bring down someone as powerful as Jenson? It sounded absurd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five minutes," Marcus replied calmly. "You'll know soon enough." His confidence remained unwavering, as if he already held all the cards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hah! Fine. Five minutes!" Jenson barked, his voice dripping with contempt. "If you fail, you'll apologize to me in front of everyone. Understood?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, he was determined to strip Chad of any dignity and make sure Marcus' name was dragged through the mud for good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room erupted into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sean chimed in gleefully, "Jenson, this is a sure win for you. We'll all be waiting to see him eat his words!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several others joined in, their mockery growing louder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, siding with Jenson, the man with billions to his name, seemed the safest and most rewarding choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chad, of all people, you put your faith in this loudmouth? Just wait and see how humiliating it'll be for the both of you!"</span></p></div>
