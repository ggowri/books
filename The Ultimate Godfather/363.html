        <h1>Chapter 362 Be Alone in One Room</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zane and Easton had both won the Crankhurst Karate Championship, and their skills were truly terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even seven or eight ordinary people could not get close to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, despite teaming up, they were easily defeated by Marcus in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This outcome was hard for Terry and Charlotte to accept. They stared blankly, unable to comprehend what had just happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, Mr. Fitzgerald is amazing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace clapped her hands and cheered excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to the narrow space, Marcus did not dare use too much force. Otherwise, with the two strikes he had just delivered, Zane and Easton would have either died or been left crippled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Zane and Easton got up from the floor, Marcus had already returned to his seat and lit a cigarette, puffing out the smoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Crankhurst Karate champions are nothing special," he said, looking at them with an indifferent expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zane and Easton exchanged a glance, their eyes filled with frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Easton spoke up, saying that the space here was too small to fight properly, and suggested they take it to the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Easton Griffin, Mr. Fitzgerald has already shown mercy. Do not push him further," Benjamin intervened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "I have seen Marcus effortlessly kill the cyborg Gibson from the Hudson family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gibson had been enhanced with powerful mechanical implants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zane and Easton are just regular humans. Even together, they would not have been a match for Gibson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could they possibly defeat Marcus?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Easton was about to speak again, but Terry stopped him. "Enough. We, the Crankhurstians, can accept defeat. Since we are no match, there is no need to stay any longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Terry stood up and bowed to Benjamin. "Thank you for your hospitality, Mayor Benjamin. We will take our leave now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then led Zane, Easton, and Charlotte out of the Mitchell Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they left, Grace's face immediately lit up with a happy smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These Crankhurstians really are arrogant. If Mr. Fitzgerald had not shut them down, they might have said even worse things tonight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace looked at Marcus, smiling brightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, you were so cool just now. I want to learn martial arts from you. Will you take me as your disciple?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace blinked her big, sparkling eyes, her face full of anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled, "If you want to learn, of course I will teach you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing his response, Grace's face lit up with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus thought, "After recovering from leukemia, she has become much livelier and more energetic, just like a girl her age should be."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grace, stop bothering Mr. Fitzgerald while he is eating. We can talk later," Benjamin scolded her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace stuck out her tongue and stopped talking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mayor Benjamin, I have noticed that Ms. Mitchell has exceptional potential. If you do not mind, I can guide her in martial arts," Marcus said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his cultivation grew, Marcus had gained a deeper understanding of Ancient Martial Art.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also developed the ability to assess others' potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He did not know how this ability came to him, but after his cultivation broke through the Ancient Martial Stage Five, this ability just manifested on its own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Grace had once had leukemia, she was indeed a great candidate for Ancient Martial Art training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is what Mr. Fitzgerald said true?" Grace asked, both surprised and delighted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course," Marcus nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, do you remember? My childhood dream was to be a female warrior. Looks like I am really suited for it! Hehe..." Grace laughed happily, looking at Marcus. "So, Mr. Fitzgerald, when will you start teaching me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you are ready, we can start now," Marcus replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace's big, beautiful eyes sparkled. "That is great! You can teach me after you finish eating."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded, "We will need a quiet place, somewhere we will not be disturbed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace did not hesitate and said, "How about my room? No one will bother us there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Marcus finished eating, Grace led him to her room and locked the door behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sweet, girlish fragrance filled the air as soon as they entered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace's room was about 20 square meters, cozy and cute, with typical girl decorations&mdash;stuffed animals, anime posters, and various figurines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, we can start now. My parents will not interrupt us," Grace said eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at the locked door and suddenly seemed to realize something, her face turning red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "This is the first time I have been alone with a man in a room, even though Mr. Fitzgerald is here to teach me martial arts. Still, it makes me feel a little nervous."</span></p></div>
