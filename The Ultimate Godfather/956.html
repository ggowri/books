        <h1>Chapter 897 Falling Out-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maximilian's face twisted into a look of utter disbelief, his head pounding as if he'd been struck by lightning.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He never thought this would happen. Getting fired? That wasn't even on his radar.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the worst part? It all happened with just one phone call from Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was hard to believe. He couldn't take his eyes off Marcus, who now seemed more </span><span>like a threat than a colleague.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fiona, noticing the sudden change in his demeanor, raised an eyebrow. "What's wrong, honey? You look like you've seen a ghost."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before she could finish her sentence, Maximilian slapped her hard across the face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The force of the hit made Fiona stumble, her already swollen cheek turning an even deeper shade of red.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What the hell is going on? Why'd you hit me?" Fiona asked, completely confused, her voice shaky.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I got fired by the CEO&mdash;all because of you, you stupid woman! If you hadn't gone and pissed off that lady, none of this would have happened! And I wouldn't be out of a job!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maximilian's voice was thick with fury, his hands clenched into fists as if he wanted to punch something&mdash;anything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His entire career and financial security were tied to his role as the executive vice president at </span><span>SiliconWave</span><span> Technologies.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now, all of that had come crashing down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was clear: Maximilian and Fiona were a perfect match&mdash;both were toxic, and neither knew when to back off.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they say, misery loves company.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This whole mess started because Maximilian had made a move on Kiera, and now he was trying to blame Fiona.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was shameless, taking blame-shifting to a whole new level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fiona, however, had had enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her expression grew icy. "You're the one who tried to rape her! I stepped in to protect you, and now you're blaming me? Have you lost your mind?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Shut up, you fool. Who asked you to speak up for me? Look at you&mdash;fat and ugly, just like a pig. I haven't been into you for ages. If it weren't for the kids, I would've divorced you a long time ago. You're still pretending to be my wife?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Being stuck with an idiot like you is the reason I've got nothing left! From now on, I never want to see you again. You make me sick!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maximilian snapped, letting all his pent-up frustration spill out in an outburst.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he had already admitted, he had lost interest in Fiona long ago, and had been sneaking around with other women.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, this foolish woman had no clue and still thought she was the queen of the household.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maximilian had had enough. If it weren't for the kids, he'd have left her in the dust.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fiona, feeling utterly betrayed, couldn't hold back her tears. "You ungrateful bastard! Who do you think gave you kids? Who's been there, silently supporting your career? Now that I've gained some weight and don't look like I used to, you start treating me like this? Maximilian, can you even look at yourself?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And it's your fault I got an STD from your affairs! You have the nerve to call me fat? I'm going to kill you today!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fiona had completely snapped.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every bit of frustration she had been bottling up came rushing out as she threw herself </span><span>at Maximilian, fists flying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The scene was a shock to everyone nearby, who had never imagined this seemingly perfect couple would come apart so violently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Kiera, watching from a distance, couldn't help but shake her head, her face twisting into a look of utter disdain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You got anything else? If not, let's go. This dogfight is starting to bore me."</span></p></div>
