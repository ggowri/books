  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aquila ignored Marcus' attack once again, closing in on him with crushing force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aquila roared, unleashing another blast of black flames from his mouth, this time laced with a horrifying, corrosive liquid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the flames enveloped Marcus' body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This attack was deadly. Even someone at the peak of Ancient Martial Art Stage Seven would struggle to resist it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what made it even more lethal wasn't just the flames. It was the liquid mixed within them&mdash;poisonous and corrosive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For an expert in Ancient Martial Art, this was a death sentence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Celestial Reversal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't bother trying to fight back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He released the Celestial Reversal technique, and in an instant, the terrifying black flames and corrosive liquid were reflected back toward Aquila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Aquila was still agile, his massive frame and larger target made him vulnerable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rebound attack caught him off guard, and his body was immediately consumed by the black flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deadly liquid poured over him, spreading across his body like a nightmare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aquila let out a tortured scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The combination of the corrosive liquid and the black flames burned away large chunks of his flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His skin sizzled, and green blood oozed from the open wounds, sending a foul, rancid stench into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes sharpened, and the Heavenly Circle Diagram flared to life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lines of intricate runes formed in his palm, cascading down and enveloping Aquila's </span><span>body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The formation was powerful and highly restrictive, quickly binding Aquila in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how hard he struggled, he couldn't break free. He could only watch helplessly as the corrosive liquid devoured his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You insignificant worm, you should have died long ago!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aquila howled, his body cracking and snapping as if ready to explode.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force of his fury twisted the lines of the Heavenly Circle Diagram.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a deafening explosion, the formation shattered, and Aquila launched himself toward Marcus in a berserk attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One massive claw swiped at him, slashing through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus countered with a fist ray, but the impact forced him to stagger back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the same moment, Aquila opened his enormous jaws and lunged at Marcus with terrifying speed, aiming to swallow him whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus dodged with a quick sidestep, narrowly avoiding the attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, before Aquila could react, Marcus' hand shot out, seizing Aquila's wrist. Devouring Power surged from his palm, erupting into Aquila's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aquila's face contorted with shock and pain as he tried to break free, but he felt his energy draining rapidly, as though a dam had broken inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His vision </span><span>blurred,</span><span> his strength faded. In a matter of moments, his frantic struggles ceased, and his once-burning rage turned into empty, glassy-eyed despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Devouring Power intensified, and Aquila's massive muscles began to shrink, his bones cracking back into their original shape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within moments, his hulking form returned to its normal state. His body collapsed to the ground, twitching violently as his life force drained away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got to be kidding me. I've devoured every ounce of energy in your body, and you're still alive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus stared at Aquila's twitching form on the ground, disbelief flickering across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until now, anyone who had been hit by his Devouring Power had turned into nothing more than a dried-out husk&mdash;no exceptions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet this Aquila... somehow, wasn't dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mutants were truly terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How... How could you possibly drain my energy? What the hell are you?" Aquila's voice trembled with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a mutant, he had always believed his energy control was beyond anything ordinary, something grotesque.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after Marcus had drained him, he felt like a child playing with fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't deserve to know," Marcus sneered coldly. Then, with a sharp edge to his voice, he demanded, "Where is Josie?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aquila, shaking, managed to croak, "You've slaughtered everyone here. Your woman might be the only one left alive. Why are you still asking me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' brow furrowed. A burst of flame erupted from him, engulfing Aquila's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A howl of agony ripped through the air, and in moments, Aquila was nothing but ash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second glance, Marcus reached out with his mind, sweeping the entire </span><span>Black Hawk Legion headquarters with his spiritual senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't take long for him to pinpoint Josie's location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow Step activated. Marcus moved like a blur, heading straight for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Josie remained bound to a pillar in the courtyard, her stunning face etched with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The constant explosions from outside told her that Marcus was undoubtedly engaged in a deadly battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Josie, are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a familiar voice reached her ears. Her eyes flickered with hope, and she quickly looked up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of Marcus walking toward her, step by step, sent a rush of disbelief through her. She could barely believe her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus... is it really you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie's voice trembled, the weight of her fear making it hard to trust her senses. She thought she must be hallucinating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's me," Marcus said simply, nodding as multiple beams of destructive energy shot out, slicing through the ropes that bound her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Relief flooded through him when he saw she was still alive. Without thinking, he pulled her into his arms, his heart swelling with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus... I was so scared... so scared I'd never see you again. Now that you're here... I'm so happy..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears streamed down Josie's face as she sobbed, overwhelmed by the sheer relief of being reunited with him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
