  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Marcus was dressed casually, the sales assistant, Elena Gomez, at the jewelry store was very attentive and took her time explaining things to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a charming smile, she said, "Sir, this necklace is crafted from the world's finest sapphires. It's called Tears of the Angel&mdash;a truly stunning piece, dazzling like the stars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Recently, it went viral online, and it's been sought after by socialites all over the world. Because it's handmade, it's produced in limited quantities, and there's often a waiting list for it. How about this&mdash;if you're interested, let me check with my manager to see if we have any in stock."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled and said, "I'd like to buy one of the Tears of the Angel necklaces. Please check with the manager for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elena smiled back. "Sir, I really envy the woman who will receive this gift. Please wait here for a moment while I ask the manager." With that, she headed to the back office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as people in the store heard that someone was buying a Tears of the Angel necklace, they turned their attention to Marcus. The reason was simple. While the necklace was extremely popular, its price&mdash;18.88 million Uswadian coins&mdash;was far from affordable for most people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, most of the customers in the store probably didn't have that kind of money. Everyone was curious to see who could afford such an extravagant item. When they saw how young Marcus was, many of them cast envious glances in his direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A short while later, Elena returned, this time accompanied by a tall, elegant woman in professional attire. The name tag on her chest clearly read "Natalie Vance, Store Manager."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Vance, this gentleman is interested in buying the Tears of the Angel," Elena said, pointing toward Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie's gaze shifted toward Marcus, and when she saw him, her expression froze for a moment. Then, in surprise, she said, "Marcus, is it really you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing his name, Marcus looked up and followed her gaze. To his shock, the store manager was none other than his high school classmate, Natalie. They hadn't seen each other since graduation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, Natalie had been the class beauty, admired by countless boys, including a younger, shy Marcus. He had been drawn to her beauty and had gathered the courage to confess his feelings, only to be cruelly rejected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason? Marcus wasn't particularly good-looking, and his family was poor&mdash;one of the few rural kids in the class, often looked down upon by others. At the time, Natalie was not only smart and beautiful but also the object of admiration for many boys.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never gave Marcus a second thought. Not only did she reject him, but she also said some hurtful, insulting words that left Marcus feeling humiliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That rejection affected him deeply, leading to a period of self-doubt and even causing his grades to drop, ultimately preventing him from passing the SAT. Since then, they hadn't crossed paths except for a brief exchange in a WhatsApp group a few years ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, seeing Marcus now, after all these years, was a complete surprise. What shocked Natalie even more was that Marcus was here to buy the store's most expensive item&mdash;Tears of the Angel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, what a coincidence. I'm here to buy some jewelry," Marcus said with a casual smile. All these years later, there was no longer any excitement in meeting the girl who had once been his crush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard you're looking to buy the Tears of the Angel?" Natalie asked, looking Marcus up and down with a hint of judgment in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, do you still have any left in stock?" Marcus asked calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie replied, "There's one available. It just arrived from Feldoria this morning. But at 18.88 million, do you think you can afford it? I know your family's situation, Marcus. Your parents are farmers. How much can they possibly earn from farming each year?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, Marcus, we haven't seen each other in years. Don't you think it's time to face reality? Stop dreaming like you did back in school, thinking you can reach for something that's out of your league."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tone was condescending, and her words were loud enough for others to overhear. Many of the people in the store turned their attention to them, eager to see how the situation would unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I knew it," one of the customers whispered. "There's no way someone could just walk in and </span><span>buy</span><span> Tears of the Angel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone sneered, "Yeah, when he came in, I could tell he didn't look like a wealthy person. So his parents are farmers? And now he's trying to buy a necklace worth millions? Talk about wishful thinking."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One echoed, "Some people are so fake. I bet he's just here to show off on Facebook. I bet that's the only reason he's here."</span></p><div class="pagination">
