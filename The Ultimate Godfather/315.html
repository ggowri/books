  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon couldn't help saying to Marcus, "Mr. Fitzgerald, I'm curious. You only met us once. How do you know all this? Do you have X-ray vision? It's ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Little did he know, his sarcastic words were actually true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus did have X-ray vision, which was a reward when he broke through Stage One of Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a one-of-a-kind skill unmatched by anyone else in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even those with superior strength or skills could never gain such an extraordinary ability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With this vision, Marcus could effortlessly see through anyone's body as if they were transparent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He can check everyone's physical condition at will without any medical equipment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His observation was far clearer than all the advanced medical equipment in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Robert knew that Marcus had cured patients with late-stage cancer,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Robert was a little incredulous when he saw Marcus casually diagnosing Mike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Robert thought that Marcus was trying to scare Mike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, as Jordon said, Marcus met them for the first time, and they hadn't been sitting here for more than five minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How could he see Mike's illness?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This seemed far too far-fetched!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade had the same idea as Robert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't think that there was something wrong with Mike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grandpa, this is getting ridiculous. Let's don't waste any more time with him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mike scoffed, his tone dripping with mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After that, his eyes fell on Robert, and he smiled, "Thank you, Professor Cooper, for your hospitality. Today's competition is over. I'll concede victory to Mr. Fitzgerald. I can't compete with such people. Goodbye!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, he got up with Jordon and walked towards outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Three days from now will be the peak of the cancer cell activity. Avoid alcohol at all costs, or your life may truly be in danger,"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Mike and Jordon left the room, Marcus said behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mike and Jordon turned back briefly, their expressions full of ridicule.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mike turned to Marcus and said, "Sorry, I'm going to a cocktail party tonight. There's no way I'm skipping the drinks. Let's see what happens if I drink."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After that, Mike and Jordon left and slammed the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Apologies, Mr. Fitzgerald. Westoners can be quite arrogant by nature. Please don't take offense," Robert said apologetically after they left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus waved his hand carelessly and said, "Now that they're gone, I'm leaving."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then he rose to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, please wait a moment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Robert quickly stopped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is there anything else?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I wonder if what Mr. Fitzgerald said to Mike is true?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade perked up with interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course, it's true." Marcus laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Robert and Jade were both stunned, their expressions mixed with doubt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Was there really anyone in this world who could see a person's illness with the naked eye?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More importantly, what Marcus saw was cancer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even in the late stages, cancer could be notoriously difficult to detect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many patients only discovered it when it was too late for treatment, having missed the critical window for intervention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>According to Marcus, Mike's cancer was obviously in its early stages, and it was a very special kind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This type of cancer was difficult to discover with the most advanced equipment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Did Marcus really possess some sort of supernatural ability?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"His cancer cells are very special. Although they are small now, they may be life-threatening once they are stimulated by external stimuli, such as excessive anger, drinking, and smoking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If he drinks a lot tonight, his life will be in danger," Marcus added and stepped out of Robert's house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By four o'clock in the afternoon, the sun was beginning to set.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus decided to postpone his investigation of the arms port until tomorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as he got back to the hotel, there was a surge of Numinous Energy that didn't belong to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made Marcus frown slightly, and he thought to himself, "It seems that the Numinous Energy swallowed from the Elder Dupont of the Astral Serpent Order the day before yesterday is out of control, and it must be refined early!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus returned to his room and began practicing Timeless Warrior's Grimoire and refining the Numinous Energy within him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
