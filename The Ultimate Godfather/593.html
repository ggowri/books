  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our Darian Logistics Company has all sorts of formalities. Why are you stopping us from starting our business? Do you believe that I will call the police to arrest you now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiera walked forward as </span><span>she</span><span> </span><span>glanced over at the people from the Rising Logistics Company and asked coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a bang, Gary Payton, the general manager from the Rising Logistics Company, slapped Kiera across the face and said viciously, "Bitch, am I being too nice to you? Who are you to talk here? The Rising Logistics Company sets all the rules in the entire </span><span>Solomia</span><span> logistics industry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Darian Logistics Company had just broken the rules by openly reducing transportation costs when it started business, causing our Rising Logistics Company to suffer a downturn in business. We're just upholding justice, okay?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you still </span><span>wanna</span><span> call the police? Why don't you ask who the people behind our Rising Logistics Company are? You can call the police, and I'll see if the police dare to arrest me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary was so arrogant that his statement was immediately supported by the people behind him, who were all from other logistics companies in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>. As soon as Gary said so, these people followed him at the drop of a hat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They are there to stop Darian Logistics Company from opening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was simply because Darian Logistics Company caused a huge stir in the logistics industry before it even opened for business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was popular with many customers because of its advanced business philosophy, formal transportation rules, and reasonable pricing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Rising Logistics Company's customers were among them, which led to a significant decline in its business volume.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The company, which had monopolized eighty percent of </span><span>Solomia's</span><span> logistics business, began to suffer from a business crisis for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary, of course, would not allow such a company that threatened his business to exist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gary, you've gone too far. We can play fair, but you are taking a violent way to stop my logistic company from opening. To be honest, we've got people behind us as well, and I'm just working for Mr. Fitzgerald. If you have to keep being arrogant, think about the consequences first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darian said indifferently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus could see that Darian had bruises on his face, which meant that he had been beaten as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made Marcus feel furious in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't be more familiar with Rising Logistics Company, which was the largest logistics company in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had operations all over </span><span>Solomia</span><span> and several neighboring cities, making it a leading company in the logistics industry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in the whole of </span><span>Uswad</span><span>, it could be ranked in the top ten logistics companies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Golden Group mainly depended on the Rising Logistics Company for the transportation of its goods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the Rising Logistics Company was the best in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>, it had a monopoly effect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, not only did they set their prices arbitrarily, but their service was also quite poor, with basically no after-sales guarantee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Customers had to take the risk of loss and damage, and they were arrogant to the core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason why the Rising Logistics Company could form a monopoly in </span><span>Solomia</span><span> without any other logistics company competing with it was because the owner behind it was Tim Burton, son of William Burton, the current director of the Road Transport Bureau in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William helped the Rising Logistics Company by using his position to support it and gave it various facilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even allowed many vehicles from the Rising Logistics Company to have their tolls reduced on the highway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, the transportation costs of the Rising Logistics Company would be significantly reduced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of decreasing the cost of transportation, the Rising Logistics Company raised the price several times over the past three years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a monopolistic company, so the clients could only hold their tongues.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had no second choice but the Rising Logistics Company, so they could barely pay the high logistics fees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Tim backing them up, the Rising Logistics Company had frequently suppressed some of the smaller local logistics companies, and they wouldn't even allow new </span><span>logistics companies to start up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, what happened to the Darian Logistics Company had been seen many times in the logistics industry in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Darian remained stubborn, a sarcastic smile appeared on Gary's face. He asked, "Mr. Fitzgerald? Why haven't I ever heard of this guy? Who is Mr. Fitzgerald? Do you think you can scare me just by randomly mentioning a loser?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me tell you, any logistic company in </span><span>Solomia</span><span> that wants to start up has to get permission from the Rising Logistics Company. Guys, go ahead and smash this company!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Gary waved his hand. Hundreds of men with weapons swarmed behind him and tried to break into the Darian Logistics Company and smash things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darian, Ramona, and Kiera looked irritated, trying to stop them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, they were beaten up by Gary and others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The commotion here attracted a crowd of onlookers to gather around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of Darian Logistics Company's clients were included, and they were looking at Gary and others furiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary's behavior was so arrogant, but even though they were outraged, no one dared to say anything and mess with the Rising Logistics Company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Darian, how dare you struggle? I'll kill you today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darian hugged Gary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary's eyes showed indifference as he picked up an iron bar and was going to slam it down towards Darian's head.</span></p><div class="pagination">
