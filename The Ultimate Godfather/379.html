Still trying to leave? Do you think you can get away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Randy, let's take this bitch to the hotel right now so you can bang her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another young man sneered as he spoke, reaching out to seize Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before he could get close to Grace, Marcus punched him squarely in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man screamed in pain and was knocked to the ground instantly, his two front teeth falling!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This scene made Randy and the others' faces darken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Randy said, "You think you can be the hero saving the damsel? You're way off. Guys hit him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Randy's words, the young men swung their fists and attacked Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But they were no match for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus sneered and quickly knocked them all down with punches and kicks, leaving them screaming and writhing in pain!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Randy looked upset, and it seemed his expression toward Marcus had changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hadn't expected this quiet guy to be so strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get on your knees and apologize to Grace!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus looked at Randy with a chilling gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Randy was scared, he still showed his tough side in front of Grace. "You want me to kneel? Dream on. If you have the guts, come at me. I'll fight you one-on-one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't hesitate and kicked Randy's knee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Randy cried out in pain and couldn't help but fall to his knees!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How dare you force me to kneel! Do you know who I am?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Randy looked at Marcus with extreme coldness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As one of the Deleon family, wherever he went, he was always praised and admired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, this man dared to make him kneel, which made Randy want to kill Marcus!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Slap!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Randy finished speaking, Marcus slapped him across the face, leaving Randy dazed. "Why so many words? Didn't you hear me? Apologize!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Apologize my foot..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Randy still refused to back down, and Marcus slapped him again, knocking out Randy's teeth and causing blood to flow continuously!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm giving you one more chance. Apologize!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus spoke coldly.</span></p><div class="pagination">
