He was relentless!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Call the police? Do you think just because your dad is the mayor of Solomia, you can have the police arrest me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't you know who my dad is? Besides, my cousin is Oliver, the Battle God of Uswad. He's currently on a mission in Solomia. If you call the police, I don't think any officer would dare to arrest me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Randy laughed arrogantly, pride shining in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace looked displeased, biting her lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Randy came from a powerful background.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was one of the Deleon family, known as Uswad's number one family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His father was the mayor of Solariae, and his mother held an important position there as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His cousin was Oliver, the renowned Battle God of Uswad, known as the youngest general in Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A series of prestigious backgrounds made Randy's life extraordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace was Benjamin's daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she knew their family didn't have the deep connections like Randy's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her father, Benjamin, was a top graduate of Kingston University and had pursued a career in public service after graduation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With his outstanding abilities and hardworking spirit, he gradually rose to become the mayor of Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But even so, their family couldn't compare to Randy's powerful lineage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Randy's earlier claim that no one would dare arrest him was not an exaggeration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Randy, what exactly do you want to do to stop bothering me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace had no choice but to ask Randy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Randy looked Grace up and down, especially lingering on her ample chest, and said, "Unless you agree to spend the night with me, I promise I won't bother you anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jerk!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace cursed Randy angrily and then took Marcus' hand and said, "Mr. Fitzgerald, let's go. Don't pay any attention to this jerk!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, before they could leave, Randy and several other young men blocked their path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of them sneered, "Hey bitch, didn't you hear what Randy said? Still trying to leave? Do you think you can get away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Randy, let's take this bitch to the hotel right now so you can bang her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another young man sneered as he spoke, reaching out to seize Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before he could get close to Grace, Marcus punched him squarely in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man screamed in pain and was knocked to the ground instantly, his two front teeth falling!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This scene made Randy and the others' faces darken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Randy said, "You think you can be the hero saving the damsel? You're way off. Guys hit him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Randy's words, the young men swung their fists and attacked Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But they were no match for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus sneered and quickly knocked them all down with punches and kicks, leaving them screaming and writhing in pain!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Randy looked upset, and it seemed his expression toward Marcus had changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hadn't expected this quiet guy to be so strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get on your knees and apologize to Grace!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus looked at Randy with a chilling gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Randy was scared, he still showed his tough side in front of Grace. "You want me to kneel? Dream on. If you have the guts, come at me. I'll fight you one-on-one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't hesitate and kicked Randy's knee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Randy cried out in pain and couldn't help but fall to his knees!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How dare you force me to kneel! Do you know who I am?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Randy looked at Marcus with extreme coldness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As one of the Deleon family, wherever he went, he was always praised and admired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, this man dared to make him kneel, which made Randy want to kill Marcus!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Slap!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Randy finished speaking, Marcus slapped him across the face, leaving Randy dazed. "Why so many words? Didn't you hear me? Apologize!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Apologize my foot..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Randy still refused to back down, and Marcus slapped him again, knocking out Randy's teeth and causing blood to flow continuously!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm giving you one more chance. Apologize!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus spoke coldly.</span></p></div>
