        <h1>Chapter 480 No Peeking</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Marcus removed Jade's pants, he noticed she was wearing purple lace underwear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The underwear was semi-transparent, revealing faint glimpses of what lay beneath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The dark patch peeked through the fabric's gaps, exuding an undeniable allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No peeking..." Jade murmured shyly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade hadn't expected herself to be in such a state; if she had known, she would have made sure to tidy up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now it was too late. Marcus had seen everything, leaving her flustered and embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How am I supposed to help you if I don't look?" Marcus replied with a playful smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade's face turned bright red, and for a moment, she was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet she couldn't shake the feeling that Marcus was taking advantage of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just... take it easy, okay? This is my first time being so exposed in front of a man, and it's a little embarrassing," Jade muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She closed her eyes decisively, refusing to look at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus chuckled and quickly gathered his Timeless Numinous Energy, channeling it into his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he gently placed his hand on Jade's flat abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mmm..." Jade let out a soft sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instantly, Jade felt a rush of warmth spreading through her lower abdomen, sending a strange, tingling sensation coursing through her entire body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a feeling she had never experienced before. For a moment, she nearly cried out but managed to hold it back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hang in there. The treatment process might be a little hard to bear," Marcus warned her gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus gave her a heads-up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade nodded lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had steeled herself to endure whatever came next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But when Marcus' Timeless Numinous Energy began coursing through her body, she truly understood the meaning of irresistible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under the surge of energy, Jade's body trembled violently, as though every nerve had been set ablaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A wave of intense pleasure rushed over her, crashing like a tide and enveloping her completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sensation was so overwhelming that soft moans escaped her lips despite herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her lower body tightened involuntarily, and she felt a sudden dampness within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade couldn't help but feel as if she was being violated by Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She instinctively opened her eyes, only to see Marcus' hand resting on her abdomen, without any inappropriate moves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Still, the feeling grew stronger, causing Jade's lips to quiver and her face to flush a deeper red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She felt an aching emptiness, an overwhelming need to be filled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The stimulation of her sensitive nerves made her lose herself entirely, her cries growing louder with every moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah... mmm... oh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, Jade lifted her delicate hand, instinctively running it over her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One hand pressed against her firm chest, kneading it firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other hand slipped instinctively down to her lower region.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment her fingers grazed the sensitive point within the folds, Jade lost control entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her body trembled violently, and her lower region contracted fiercely as a flood soaked through her purple lace underwear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her entire being was enveloped in that overwhelming sensation of bliss, making her forget everything else in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah... Marcus, aren't you treating me? Why does this feel so good? It's such a strange feeling, but... it feels amazing," Jade managed to say, her voice trembling with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, her mind was completely overtaken by an endless wave of desire. She couldn't stop twisting her hips in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was only then that she realized her hand had wandered to a place it shouldn't be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Embarrassed, she quickly pulled her hand away from the sensitive area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her fingertips were damp, carrying a faint, delicate scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The treatment stimulates your sensitive nerves, which naturally awakens your primal desires. My Timeless Numinous Energy has the ability to soothe and satisfy those desires, which is why you feel this way&mdash;it's completely normal," Marcus explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, one side of Jade's chest was exposed, and her lace underwear had been pushed aside, faintly revealing the soft skin beneath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sight, combined with her intoxicating expression, delivered a powerful visual impact to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Marcus felt heat rising within him, but he forcefully suppressed his reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing Marcus' explanation, Jade, as a doctor, could understand the situation but still felt deeply embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, when will the treatment be over?" she asked hesitantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On one hand, she didn't want Marcus to witness this shameless display any longer, but on the other hand, the overwhelming waves of pleasure made her reluctant to let it end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These conflicting thoughts left Jade trapped in an endless swirl of complex emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Almost there&mdash;just hang on a little longer," Marcus reassured her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus increased the output of his Timeless Numinous Energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This sent Jade to another peak, making her cry out loudly as her mind went completely blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, at a certain moment, under the intense stimulation of the Timeless Numinous Energy...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The cold energy within Jade's body was completely purged, and her entire circulatory system felt smooth and rejuvenated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The intense pain in her lower abdomen disappeared entirely.</span></p></div>
