  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's your name?" Marcus sized up the woman and asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman was a bit shy and deliberately wrapped the bath towel around herself more tightly before answering, "I'm Susan Thompson, the daughter of Elliott Thompson, the vice-chief of the tribe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded. He suddenly felt that the people of the Nuer Tribe were more innocent than he had imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Marcus was thinking, he saw Susan take out an exquisite dagger from the nearby table and walk towards him step by step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked in surprise, "What do you want to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan replied, "You've seen my naked body. According to the rules of our tribe, unless you marry me, I must gouge out your eyes. Otherwise, no man in the tribe will be willing to marry me in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gouging out someone's eyes was an extremely cruel thing, yet Susan said it so casually as if she was talking about something very ordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said helplessly, "Wait a minute."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan blinked and asked, "Are you willing to marry me? If you are, you must stay with me and guard this underwater world, and you're not allowed to set foot outside for the rest of your life. If not, our tribe will punish you, and you'll go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved his hand and quickly explained, "Ms. Thompson, I've explained to you before that my coming here was just a coincidence, not intentional. Are you really willing to gouge out my eyes?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you are, then come on!" With that, Marcus actually stood still, as if he was going </span><span>to let Susan do as she pleased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan slowly walked towards Marcus and raised the exquisite dagger high, aiming it at Marcus' eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at his handsome face, Susan suddenly stabbed the dagger towards Marcus' right eye!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the dagger stopped about 0.4 inches away from Marcus' face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan retracted the dagger, seemingly unable to bear to hurt Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't bring myself to do it..." She said, then looked seriously at Marcus and asked, "Are you willing to marry me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was stunned and didn't know how to answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had too many missions to complete, so naturally, he couldn't stay in this underwater world with Susan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan saw Marcus' dilemma and was just about to speak when there was a knock on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Thompson, are you in there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this voice, Susan immediately became flustered and said, "Yeah, what do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person outside the door said, "Ms. Thompson, Princess Nadia has fallen ill and is dying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan said hurriedly, "Well, I'll be there right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person outside the door said, "Okay, Ms. Thompson. I'll wait for you outside the door."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan said hurriedly, "No need. You go to Nadia first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person outside the door said, "Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Susan heave a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If others found out that Marcus was in her room and she was naked, her reputation would be damaged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that were the case, if Marcus refused to marry her as he did now, he might be given the extreme penalty by the tribe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone in the tribe is ill. I have to go and take a look," Susan said to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan said shyly, "I need to get dressed. Could you please turn around?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Marcus realize that although the room was large, it didn't have a bathroom or a cloakroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned around and said, "Is it okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, even if he turned around, with his spiritual powers at the Ancient Martial Stage Nine, it would still be very easy for him to see Susan's naked body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus turn around, Susan felt at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The white bath towel slipped off, revealing an exciting scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan had a perfect figure. Her breasts were round and full, showing no sign of sagging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her legs were beautiful, and her figure looked quite harmonious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just from the perspective of body proportion, Susan was like a goddess, captivating people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan had the most perfect body proportion among the women Marcus had ever seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at her body, Susan was very reluctant that Marcus had seen her naked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly came to her senses, found a dress in the cabinet, and put it on, then said to Marcus, "You can turn around now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus then turned around and was pleasantly surprised to see Susan dressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The long dress fully brought out Susan's beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had never thought that there could be a woman in this world who was both sexy, elegant, and holy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait for me in my room. I'll go and check on Nadia," Susan said to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regarding this unexpected guest, Susan didn't know how to deal with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Raphael and her father knew Marcus' specific background, they would surely lock him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan was kind and didn't want to see Marcus end up like other outsiders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Marcus had seen her naked, Susan still didn't want that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could you tell me what kind of illness Nadia has?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan said, "Nadia's illness is a strange disease that most people in the Nuer Tribe will get.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The people of the Nuer Tribe have been suffering from this illness since birth. I also have the same illness as Nadia, but it's not as serious as hers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan scanned Marcus and then asked, "Why are you asking? You're not planning to do anything bad to us, are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since coming here, Marcus had been inquiring about various information about the Nuer Tribe, which couldn't help but make Susan suspicious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You misunderstand. I asked about Nadia's illness because I want to help her," Marcus said lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Timeless Numinous Energy had strong healing power. When he was at the Ancient Martial Stage Two, he could already treat patients with advanced cancer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After his cultivation base broke through to the Ancient Martial Stage Nine, the healing effect of Timeless Numinous Energy became even more powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus wondered whether he could help the people of the Nuer Tribe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had accidentally barged into Susan's room and seen her naked, and he wanted to make up for it in this way.</span></p><div class="pagination">
