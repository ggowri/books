  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Noel spoke, his gaze fell upon Natalie with an air of arrogance. "Do you believe I can shut down all eight of your stores across </span><span>Uswad</span><span> with just one word?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, Hadley's face lit up with a triumphant grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Natalie, her voice dripping with disdain. "Natalie, don't think for a second that sleeping your way to some cash puts you on my level. Your little fortune is nothing to Noel. One word from him, and you'll have nothing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing their threats, Natalie felt flustered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shot a desperate glance at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley sneered, "What's the use of looking to him for help? He's just some hick from </span><span>Solomia</span><span>. What right does he have to stand toe-to-toe with Noel?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I advise you to accept your fate now, Natalie!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Noel confidently made a phone call, instructing someone with a smug tone to use family connections to boycott Natalie's jewelry stores.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By employing this tactic to choke off the customer base, Noel made sure no one dared to buy into her products. This strategy effectively stifled any hope of recovery, leaving her business in a dead end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Noel, you're incredible! Truly worthy of your family's influence. One call can strip this woman of everything!" Hadley praised</span><span> him</span><span>, giving him a thumbs up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noel's eyes roamed unabashedly over Hadley's ample chest. "Just make sure you're ready to breastfeed me tonight like last night. I didn't quite get enough," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley blushed, her expression turning seductive. "Don't worry. Tonight, I'll make sure you're fully satisfied."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Satisfied, Noel nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Marcus notice Hadley was tall and seemingly frail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she was endowed with so enormous breasts that even her loose clothing couldn't conceal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her chest was impressively voluminous, each breast rivaling the size of a soccer ball. It was little wonder that Noel found himself completely enthralled by her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Natalie, did you hear that? Your newly acquired stores are about to go under. If you regret it now, kneel, apologize, and lick my shoes clean. Maybe, considering our past friendship, I'll ask Noel to spare you. Otherwise, bankruptcy is your only future!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley turned her head, her expression brimming with pride as she addressed Natalie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she actually extended her right foot out with a deliberate motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to the less-than-ideal sanitary conditions of the night market's pathways, her foot was now covered in mud, appearing quite grimy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie felt a wave of nausea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Marcus finished his last skewer, stood up slowly, and fixed his gaze on Noel. "Does your family know you're out here throwing their name around?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noel's eyes turned icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell does that have to do with you? Stop spouting nonsense, or I won't be so polite!" he yelled at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley scoffed, "Who do you think you are, country boy? Playing the big shot in front of Noel? Do you really think you have any say in his family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ignore him, Hadley," Noel sneered with disdain. "He's just another nobody acting like he's somebody, typical of those who haven't had a taste of the real world's harshness yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfazed, Marcus turned to Hadley. "She wasn't wrong earlier," he said. "I can influence the Ortega family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Noel or Hadley could react, Marcus dialed Oliver's number, succinctly explaining the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver was furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He barely remembered Noel, a distant relative who, along with his parents, had been riding on the Ortega family's coattails.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the main family had turned a blind eye, using the family name to lord over others was crossing the line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver had reached his limit. And other direct descendants of the Ortega family were equally fed up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These distant relatives had been running wild, using the family name to throw their weight around without a shred of decency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their actions were dragging the Ortega family's name through the mud, staining its reputation in the eyes of the people of </span><span>Uswad</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, when Marcus explained the situation, Oliver made his decision. He would deal with Noel himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Marcus ended the call, Noel sneered and asked, "Who were you pretending to call? You think you can deal with me? I'm dying to see how!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Battle God Oliver," Marcus replied calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mention of Oliver stunned both Noel and Hadley before they burst into derisive laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're saying you just called Battle God Oliver?" Noel said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus confirmed nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noel burst into laughter again, his voice dripping with sarcasm. He laughed so hard that he could barely catch his breath, his shoulders shaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took him a moment to catch his breath. He turned to Marcus and muttered, "You're damn hilarious! Do you even know who Battle God Oliver is?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can just call him up? Have you lost your damn mind? </span><span>So</span><span> fucking interesting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley joined in, sneering, "Yeah, this guy's something else. His lies are getting wilder by the minute."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to Natalie, she mocked, "Natalie, I thought your boyfriend was just a broke nobody. Now, I see he's not only that but also delusional. How did you end up with such a fool?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie herself was shocked at Marcus' claim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a native of </span><span>Uswad</span><span>, there was hardly anyone who hadn't heard of Battle God Oliver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver was a legend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, Marcus had proven his impressive strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Natalie found herself hardly believe that Marcus befriended Oliver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver wasn't just incredibly powerful, a legend in the </span><span>Uswadian</span><span> military, but he was also a future heir of the prestigious Ortega family from Kingston!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such an elite figure was far beyond the reach of ordinary folks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley continued, "I'm not exaggerating here, but even someone like Noel from the Ortega family doesn't have the clout to just call up Battle God Oliver. So, how on earth would Marcus, an outsider, have that kind of access?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
