  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't care less about what the people at Divine Mount thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already brought Ada to the </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall region.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They landed on a massive ice floe floating on the ocean surface, spanning hundreds of yards in diameter like a mobile island drifting on the waves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before they loomed the colossal Ice Wall, hundreds of meters high, stretching endlessly to the horizon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It stood like an impenetrable barrier, completely isolating their world from whatever lay beyond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To ordinary people, the sky above the Ice Wall appeared normal. Still, Marcus could faintly detect an almost imperceptible constraining force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This force seemed beyond anything a regular warrior could control, belonging to an entirely different dimension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus attempted to probe the barrier with his spiritual senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mind exploded like a thunderclap when his spiritual powers touched the constraining force, nearly knocking him off his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart raced wildly, cold sweat breaking out on his forehead as he barely managed to stand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This constraining force is overwhelming! Far beyond what any warrior like us could handle. No wonder humans have lived on Earth for millions of years without many venturing beyond the </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus thought to himself, his eyes trying to peer beyond the barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ice Wall proved vastly more extensive than he had imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mortal eyes couldn't penetrate beyond the Ice Wall. The massive structure loomed before him like ancient armor, completely sealing off the outside world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Where sky met earth, everything faded into an endless white expanse with no visible end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How... how did we suddenly get here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada finally snapped out of her shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She vaguely remembered standing at the peak of Divine Mount just moments ago. They'd somehow traveled to the </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall region in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt surreal that she had to double-check to ensure that this wasn't just a dream, but everything around her seemed very real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I brought you here," Marcus replied coolly, his eyes still scanning the surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But... but how did you do it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada was too stunned to take in their surroundings, still trying to process what had just happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' abilities had shattered entirely her understanding of what was possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The distance between Divine Mount's peak and the </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall region was over </span><span>6200</span><span> miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even humanity's fastest technology, intercontinental cruise missiles, would take about fifteen minutes to cover that distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While some mighty warriors had mastered flight techniques, reaching this area would still take several hours or even days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had transported her to the </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall region in just one second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Ada, this was nothing short of a miracle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't ask questions you shouldn't ask. Understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his cultivation progressed, his teleport abilities grew exponentially more potent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could now move freely to any location on Earth he knew of and even transport another person along with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy cost had also decreased significantly compared to before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, using only thirty percent of his energy, he had successfully transported himself and Ada to the </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall region.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada's beautiful eyes sparkled, her heart trembling with amazement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She watched Marcus sit cross-legged on the floating ice, channeling the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire to restore his depleted Numinous Energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Ada's </span><span>first time</span><span> witnessing Marcus in cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cultivation manuals seemed quite different from that of ordinary warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Numinous Energy radiating from his body was utterly distinct from that of everyday warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was more refined and integrated better with his body, strengthening his bones and nourishing every organ and cell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada had experienced this miraculous Numinous Energy when Marcus removed her Blood Curse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Witnessing Marcus' cultivation firsthand, Ada was increasingly amazed by the miraculous power of the Timeless Numinous Energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just fifteen minutes, Marcus had fully restored the damaged Numinous Energy within his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he slowly concluded his practice and stood up, he had returned to his peak condition, his eyes radiating with a sharp gleam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Liam and others haven't arrived yet. What should we do now?" Ada asked Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' gaze fell upon the </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall, his pupils flashing with determination. "I want to scout the space-time gate area first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada responded, "I've heard the </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall's space-time gate is located in the deep sea near the ice-strengthened zone. It could be dangerous for you to go alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A look of resolve flashed across Marcus' eyes. "This is a risk I'll have to face sooner or later. Might as well be now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus' determination, Ada took a pearl from her Spatial Ring and handed it </span><span>to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pearl was about two inches in diameter, a deep sapphire blue that seemed to glow from within. It was utterly transparent and radiated blue light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the Aqua Sphere. It will protect you from the ocean's pressure and let you breathe underwater normally," Ada explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus pocketed the Aqua Sphere. "Thanks. Be careful while you're here. If you run into trouble, break this amulet, and I'll know you need me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He handed Ada a yellowed amulet, then walked to the edge of the ice floe and jumped straight in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When his body hit the water, he felt the bone-chilling cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the sensation lasted only a second before an invisible force pushed it away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus instinctively looked down to see the Aqua Sphere glowing in his pocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The light quickly enveloped his body, creating a barrier between him and the seawater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Ada had said, under the Aqua Sphere's influence, the water no longer affected his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only could he breathe normally, but he couldn't even feel the usual sensation of being submerged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Except for being able to swim freely through the water, it felt exactly like being on land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus thought, "This Aqua Sphere is truly remarkable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body gradually descended toward the deep ocean zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The waters teemed with various marine life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to the remoteness of the </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> region, many of these fish species were entirely new to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus dove deeper, numerous fish gathered around him, seemingly curious about their unexpected visitor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Marcus reached a depth of about one thousand meters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the limit of sunlight penetration, with nothing but pitch darkness below, like staring into an abyss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this thousand-meter depth, the water pressure increased dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without the Aqua Sphere's protection, no ordinary person could withstand such terrifying pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus continued his descent, he extended his spiritual powers, attempting to probe the deeper regions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, that area seemed sealed by some constraining force, completely blocking his investigation into his spiritual powers.</span></p><div class="pagination">
