        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep your voice down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man whispered a warning to the girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The way he looked at Marcus was like looking at prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How much commission can I get?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl asked expectantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man said, "That depends on how much wealth he has and how well he works at the mine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl said, "He looks quite tall and strong, so he should be able to work for a year or two. If he gets sick, we'll just kill him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two chatted in low voices.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Listening to the conversation between the two, Marcus sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized that this seemingly simple girl was actually a devil in disguise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They should be active in the trading market all year round, looking for prey that was both wealthy and capable of working.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They would lure their prey into the specific area, rob them, and then send them to the mines as slaves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before this, Marcus had only seen such things in movies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never thought he would one day actually encounter such a thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he did not expose them directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, Marcus wanted to take a look at their mineral veins and wait for an opportunity to act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hi, you want to buy energy crystals, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man in the red vest walked over and asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Energy crystals are not common, and they are definitely not traded in an ordinary market. I will take you to a place where I guarantee you can buy high-quality energy crystals. Get in the car!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, the man in the red vest took the initiative to open the car door for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't hesitate and sat on it directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides him, there were two other men in the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two men had sharp eyes and didn't say anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the car started and drove away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They passed through a series of alleys and were soon out of the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They first drove for more than two hours on the highway, and then it was all hilly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another hour passed. And they entered a lush tropical rainforest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This rainforest was sparsely populated, and the roads were becoming increasingly </span><span>difficult to navigate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if to divert Marcus' attention, the man in the red vest chatted with Marcus while driving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He acted very friendly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other two men never spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, at two o'clock in the afternoon, the car stopped in an open area in the middle of the rainforest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a lake here with a diameter of about eleven hundred yards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were many </span><span>Southvaia</span><span>-style wooden houses built around the lake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind the wooden houses was a vast rainforest, which was full of tropical trees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On one side of the rainforest, there was a muddy road, with trucks carrying ore coming in and out from time to time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We are here. Get off the car."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man in the red vest reminded Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can I buy energy crystals here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked casually, took out his cell phone and saw that there was no signal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, his memory was far beyond that of ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the car had traveled hundreds of miles, Marcus could still clearly recall the route.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He guessed that he should be on the border of the country.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The area was inconvenient to transport, covered by vast rainforests, and full of rampant criminals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All kinds of illegal trade thrived in this area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If someone got killed here, the cops couldn't find the killer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the place where Marcus was should be the mine office area mentioned by the man in the red vest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ore carried by the trucks was dug out from the veins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll know. Why are you talking so much?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bearded man who had been silent couldn't help but speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was hoarse and low, which made people feel creepy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, another man pushed Marcus under the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus still pretended to be innocent and said to the man in the red vest, "Take me to buy energy crystals now. I have something else to do and am anxious to go home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boy, you can't go home..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man in the red vest finally revealed his hideous face that had been hidden for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the two men behind him had taken out their pistols and pointed them at Marcus' temples, saying, "Take out all the valuables on you, or we'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus pretended to be terrified and asked, "Where am I? Why are you doing this to me?"</span></p></div>
