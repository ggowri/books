  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh, I wish I could find such a rich boyfriend!" Several women gathered together to talk, looking at Sheila with envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, Betsy said, "Actually, the most regrettable person in our class is Catherine. She is the most beautiful girl in our class, but her boyfriend is so ordinary."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betsy's words immediately resonated with the others present. "Yeah, I think so. When I was in school, all the boys in the class had a crush on Catherine. She is so beautiful now, and it's easy for her to have a rich man. It's really a pity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some men looked at Marcus with a hint of jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A man named Baily Fraser stood up. Half-jokingly, Baily said, "Catherine, I've had a crush on you since I was a kid. All our classmates know about it. Now, I'm a civil servant in Solomia. Why don't you break up with your boyfriend and stay with me? After all, I'm better than him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A man next to Baily joked, "When we were in school, Baily was the one who pursued Catherine the most. I still remember that he carved Catherine's name on his left wrist. Is it still on your wrist, Baily?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Baily showed his wrist. "Look, her name will be on my wrist for the rest of my life. It proves my feelings for her. Catherine, am I not better than your boyfriend? What kind of work does he do? Why did you choose him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What Baily said sounded like a joke, but it was impolite and provoking to say it in front of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catherine frowned, "Baily, stop joking. My boyfriend is capable. You can't compare to him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her words were blunt, and Baily's face immediately turned flushed in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Baily was a civil servant in the Solomia City Hall, and he was about to be promoted to vice section chief. As long as he got the commission, he could officially take office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Baily was only 23 years old, and he had already been promoted to vice section chief. He was quite outstanding among his peers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Catherine had just said that Baily was no match for Marcus. It immediately aroused Baily's aggression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Baily could speak, a girl who had a crush on him snorted, "Catherine, tell me your boyfriend's job. You said he was better than Baily. Show us the evidence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Upon hearing this, Baily looked at the girl and gave her a look of gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some men kept asking Catherine, wanting to know Marcus' occupation. There was contempt and ridicule in their words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In their view, Baily had already been promoted to vice section chief at the age of 23. He was better than most of his peers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus had not spoken since he entered the private, and he looked very arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had long disliked Marcus and wanted Baily to teach him a lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Catherine, just tell us. Sheila also wants to know it," Betsy sat next to Catherine and said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those people kept asking, and their words were full of contempt for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catherine couldn't help it anymore and said, "Have you heard of Golden Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A man said, "Golden Group? It's the best company in Solomia. We know it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A girl wearing glasses said, "I work in the accounting department of Golden Group. Catherine, is your boyfriend also an employee of Golden Group? Which department does he work in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catherine said, "My boyfriend, Marcus Fitzgerald, is the owner of Golden Group." She didn't like to show off, but these people forced her to tell the truth, so she had to say it to silence these snobbish classmates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, everyone fell silent with disbelief on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a while, a girl stood up and said, with a hint of sarcasm in her eyes, "What? Catherine's boyfriend is the owner of Golden Group? Do you believe it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing this, many people came to their senses and laughed mockingly, looking at Catherine as if she were a fool. "Catherine, we haven't seen each other for many years. I didn't expect that you would become a braggart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your boyfriend is the owner of Golden Group? Do you know how much the company's net assets are?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you want to brag, you should have solid evidence. You're bragging too much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, we are all old classmates. Can't you be honest? Even if your boyfriend is jobless, we won't laugh at you!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
