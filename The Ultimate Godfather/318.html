  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this true?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Robert once again confirmed. After all, it was far too shocking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Would I joke about my grandson's life?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon's expression darkened slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you can save my grandson's life, I promise to help your daughter advance to Halvard Medical School in Acoton!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Robert's eyes flickered. After thinking for a while, he said to Jordon, "Well, I can take you to Mr. Fitzgerald and show your request. As for whether Mr. Fitzgerald is willing to rescue him, I'm not sure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Jordon nodded immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his view, given his status, Marcus had no reason to refuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Robert paused what he was doing and went to find Marcus at his hotel with Jordon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since Marcus had told Robert the address before, Robert and Jordon soon came to the door of Marcus' room and rang the doorbell cautiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the moment, Marcus, who just finished counting the spoils, was surprised to see Jordon and Robert coming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I'm really sorry to bother you so late."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Robert apologized sincerely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it weren't for his desire to send Jade to study in Acoton, he wouldn't have interfered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What can I do for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had little fondness for this professor from Acoton.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My grandson's pancreatic cancer has spread, and I am here to ask you to help!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon came straight to the point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, even while pleading, he struggled to let go of his academic pride, his tone lacking the humility the situation called for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If he doesn't drink, he can last at least a month. But you didn't take my advice seriously," Marcus remarked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon frowned, faint regret flickering in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he refused to show it. His tone still carried the air of superiority as he said, "What's done is done. My grandson's condition is critical now. Please save him immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This sentence was even more commanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It made Robert's heart sink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the way here, he told Jordon many times to approach Marcus with humility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon, however, had a feeling of seniority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He still thought he was superior to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought he was a world-renowned professor and Marcus should treat his grandson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' brow furrowed instantly, "What does your grandson's illness have to do with me? Why should I treat him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon looked stunned and immediately said, "I am a professor at Halvard Medical School. If you can cure my grandson, you will have a bright future and even become famous for curing my grandson. I hope you can cherish this opportunity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon was getting more and more ridiculous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The more Jordon spoke, the more outrageous his claims became.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Robert broke into a cold sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew that Mike was beyond saving now unless the Cole family paid a price they couldn't imagine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sorry, I don't need this opportunity. Mr. Cooper, take him away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus smiled sarcastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't expect this old man to be so confused about the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon looked pale and asked quickly, "Then what do you want in exchange for saving my grandson?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus said, "It's very simple. Pay me, and I'll save him. That way, we'll owe each other nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon asked, "How much do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His confidence was restored the moment money was mentioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Cole family wasn't just known for academics.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their pharmaceutical empire dominated Acoton, and their wealth was vast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To him, money could solve anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't speak, stretched out a finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon asked, "Do you want 10 million dollars?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon frowned. "Is that 100 million?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus shook his head again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now visibly irritated, Jordon said, "You want 1 billion? That's outright extortion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing that Jordon was slow to guess, Marcus smiled, "You guessed it wrong. It's 100 billion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The words hit like a thunderclap. Jordon froze, speechless. Even Robert's jaw dropped in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One hundred billion dollars!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>According to the current exchange rate, it was equivalent to 700 billion Uswadian coins!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seven hundred billion Uswadian coins was an astronomical sum, even for the mighty Cole family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Robert never dreamed that Marcus wanted so much. It was daylight robbery!</span></p><div class="pagination">
