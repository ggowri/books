        <h1>Chapter 58 Another Form of Punishment</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes were focused on Jared and Haley, everyone wanting to see how they would resolve the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, kept his eyes closed, resting, with everything under his control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I remember correctly, there is another form of punishment at the auction," Jared said, his gaze becoming resolute as if he had made a significant decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hostess nodded in confirmation. Indeed, there was another form of punishment: leaving behind an arm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone willing to leave an arm on the spot could forgo the five-billion-dollar penalty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haley realized what his father was about to do and tried to stop him. "Dad, don't..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Jared ignored Haley's plea. He took a dagger from one of his men and fiercely chopped at his own left hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A squelching sound was heard, accompanied by Jared's scream as a bloody hand was severed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jared gritted his teeth in pain but bore it without another sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his father in such a miserable state, Haley was filled with self-reproach, and his hatred for Marcus reached a new peak!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his heart, his father was his hero.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, due to Marcus' malicious framing, his father had to chop off his hand in public. He must make Marcus pay a tenfold price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quick, pick up my dad's hand and rush to the hospital," Haley shouted at his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to quickly reattach the arm, minimizing the loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before the man could move, the hostess' voice came again. "The auction rules state that leaving an arm means just that, doesn't it, Mr. Haley Brown?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haley retorted with a flushed face and could only order his men to leave his father's hand behind, his gaze falling on Marcus as he gnashed his teeth and said, "Country bumpkin, you are so despicable, playing tricks on me. You wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus slowly opened his eyes and laughed, "Your father was the one who bid and couldn't pay. What does it have to do with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haley wanted to say more but was stopped by Jared. "Haley, don't argue with him. We'll accept defeat today, but we'll definitely get our revenge in the future!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Jared and Haley left the place with their people, looking rather battered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people's gazes fell on Marcus, only then realizing that the instigator of all this was the young man in front of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't help but admire Marcus' methods!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle blinked her big eyes, staring at Marcus as if trying to see through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you always looking at me?" Marcus felt a bit uncomfortable and couldn't help asking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald...you are so handsome..." Michelle blurted out, looking like a lovestruck fan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was helpless; he had never expected Michelle to act like a lovestruck fan before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to Jared and Haley's violation of the rules, the first round of bidding was invalidated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next round of bidding was held.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After learning about Marcus' financial resources and tactics, some people who had been prepared to bid again chose to wait and see, afraid of repeating Jared and Haley's fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, the difficulty of the auction was greatly reduced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Marcus only paid three billion dollars for the land, twenty billion less than he had expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the hostess on the stage couldn't help but give Marcus a thumbs-up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never seen this young man before, but he was so resourceful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that a bright new star was about to rise in Solomia's business world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, the payment and contract were completed in one go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this piece of land, Marcus should start building a pharmaceutical factory next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in the Alphard business car, Marcus didn't rush to start the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he sat in the rear business seat. He was tired and wanted to rest well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I'll drive." Michelle volunteered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No rush. Come here." Marcus waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle's pretty face turned red, and her mind involuntarily conjured up ambiguous images.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Mr. Fitzgerald deliberately sat in the back row. What does he want to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Michelle did not refuse and sat directly in another business seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught off guard, Marcus actually grabbed Michelle's tender hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald..." Michelle's heart raced, and her pretty face turned red instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus pulled Michelle's small hand and placed it on his chest. "It hurts here. Help me rub it."</span></p></div>
