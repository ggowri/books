  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus thought to himself as he quickly excavated the cores from the remaining sea monsters, storing them in his Spatial Ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the sea monsters were slain, a golden light suddenly burst forth from a tall altar at the center of the underwater city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The golden beam shot upward, piercing the ocean surface to connect with the sky above!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, the entire underwater world trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The light flickering between sea and sky was blindingly brilliant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had this not been in the remote </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall region, this miraculous sight would indeed have been documented by others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meditating on the ice floe, Ada was immediately drawn to the beam of light stretching into the heavens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprise flashed in her beautiful eyes as she wondered aloud, "Could the space-time gate be opening?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moment later, she dismissed the thought. According to the calculations of the Ancient Martial Arts world's experts, the space-time gate wasn't open for another three days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Throughout history, the space-time gate's opening had always been precisely predictable, never early or late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Ada was sure this light beam had nothing to do with the </span><span>gate's</span><span> opening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that guy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada couldn't help but picture the strikingly handsome young man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was also drawn to that beam of light deep in the ocean floor's crevice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes fixed on the center of the underwater city, flashing with shock as he swiftly approached that location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>About 10 minutes later, Marcus arrived at the base of the massive altar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the enormous beam of light shooting skyward from the altar, his heart filled with awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This beam contained powerful spatial forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It rapidly evolved into streams of Rune patterns, completely enveloping the surrounding space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If someone could look down from the void, they would see the underwater city covered by an enormous Formation Diagram.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within the Formation Diagram, patterns of various colors transform and shift, possessing a unique, extraordinarily ancient, and mysterious rhythm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This towering altar stood at the center of the massive Formation Diagram, the Rune Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waves of even stronger spatial forces poured out, enveloping Marcus' body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus suddenly felt his body being pulled by this spatial force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It drew him step by step up the altar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body bathed in the pillar of light atop the altar as various strange forces continuously seeped into his form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, his body completely vanished from the altar instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus felt his body enveloped by an intense spatial force as his vision blurred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When his sight returned, he found himself in a room that looked straight out of a medieval </span><span>Aulope</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spacious chamber was lavishly decorated, with wisps of steam dancing through the air. A soothing fragrance wafted into Marcus' nostrils.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following the scent's source, he saw an ornate bathtub nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A stunning blonde woman with emerald eyes was stepping out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her wet hair clung to her skin, highlighting her slender neck, curved figure, flat stomach, and intimate areas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surrounded by white mist, she looked like a goddess emerging from a flower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was shocked to find himself suddenly transported into a lady's private bath chamber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes met for a brief moment, both faces reflecting mutual surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman recovered first, moving to cover her ears and ready to scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus rushed forward and covered her mouth with his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Mmph</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terror filled her beautiful face as she tried to cry out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She struggled desperately against his grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was much stronger, and she couldn't escape his hold on her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at her exquisite features and stunning figure, Marcus swallowed hard and said, "Please don't panic. I mean no harm. I accidentally triggered a transportation rune in the underwater city and was suddenly teleported here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I sincerely apologize for this intrusion, my lady."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman's brow remained furrowed, clearly skeptical of Marcus' words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued to struggle vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus swiftly pressed several pressure points on her body, temporarily immobilizing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Releasing his grip, he said, "Look, I understand if you don't believe me. What I'm saying sounds crazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it's the truth. I promise you no harm, and I apologize for any offense. This wasn't my intention."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus' sincerity, the blonde-haired, blue-eyed woman began to calm down, her earlier panic and agitation subsiding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Relieved at her change in demeanor, Marcus grabbed a towel and carefully wrapped it around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can release the pressure points now," he said, "but you need to promise not to scream. Can you do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blonde woman blinked her bright blue eyes, perhaps reassured by Marcus' gesture with the towel, and gave a slight nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus cautiously began to release the pressure points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>True to her word, the woman didn't scream, though her gaze remained hostile. She demanded, "So you're saying you're from the outside world. Why have you come to the Nuer Tribe?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus answered honestly, "I'm here researching the space-time gate. I accidentally ended up in an underwater city and somehow got transported here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm curious. What is this place, and what is this Nuer Tribe you mentioned?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just another seeker after the space-time gate's secrets," the woman said wearily. "The chief tells us that outsiders are always trying to uncover the mysteries of the space-time gate. Over the years, many have come to the Nuer Tribe, disrupting our peaceful way of life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blonde, blue-eyed woman explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You mean others have come to the Nuer Tribe before me?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, they come every few decades. Most of them were consumed by greed. Bit off more than they could chew and met their doom," the blonde woman said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You still haven't answered my question! What is the Nuer Tribe?" Marcus asked eagerly, burning with curiosity about this strange place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Nuer Tribe is an ancient people who have lived in the deep waters of the </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall for generations. We live in isolation, avoiding contact with the outside world. Few know we exist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our sacred duty is to guard the </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall space-time gate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blonde woman replied calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never imagined that an ancient tribe had been guarding the </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall space-time gate all this time.</span></p><div class="pagination">
