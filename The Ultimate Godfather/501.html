        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you like it?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't like it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon deliberately shook her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then why did you just say you felt so comfortable and liked it so much? Which one is the truth?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon's fair face turned red again. "Mr. Fitzgerald, please stop! It's so embarrassing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, Mr. Fitzgerald, where exactly are we now?" Shannon asked curiously, glancing around at the strange surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Another world," Marcus said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, do you know magic? How did you bring me to another world?" Shannon asked, her voice filled with astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never imagined she would find herself in another world with a man doing such things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sort of," Marcus said, nodding lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon quickly put on her clothes, tidied her hair, and touched up her makeup, returning to her previous youthful and radiant appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, Marcus raised his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An invisible force erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, Shannon felt the space in front of her become hazy again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she found herself back on the familiar path near Solomia University.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, that's amazing! Mr. Fitzgerald, I want to learn magic too! Can you teach me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon looked at Marcus with pleading eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, no problem," Marcus replied calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he finished speaking, he pulled a magic tome from his Spatial Ring and handed it to Shannon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Practice according to the methods in this book. Once you master these magic skills, I'll teach you more powerful magic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave her a brief instruction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon took the magic tome with a bright smile. She had never dreamed she would one day be able to study magic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Marcus escorted Shannon to the dormitory building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze lingered on him, filled with affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deep connection they had just shared had made her fall completely in love with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reluctantly, she watched him walk away before finally heading back to the dorm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, it was already past 10 PM.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The streets were becoming quieter, with fewer people walking by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, in his Aston Martin, was on his way back to Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he parked the car, a cold light flickered out of the void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It shot toward him at high speed, aiming to strike!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the night, Marcus could clearly see the flying darts were the signature weapons of the Crankhurst Ninja.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These weapons were not only incredibly fast but also extremely stealthy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their power rivaled that of any bullet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Marcus had reached the Ancient Martial Stage Six in his cultivation, his physical body was still unable to withstand bullet impacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, when facing the ninja's attack, he could only dodge quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped forward, and his body instantly appeared outside the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While moving, he extended his spiritual sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He soon detected several figures chasing after him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These figures were dressed in black ninja uniforms, with ninja swords strapped to their backs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the dim light, they looked like black phantoms!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost simultaneously, a cold flash of light appeared not far away. It quickly formed into a Blade Ray, cutting towards Marcus in a deadly arc!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes sharpened. Instead of dodging, he pulled out his golden scimitar from his Spatial Ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, he released his own Blade Ray to meet the attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, a dull thud echoed through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood splattered from the void!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A ninja clad in black cried out as he fell from the air!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to kill me, why not show yourselves?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, holding the golden scimitar, stood proudly in the darkness, speaking loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, several figures descended from the void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them exuded a powerful aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader was a ninja at the peak of Stage Five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uswadian man," the ninja said with an air of arrogance, "I didn't expect you to have the guts to face us alone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to their earlier intelligence, Marcus' cultivation was roughly around Ancient Martial Stage Four, but it was absolutely impossible for him to exceed Ancient Martial Stage Five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the ninjas they had sent now were all at least Stage Four, comparable to Ancient Martial Stage Four experts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader himself had reached the peak of Stage Five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With such a lineup, taking down Marcus was more than enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt Marcus was essentially walking to his death by waiting for them here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you from the Crankhurst Black Dragon Society?" Marcus asked calmly, his expression unchanged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately thought of the Stage Three ninja he had killed, the one who was Easton's master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That man had claimed to be from the Black Dragon Society in Crankhurst.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're smart, but it won't help you. You offended the Black Dragon Society, and now you must die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The peak of Stage Five ninja sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he waved his hand, and the other ninjas quickly arranged themselves into formation, surrounding Marcus from all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their ninja blades gleamed with a chilling light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two of the ninjas took the lead, attacking with their blades. Their Blade Rays sliced through the air, leaving trails of cold light behind them!</span></p></div>
