  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gritting his teeth, Maximilian growled, "You dare to lay a hand on my wife? Do you even know what you're getting yourself into?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though he was already fed up with his wife's fiery temper, Fiona was still technically his wife.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fact that someone had the audacity to strike her in public was a blow to his ego.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maximilian was now completely resolved to make Marcus pay for this insult.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> you're Maximilian Lockwood, the executive vice president of </span><span>SiliconWave</span><span> Technologies?" Marcus asked, casually eyeing him up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus had only recently acquired </span><span>SiliconWave</span><span> Technologies and hadn't met the company's higher-ups yet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd heard of Maximilian, of course, but this wasn't what he had expected.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You know my name, huh? Then how about you get on your knees and apologize to my wife right now?" Maximilian sneered, his tone dripping with arrogance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To him, Marcus was just a bug&mdash;someone he could crush in a second if he wanted to.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kneeling and apologizing isn't enough. You need to make this bastard and that slut kneel and slap themselves until I'm satisfied!" Fiona snapped.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd gasped, shocked at how vicious Fiona's demand was.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fiona was known for being a 'tiger mom,' but this was something else&mdash;making someone kneel and slap themselves in public? That was over the top.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bystanders couldn't help but feel a mix of pity and dread for Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was it&mdash;Marcus had gotten involved with Fiona and Maximilian, and now he had to pay the price.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fiona's friends exchanged smug looks, eager to watch Marcus and Kiera get humiliated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In their eyes, Marcus and Kiera deserved whatever was coming to them for daring to defy Fiona.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maximilian nodded in agreement and turned to Marcus with an icy stare. "Did you hear that? My wife wants you two to kneel and slap yourselves until she's satisfied. I'll count to three, and if you don't follow through, don't say I didn't warn you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't flinch.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gave a small, derisive smile, then looked straight at Maximilian. "I don't get it. What makes you two think you can bully people like this, so boldly, without a care in the world?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maximilian's expression turned smug. "It's simple. I'm Maximilian Lockwood, the executive vice president of </span><span>SiliconWave</span><span> Technologies. What do you have? Nothing. No money, no power, no connections. You're a nobody, and you're about to learn your place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm not just a big deal here in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>. In Kingston, no one can touch me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He let out a laugh that was dripping with arrogance, as if he owned the world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A few people in the crowd winced, feeling that Maximilian had crossed a line.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Especially those who knew what had happened between Maximilian and Kiera earlier. They were disgusted, but no one dared speak up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>SiliconWave</span><span> Technologies was a massive player&mdash;worth hundreds of billions of dollars, even in Kingston.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Who would dare to challenge such a powerful man?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if Maximilian was being obnoxious, no one in the room had the guts to confront him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, the executive vice president of </span><span>SiliconWave</span><span> Technologies, huh? Is that your only title?" Marcus asked, unfazed by the stares.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maximilian's face twisted into a mocking grin. "Are you out of your mind? Is the executive vice president title not enough for you? You think I need more? I could squash you like a bug with just one phone call."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fiona, seemingly losing patience, snapped at Maximilian, "He's just stalling. Don't waste any more time. Deal with him now. Make him bleed a little, teach him a lesson so he'll never forget to stay out of my way."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maximilian nodded in agreement, ready to act.</span></p><div class="pagination">
