  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pull over," Marcus instructed the driver, his eyes narrowing at the scene unfolding before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it," the driver responded without hesitation, smoothly bringing the car to a stop by the curb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jade, listen to me. Mr. Nelson thinks highly of you. Why won't you just cooperate?" The bespectacled man spoke with frustration, his voice dripping with impatience. "You should seize this opportunity and get on his good side. It's just a drink&mdash;why are you acting like it's some kind of crime?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued, "If you make him happy, not only will our hospital secure priority access to the new batch of specialty drugs, but you'll also benefit from this personally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Nelson is the heir to </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span>. Sure, he's married&mdash;but so what? If he gives you a chance, you could rise far beyond being just the chief surgeon of </span><span>Solomia</span><span> Hospital."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man kept pushing, completely ignoring Jade's repeated refusals. His persistence made it clear that he was desperate to get her to comply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade's expression turned icy as she snapped, "I have no problem with socializing for business or negotiating a partnership between our hospital and </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span>. But that scumbag Aiden has already crossed the line, and you saw it yourself, Mr. Hughes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't understand why you're still insisting that I entertain him. I'm a doctor at </span><span>Solomia</span><span> Hospital, not some hostess. If Aiden wants someone to drink with, he can go to the red-light district. I'm not the right choice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she turned on her heel to leave, but the man grabbed her wrist once more, his voice turning harsh. "This party isn't just a casual get-together. It's crucial for securing our hospital's contract with </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span>. No one can afford to miss it, least of all you. You're coming with me. If you refuse, consider yourself fired&mdash;effective immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade yanked her arm free, her eyes burning with defiance. "Then fire me. To be honest, I've been wanting to quit for a while. Goodbye." She didn't hesitate for a second and turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's expression darkened instantly. His eyes flickered with something sinister as he barked to the men standing nearby, "Grab her! I don't care what it takes&mdash;drag her to Mr. Nelson! If we lose this deal, we're all screwed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men exchanged looks before stepping forward, their gazes turning cold and resolute. They were really about to take action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop." A chilling voice rang out from nearby, halting them in their tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Startled, they all turned toward the source of the voice&mdash;only to see Marcus striding toward them with an air of absolute authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's eyes narrowed as he studied the newcomer. He had never seen Marcus before, nor did he recognize his name. He was Ronald Hughes, </span><span>Solomia</span><span> Hospital's newly appointed vice president&mdash;renowned in </span><span>Acoton's</span><span> medical field for his expertise in surgery. His team, handpicked from </span><span>Acoton</span><span>, had only recently returned to </span><span>Uswad</span><span> to work alongside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Marcus' well-established reputation in the medical community, none of them had heard of him before. </span><span>So</span><span> when this unknown man suddenly appeared and placed himself between them and Jade, their expressions turned cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Jade's face lit up the moment she saw him. Surprise and joy flashed across her delicate features as she instinctively reached out and grabbed his hand. "Marcus! What are you doing here? When did you come to Kingston?" she asked, smiling brightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gently held her soft hand, his tone calm but firm. "I've been here for a few days. What about you? Why are you in Kingston?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade sighed, "The hospital sent me here with Mr. Hughes to negotiate a contract with </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span> for their latest patented drugs. Orders from above&mdash;I didn't have much choice."</span></p><div class="pagination">
