        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's here, the military's here! Now this is going to be interesting. I'm curious to see who wins and who loses in this battle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A voice rang out from the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people shared a similar thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all eager to see if this business legend could withstand the pressure in front of Finley's older brother, Preston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, a series of military vehicles pulled up by the roadside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doors quickly opened, and soldiers fully armed began to disembark from the vehicles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the lead vehicle, a gray-haired man stepped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was not tall, his appearance resembling Finley's in some ways, but his aura was incredibly strong, exuding an air of authority that made him seem formidable even without speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people around him immediately felt an invisible pressure, their hearts trembling involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being over sixty, Preston's posture remained straight, and his stride was filled with strength, making him appear as if he were walking with the wind at his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Preston, you've finally arrived."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the group arrive, Finley's face immediately lit up with a trace of surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing Finley and Aiden in such a sorry state, Preston's brow furrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Finley and asked, "What exactly happened here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a military officer with </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> armed forces, Preston remained relatively calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't blindly believe Finley's words but chose to analyze the situation from multiple angles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finley then recounted the events in detail, naturally embellishing parts of the story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Preston's expression darkened, and his gaze shifted to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Marcus had not been to the Special Advisor Department, Preston didn't recognize him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With an icy expression, he said, "My brother has no personal vendetta against you. Why did you have to go so far?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced Preston over without answering his question. Instead, he countered, "If I'm not mistaken, you're currently working in the Special Advisor Department. </span><span>Without permission from higher-ups, what right do you have to send so many soldiers to parade around the streets? What should the punishment be for that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was stunned by this response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't expected Marcus to stand his ground so boldly in front of a military officer like Preston, and his whole demeanor radiated power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words even carried a hint of scrutiny, much like how Finley had acted earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made everyone start to wonder if Marcus wasn't just a top-tier business tycoon with immense wealth, but also had military connections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to maintain such confidence when facing someone like Preston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Preston was taken aback as well. He hadn't expected this young man to know about his position in the Special Advisor Department.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the position had been confirmed, it hadn't been officially announced yet, and only a few people had heard the rumors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was puzzled as to how this unfamiliar young man knew about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Preston didn't seem to care too much. Instead, he adopted a superior stance and said, "You're right. I'm indeed working in the Special Advisor Department now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But whether I ordered the soldiers to come here is none of your business. You're interfering with a crucial decision made by a military leader. Just based on that, I could have you arrested!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Preston gestured toward the soldiers behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The soldiers immediately understood the command and raised their heavy weapons, ready to surround Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere became intensely oppressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade instinctively grabbed Marcus' hand, her face full of worry, fearing that the soldiers might attack him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you see that? If my brother wanted to kill you, it would be as easy as squashing an ant. Now, do you regret offending me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finley said smugly, his eyes full of mockery as he looked at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus stood there, calm, merely watching Preston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Preston, this guy dares to ignore your command. Just give the order to have him killed!" Finley continued, eager to see Marcus turned into a dead body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Finley's men were also armed, their security team from </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span> was no match for the regular army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finley was certain that once these soldiers fired, Marcus would be as good as dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Finley's words, Preston's expression hardened, and he gave his subordinates a decisive command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heavily-armed soldiers aimed their guns, ready to shoot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before they could act, a cold voice rang out from a distance. Everyone turned to see another military vehicle pulling up and stopping nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few people in military uniform stepped out of the vehicle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the front was a tall, alluring, and cold-looking female soldier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was strikingly beautiful, with an aura of authority that made her appear regal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she walked with confidence, she radiated an air of military grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This person was none other than Marcus' personal assistant, Lydia!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Gray, what are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Preston recognized Lydia immediately, his face filled with surprise as he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lydia frowned slightly and said, "If I hadn't come, you would have caused a huge mess!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Preston's expression stiffened, and he asked in confusion, "Ms. Gray, what do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lydia took a deep breath and said, "Do you even know who you're pointing your gun at?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Preston looked puzzled and asked, "Who?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is the Special Advisor appointed personally by Commander Ashford. Preston, you actually pointed your gun at his head. Do you think you've caused a huge mess now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, everyone present froze in disbelief, their eyes wide with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of them thought they had misheard or were imagining things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, they all knew Marcus as the legendary figure from </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> business world&mdash;Death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A top-tier tycoon with a net worth of trillions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That alone had been enough to shake them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no one could have imagined that after Lydia's arrival, another explosive identity of Marcus was revealed, which was Special Advisor!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some who were familiar with </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> military affairs recognized the title immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recently, Julian had appointed a Special Advisor, someone who had saved him from danger in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>, and as a result, was given this special position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Special Advisor enjoyed the same level of authority as the commander of a military region and could command thousands of soldiers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected this miraculous top figure to also be the legendary Death from </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> business world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To everyone, this revelation was utterly unbelievable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Jade, standing beside Marcus, was left in stunned silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze shifted to Marcus in sheer disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she first learned that Marcus was Death, it shocked her deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, to find out that he was also the Special Advisor everyone had been talking about in the military was beyond her comprehension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was explosive news, and it was almost too much to take in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Preston, Finley, Aiden, Ronald, and others were all rooted to the spot in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never could have imagined that Marcus held such a bombshell identity, especially Preston, whose heart couldn't stop shaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Lydia's words were true, it meant he had just pointed his gun at his superior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even as a military officer, fear began to grip his heart.</span></p></div>
