        <h1>Chapter 716 Be Your Woman</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edwin's words were instantly met with Payne's approval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Payne exclaimed excitedly, "Edwin's got a point. Didn't you brag that the Golden Group was yours? Then, you should take out more than 20 million dollars as a gift. Otherwise, your words will not be convincing at all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Atlas sneered, "Payne, you must be joking. He is just a poor driver, but you're demanding that he shell out over 20 million dollars as a gift. That's completely out of the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if we break every bone in his body and try to sell them for cash, they won't be worth 20 million dollars, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cora also laughed sarcastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had thought that she was here to arrange a blind date today, but to her astonishment, there was such a spectacle. It was really interesting!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Edwin, you are well aware that Marcus is just a driver, but you asked him to fork out such a large sum of money. Isn't this bullying?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He saved my life before, and he has already done us a favor. We shouldn't push things too far!" Mia reminded Edwin, unable to bear it anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He completely ignored her words and scoffed, "Mom, what does this have to do with me? He claimed that the Golden Group was his. If he's truly that wealthy, 20 million dollars is chump change for him. Just don't interfere with it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, I'm truly sorry. I invited you here today mainly to express my gratitude for you saving my mother. I never anticipated that things would turn out like this. You don't have to take them seriously. Just leave right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll never agree to be with Atlas. I will only be your woman in this life," Natalie whispered with an apologetic look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had originally meant to invite Marcus to have a peaceful meal at their home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The appearance of Cora and Atlas came as a complete surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus cast a reassuring glance at Natalie and said, "Don't worry. Just watch how I deal with them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, he had a highly unfavorable impression of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after having sex with her and realizing that she was a virgin, he regarded her as his woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In particular, learning about her family circumstances kindled his desire to protect her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, Marcus happened to see Cora introducing a man to Natalie. Naturally, he found it necessary to give these people a warning!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie felt a tinge of warmth. However, she was also aware that Marcus was ready to fight back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the last class reunion, he launched his counter-attack against Jenson after showing this expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie vividly remembered Jenson's pitiful state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she was looking forward to Marcus' next performance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you still standing there for? Can't you cough up the money? If that's the case, then scram with your measly million dollars! Don't hold up Natalie's blind date," Edwin mocked Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Payne said sarcastically, "That's right! If you don't have the money, why are you still dawdling here? You are not welcome in our family. </span><span>So</span><span> get out of here right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing that the time was nearly ripe, Marcus asked, "Is 20 million dollars a large sum?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, he pulled out his mobile phone and started operating it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's only a bluff. I am curious what this guy can do!" Atlas said with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within a minute, Marcus stowed his phone away once more and sat upright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is the money? Why don't we see it? Don't tell me you are playing tricks on us again?" Edwin asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I told you that this guy is just bluffing. Does he really think his outdated phone can somehow magically produce 20 million dollars?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Atlas saw that Marcus' lengthy operation yielded no results, his tone became even more sarcastic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Atlas pointed out, Marcus was still using an iPhone X that was seven years old. By now, it really did seem rather old-fashioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus didn't care about it. From his perspective, a mobile phone was merely a means of communication, and there was no necessity to chase after the so-called trends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as his phone worked, he would continue to use it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't believe you can scrape together more money, so you'd better leave now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you saved Mia's life, I don't want to kick you out. Otherwise, people will blame me for being ungrateful. I hope you can be sensible," Payne urged impatiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was unable to fathom why Marcus was so hypocritical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, he didn't have the means to produce more money, yet he persisted in acting as if he were wealthy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring their ridicule, Marcus said to Natalie, who was seething with anger, "Natalie, show the balance on your phone to them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was stunned for a moment before coming to her senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pulling out her mobile phone, she promptly opened the PayPal app.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sight of the current balance, Natalie froze in shock!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She even suspected that she had misread or was having a hallucination.</span><span> </span></p></div>
