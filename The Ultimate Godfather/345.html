        <h1>Chapter 344 Shut Up!</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victoria's expression faltered for a moment, but she quickly found a reasonable explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her husband was extremely invested in the interview process, and it was perfectly normal for him to come down for an inspection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, the interview process is nearly over. Just as you instructed, I've arranged for Gloria to take a department manager position. Are you satisfied with that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, Victoria immediately moved closer and asked Leif.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leif, however, remained visibly agitated. He didn't even spare Victoria a glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, his eyes scanned the room, searching for something&mdash;or someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, I'm right here. What are you looking for?" Victoria asked, her voice tinged with confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald. Where's Mr. Fitzgerald?" Leif barely acknowledged his wife's question, his attention fixated on the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been in a meeting when he received a call from Stephen Andrade, telling him to come downstairs and meet a person named Mr. Fitzgerald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the way Stephen spoke, this Mr. Fitzgerald seemed to be a very important figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leif didn't want to take any chances. He had left the meeting immediately and rushed downstairs to find him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with so many people around, he couldn't single out one person from the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald? Who's that? I thought you were here to inspect the interviews?" Victoria asked, a puzzled look on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leif replied with frustration, "I don't have time to inspect interviews right now. Mr. Fitzgerald is someone Mr. Andrade specifically asked me to meet. He's important."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, both Victoria and Gloria exchanged uneasy glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leif's behavior was definitely strange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, they didn't connect the dots and assume that Marcus was the person they were searching for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Marcus spoke up from nearby, drawing curious glances from everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it really be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was this guy the Mr. Fitzgerald Leif had been looking for?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't look like someone of importance. Why would Leif be looking for him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People began to dismiss the idea, unconsciously forgetting the phone call Marcus had made earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Country bumpkin, what nonsense are you spouting? Who do you think you are, pretending to be Mr. Fitzgerald? You're out of your mind. Someone should send you to the psychiatric hospital before you cause any more trouble!" Gloria's cold voice rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victoria also laughed mockingly. "Honey, this guy was the one who questioned my work earlier, trying to block Gloria's chance to get hired. He even claimed that you were supposed to come down to meet him. After the interviews are over, you should definitely deal with him. Take him to the mental hospital while you're at it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sound of Victoria and Gloria's voices, Leif's eyes finally locked onto Marcus in the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr... Fitzgerald..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leif's expression shifted, a flicker of recognition crossing his face. He hadn't expected the Mr. Fitzgerald that Stephen had emphasized so much to be standing right here, in line for an interview.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's him, honey. You'd better deal with him properly. We can't let people like him disrupt society any longer!" Victoria continued, a smug look spreading across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish, Leif snapped at her, his voice sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victoria and Gloria both froze in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was going on with him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for their reaction, Leif quickly strode toward Marcus. In front of everyone, he bowed deeply and said, "I apologize, Mr. Fitzgerald. I did not come out to greet you as I should have. Please forgive me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd fell dead silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victoria and Gloria were left utterly speechless. They had never imagined in a million years that Marcus was the very Mr. Fitzgerald Leif had been searching for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leif was the General Manager of the branch, essentially the top figure for Sync Group in Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, this influential figure had come down in person to greet Marcus, bowing with such deference. The scene felt surreal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leif, are you sure you're not mistaken? This country bumpkin is a friend of my high school classmate, Catherine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Her family is poor&mdash;how could her friend be someone of high status?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got to be confused!" Gloria spoke up quickly, unwilling to believe that Marcus was the person Leif should be showing respect to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I already told Victoria to shut up. Didn't you hear me?" Leif turned his fury on Gloria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gloria was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leif, who had always been kind and friendly with her, was now yelling at her like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It completely shattered her perception.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus turned his gaze toward Leif, his voice calm and indifferent. "Is that your wife?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leif's eyes narrowed, but he nodded. "Yes, Mr. Fitzgerald. What can I do for you?"</span></p></div>
