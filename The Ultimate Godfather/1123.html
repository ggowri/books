        <h1>Chapter 995 Breakthrough-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps due to Marcus's cultivation improvement, his sexual prowess seemed to have increased again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This session lasted nearly two hours.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Marcus a violent thrusting, his passion also reached the peak of the state, the semen all into Gertie's body, and her body fluids thoroughly integrated together.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under Marcus's fierce assault, Gertie reached her seventh orgasm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, overwhelmed by the intense pleasure, Gertie fainted directly, collapsing onto the bed with her body trembling uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The damp bedsheet revealed the frenzy of their earlier actions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus took a deep breath and wiped the sweat from his forehead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It had been a while since he and Gertie last made love.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And as she completely relaxed, his pleasure multiplied.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under the effect of Dual Cultivation power, Marcus felt his Cultivation of Acquired State Seven completely stabilized, even showing faint signs of a breakthrough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a long while, Gertie finally came to her senses from the pleasure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her face was still flushed, and she looked at Marcus with a seductive gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Did it feel good?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop talking..." Gertie's gaze shifted evasively, and she became shy again after regaining her composure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus felt a bit helpless. She had been saying it felt good earlier and even asked him to go faster, but now she denied it after it was over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Are all women like this?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm a bit cold, hold me," Gertie said, spreading her arms and showing her breasts to Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus naturally wouldn't refuse and pulled her into his arms.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling the softness of her body, he also felt incredibly fulfilled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My injuries are completely healed. It's amazing. You didn't even finish the healing just now, so why is this happening?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie asked. She had just used Inner Vision and discovered that her injuries had completely healed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had been seriously injured during her fight with those Ophidians.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just now, their healing was only halfway done, yet her injuries fully recovered, which truly shocked Gertie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Completed. Of course, it&rsquo;s completed. The healing process we just went through was many times more effective than normal healing, and you also received my semen. It&rsquo;s perfectly normal," Marcus said with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie understood what Marcus meant, glared at him, and said, "You're just lying to me. I don't believe that can heal wounds."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus glanced over Gertie and said, "This is the truth. You can check your own body. Your cultivation has now reached the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Nine, just one step away from advancing to the Return Essence stage!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Gertie began to check her state, half doubting.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm really about to advance to the Return Essence stage... This is simply unbelievable. I've worked so hard for so long and never had such an opportunity... Could it really be the effect of making love?" Gertie said, trembling, in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus smiled and said, "This isn't the first time you've benefited by following me. No need to doubt."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie believed the facts were indeed as Marcus said. Last time she engaged in Dual Cultivation with Marcus, she directly broke through years of bottleneck and achieved a breakthrough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seems that making love with Marcus truly brings endless benefits, and she also enjoys it greatly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Gertie couldn't help but feel shy again and vaguely felt that meeting Marcus might be a very fortunate thing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought she shouldn't have such thoughts, but that's the truth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since she met Marcus, not only did she see through that trash's true nature, but she also continuously advanced in cultivation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Gertie is about to reach the Return Essence stage in an extremely short time.</span></p></div>
