  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus came to the Aston Martin dealership and chose a new model, the Aston Martin DBS.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had a long history and outstanding performance in the entire Aston Martin series.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus particularly liked its low-key, elegant tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike Lamborghini, Ferrari, and McLaren, Aston Martin was not familiar to most people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was very suitable for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paid the bill and left. Including the optional accessories, the total cost was more than six million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just a drop in the bucket for him now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus got into the latest Aston Martin DBS and stepped on the accelerator as the 4.0T V8 engine made a charming roar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tens of thousands of accessories worked together to serve him alone, and the car shot out like an arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to his Ferrari, the interior of the Aston Martin was more luxurious and much quieter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It gave a feeling of elegance and calmness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus drove on the streets of Solomia on a rainy night and attracted many people's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was already six o'clock in the evening after he bought the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine told Marcus her home address on WhatsApp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled up to her house in his Aston Martin.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was an old house built in the 1990s and allocated to Laura by the government.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until now, their family of three still lived here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Laura had already completed divorce proceedings with Philip Wilson, Catherine's father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he refused to leave, continued to drink and gamble, and squandered all the family's property, leaving only this old house that was barely habitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus arrived at the courtyard and immediately found it old-fashioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was overgrown with weeds, and the ground was muddy because it was raining.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The walls in the corridor were peeling and leaking, and rats even occasionally came into view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus bought some fruit and supplements at the convenience store downstairs and then knocked on the door of Catherine's house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She opened the door in her apron and smiled sweetly, "Mr. Fitzgerald, come in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus put the gifts on the floor and noticed that Thomas was there, too, watching TV on the sofa in the living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, Dr. Fitzgerald, you are here, too," Thomas immediately sneered sarcastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus wasn't surprised that Catherine invited Thomas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, when Laura was hospitalized, Thomas helped Catherine a lot. He even drove them home personally, so it was natural that he was invited to the meal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dr. Fitzgerald, have you brought the car?" Thomas asked tentatively with a malicious smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas continued, "Aston Martin?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus made no reply and just threw the car key in front of Thomas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas was stunned. The sight of the two wings on the car keys instantly embarrassed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was truly the Aston Martin logo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that he really bought an Aston Martin?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was absolutely impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car key must be fake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was very likely that he got a fake product on Amazon just to show off!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas was lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, there were already various dishes on the dining table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine spent an afternoon in the kitchen and finally made a hearty meal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, Thomas, let's have dinner," Laura said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus put away the car key and sat down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas was upset. While thinking about how to make a fool of Marcus later, he sat down, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, Thomas, help yourselves and take it easy. Don't be polite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Catherine has been preparing the dishes in the kitchen all afternoon to thank you," Laura smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Marcus and said, "Marcus, without you, I would have died a long time ago."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus grinned and waved his hand, saying, "You're welcome, Laura. Catherine and I are friends. It's just a small favor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Catherine had finished her work and sat down to eat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas complained, "Laura, Marcus' medical skills are really excellent, and he can even cure cancer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, he is a bit of a boaster. But no one is perfect. It's normal that everyone has some shortcomings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing what Thomas said, Catherine knew that he was trying to stir up trouble again. Just as she was about to speak, Laura asked curiously, "Why is Marcus a boaster? I think he is pretty good, low-key, and honest. If Catherine can have a boyfriend like him, I will definitely be very satisfied."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura's praise for Marcus made Thomas' heart sink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he suppressed his anger and explained, "Laura, you forgot what happened during the day. Marcus' car broke down. It was a Volkswagen Bora worth 100 thousand dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But he kept saying that he would buy a luxury car worth millions of dollars. Just now, he used a fake car key to fool me. How hypocritical!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
