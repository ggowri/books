  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle quickly turned into a one-sided massacre.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a single ferocious punch, Marcus crushed the chest of the opponent, killing him instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the figure fell, its body became translucent before transforming into countless specks of starlight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The starlight then merged with Marcus' body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Marcus felt his entire being surge with vitality, and his combat strength increased noticeably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This discovery made his eyes light up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly realized that by passing each challenge, he could absorb his opponent's strength to replenish himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, his power was stronger than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Marcus defeated his replica, the second floor of the castle lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This signified that Marcus had successfully cleared the first challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the castle, Raphael and Ada, who had been guarding the area, finally relaxed a little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew the second challenge would be far more difficult. Marcus would face even greater trials.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' vision blurred for a moment. When it cleared, he found himself in another world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This place had mountains, rivers, and a sky filled with sun, moon, and stars. Mist swirled around him, giving the scenery an almost otherworldly feel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could react, two figures identical to him appeared in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So there really are two of me. Just as I thought," Marcus murmured to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sighed as he watched the two versions of himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To earn the right to pass through the space-time tunnel, he needed to clear all six levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If his guess were correct, the sixth level would pit him against six copies of himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This thought brought a hint of pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But since he was already here, retreat wasn't an option. He knew he had to carve his way through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to his experience from the first level, where he identified his weaknesses and absorbed his replica's strength, Marcus was able to hold his ground against the two replicas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as time dragged on, Marcus grew tired again and had to rely on pills to sustain himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Timeless Warrior's Grimoire provided him with powerful recovery effects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the battle continued, Marcus gradually adapted to the rhythm of fighting two opponents. In the process, he tapped into deeper reserves of his potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He noticed that while the strength of his replicas had doubled, they were merely illusions and lacked strategy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of their attacks was independent. There was no coordination between them, and sometimes they even accidentally interfered with each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although this happened rarely, it still disrupted their efficiency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the battle progressed, Marcus' skills improved steadily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His speed, agility, reflexes, defense, and offense all became sharper under the extreme pressure of the fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This improvement was tangible. He could feel his potential being constantly unlocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, Marcus spotted a weakness in one of his opponents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seizing the perfect moment, he delivered a precise punch to its critical point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The replica's head exploded on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The figure dissolved into starlight, which merged into Marcus' body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, his strength surged again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Additionally, the Numinous Energy he had spent in the earlier part of the battle was fully replenished as the starlight merged with his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was his depleted energy replenished, but his overall combat power grew stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This allowed him to deal with the remaining opponent with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within five minutes, he killed the second replica as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He once again gained power from that other person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After absorbing the second replica's strength, Marcus estimated that with the battle experience he had accumulated, he was now at least twice as strong as when he first entered the castle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This realization brought him great satisfaction and motivation to continue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The third, fourth, and fifth levels became increasingly difficult, but Marcus remained calm and composed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his growing combat experience and ability to absorb strength from his defeated opponents, he cleared each level one by one. Finally, he reached the sixth level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By this point, Marcus estimated that his combat power was at least three times greater than when he had first entered the castle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he faced his first-level self now, he was confident he could defeat it in two minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, it had taken him over an hour and a half to win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's finally reached the sixth level..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the castle, Ada's beautiful eyes glimmered with excitement as she watched the light of the sixth level glow. She couldn't help but feel admiration for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she couldn't see the details of his battles, she could imagine how difficult the challenges must have been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raphael, too, felt his heart surge with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had heard about the challenges of the space-time tunnel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three thousand years ago, a chief from their tribe, hailed as the most talented and powerful warrior in Nuer Tribe history, had attempted these trials after breaking through to Stage Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even to this day, his statue was worshipped in the Nuer Tribe temple, revered by future generations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, according to ancient texts from the tribe, this legendary chief had only managed to challenge up to the third level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus had reached the sixth level in just half a day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raphael realized that Marcus' strength far exceeded his expectations. His hands trembled as he processed the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the sixth level, Marcus faced six replicas of himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The difficulty was beyond description.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus showed no signs of fear. His sharp, deep-set eyes burned with an intense desire to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though six replicas of himself would be a terrifying challenge, Marcus' strength had grown immensely from the previous levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he had also gained rich combat experience. Faced with six of himself attacking simultaneously, he remained unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly took down one of them, absorbing his power and making himself even stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, he had figured out the key to clearing these challenges.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He only needed to kill one opponent as quickly as possible and absorb its strength. This would drastically reduce the difficulty of the fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This insight was crucial to his success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this understanding, Marcus handled the sixth level with increasing ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the battle began, Marcus launched a fierce attack, targeting the nearest replica. In just moments, he killed the first opponent. As the starlight merged with him, Marcus' power increased again. With only five replicas left, the pressure on him lightened significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus now had the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his more ferocious attacks, he quickly killed the second one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Absorbing the second man's power, Marcus felt his strength surge once more!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With only four men left, they no longer posed a significant threat to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than ten minutes, Marcus had cleared the sixth level and absorbed their power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well done, human. You have successfully cleared all six levels," that mysterious voice announced. "Now, you face two choices. First, you may claim your reward&mdash;passage through the space-time tunnel and three Return Essence Crystals, then leave the castle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Second, you may proceed to the remaining three levels for even greater rewards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Choose wisely."</span></p><div class="pagination">
