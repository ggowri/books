  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the domestic pharmaceutical environment was still largely in the stage of imitation, copying the formulas of big foreign pharmaceutical brands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only a few had their own patents, mostly in traditional medicine, while the medicine remained firmly under the monopoly of other countries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles' first patented formula was a medication designed for post-surgical recovery from major internal diseases.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It hadn't been released to the market yet, but it had already undergone numerous clinical trials with outstanding results, even surpassing several international giants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Marcus had high hopes for Charles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he turned the car around and drove straight to Charles' villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than half an hour, he had knocked on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Emily who answered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus, Emily was exceptionally warm, immediately calling out to Charles and Yvonne in the room. "Charles, Yvonne, Marcus is here! Hurry up and come out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the last matchmaking dinner where she'd witnessed Marcus' financial strength, Emily had been thoroughly impressed with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne bringing Marcus home hadn't escaped Emily's notice either. She'd seen the signs of their growing affection but had turned a blind eye, even going so far as to leave the house to give them some space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was worth noting that, in the past, Emily had been quite strict about Yvonne's upbringing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never allowed her daughter to associate with any unsavory men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her unusual behavior now had even Yvonne surprised. She felt her mother had somehow become a completely different person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Charles and Yvonne came out together to greet Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne was wearing a light pink loungewear set, her sleek brown hair tied into a ponytail, giving her a clean and fresh look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her long neck was graceful, and paired with her exquisite, delicate features, she radiated a refreshing beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been nearly a week since Yvonne last saw Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, seeing him again, her bright eyes seemed to sparkle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, come in!" she called out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles led Marcus into the living room, pouring him a cup of coffee, his hospitality evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is a recent breakthrough from our research lab. If we can mass-produce it, not only would the profits be substantial, but it would also capture a significant market share. Do you think it's feasible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles handed Marcus a report.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After carefully reviewing it for a while, Marcus smiled, "Mr. Miller, your work is one hundred percent reliable. Once the pharmaceutical company is set up, Yvonne can manage it. You and your daughter can handle everything from there, no need for me to interfere."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles and Yvonne exchanged a look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were deeply touched by Marcus' trust in them. In their hearts, they silently vowed to make sure the pharmaceutical company thrived once it launched. They wanted to repay Marcus for his faith in them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They chatted casually for a while longer. Charles received a phone call. After talking a few words, he quickly put on his coat and said to Yvonne, "I have surgery to attend to, so I'll have to excuse myself. Yvonne, you and Marcus have fun."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed Emily had overheard Charles' words from the kitchen. She hurried out, removing her apron. "I </span><span>just remembered,</span><span> my neighbor asked me to join her for a walk. I'll head out now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two don't rush off. I won't be back until after ten tonight. You can chat a bit longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Emily also left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her mother's reaction, Yvonne rolled her eyes. She knew what Emily meant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Charles and Emily were gone, the atmosphere in the room grew a bit awkward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been so long since they'd seen each other, and Yvonne didn't know how to face Marcus. She lowered her head, unwilling to look at him, didn't know what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But within less than a minute, a large hand wrapped around her waist, pulling her in a warm embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne let out a soft murmur and instinctively tried to pull away, but Marcus' strength was too much, and she found herself trapped in his embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his broad chest against hers, Yvonne felt her heart raced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss me?" Marcus asked in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne's body was soft, and a faint, pleasant fragrance seemed to drift from her, intoxicating and subtle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, why would I miss you?" Yvonne instinctively replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No? Then why have you been staring at me when you thought I wasn't looking?" Marcus smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His arm tightened, pressing her chest into him, the soft curves of her figure becoming even more pronounced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wasn't staring at you! You're just imagining things..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne continued to protest, her face flushed red, her heart pounding even harder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then why is your heart beating so fast? Are you sick? Let me check!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smirked, and in one swift motion, his large hand slid to the side of Yvonne's chest.</span></p><div class="pagination">
