  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua couldn't wrap his head around it. Back in school, he had liked Josie and pursued her for years. Even after Josie's husband passed away, he didn't mind that she had been married and had a child. He still confessed his feelings for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she rejected him again, saying she could never accept another man after her husband. At the time, Joshua had admired her, believing she was the epitome of loyalty and devotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "How many women can refuse to move on for the sake of a deceased husband? And yet, here she is, bringing along some young pretty boy and flaunting their affection in front of me, Hannah, and Molly. I suddenly feel like I'd been played."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group made their way to the room for the reunion. By the time they arrived, most of their former classmates were already seated around a massive round table, chatting and laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Josie, Hannah, Molly, and Joshua entered, the room fell silent. Everyone turned to greet them and help them find seats. But soon, people started noticing Marcus. He looked young, and Josie's intimate behavior with him piqued everyone's curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Josie, who's this handsome young man? Aren't you going to introduce him to us?" one classmate asked with a teasing smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, Josie, we've never heard anything about you having such a good-looking guy around," another woman chimed in, eyeing Marcus up and down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others joined in, eager to know more. After all, everyone had heard about Josie's late husband. She had always presented herself as a strong, independent woman&mdash;and a devoted one at that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, word had spread that after her husband passed, Joshua had expressed his willingness to be with her, only to be turned down. Yet here she was today, bringing along a man who was clearly much younger than her&mdash;and acting all lovey-dovey with him. It was a shock, to say the least.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie, sensing the growing whispers and questioning looks, set down her drink, stood up gracefully, and smiled. "Let me introduce you all," she said. "This is my boyfriend, Marcus. He's from Solomia and is 23 years old."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She left it at that, offering no further details about Marcus' background. Josie had always been a private person, and explaining too much would make it seem like she was trying to prove something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words left the room in stunned silence. People exchanged glances, their expressions filled with disbelief. Some began murmuring among themselves, struggling to understand what was going on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie wasn't just any woman&mdash;she was a well-known entrepreneur in Kingston, the founder of BioFusion Pharmaceuticals, worth billions of dollars. Sure, money wasn't an issue for her. But given her status, everyone expected her to find someone equally accomplished, someone on her level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "And Marcus? Well, besides being young and good-looking, what else does he have to offer?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A particularly nosy woman leaned in with a smirk. "Ms. Shelman, you still haven't told us what your boyfriend does. We've all known each other for years&mdash;why not give us a little more detail?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Josie could respond, another woman cut in with a chuckle, "If he really had some impressive background, Josie would've mentioned it already, don't you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laughter rippled through the group as others nodded in agreement. "Exactly. If I had a boyfriend with an incredible career, I wouldn't wait for someone to ask&mdash;I'd brag about him right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone echoed, "Yeah, come on, Josie, let's be real. You're clearly with him for his looks. What else could it be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone followed. "I mean, Joshua chased Josie for years, and now he's built a successful career. But Josie still rejected him and picked this kid instead? It's obviously about appearances."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah sighed and turned to Josie with a concerned look, "Josie, you see, everyone here thinks the same as Molly and me. We're all in our thirties now&mdash;we can't be making choices like teenage girls. You have a child to think about. You should find someone reliable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She leaned in slightly, lowering her voice. "Even though you run BioFusion Pharmaceuticals, even major companies like McHale Pharmaceuticals Group are struggling. Who knows what the future holds? If you had a strong, capable partner, you'd have nothing to worry about, don't you agree?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Molly seized the moment. "Honestly, Josie, I didn't want to say anything at first, but I feel the same way. In school, the three of us were the closest. We had the same goals and ambitions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hannah's husband, Adrian, is the Executive Vice President of McHale Pharmaceuticals Group. My husband, Jace, is one of the top raw material suppliers for Sync Group and Eastcomm Group&mdash;he's even on Kingston's top 20 rich list."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not saying this to show off," Molly continued, giving Josie a pointed look. "I just want you to see the bigger picture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We women can't spend our whole lives chasing love stories. Men with maturity and experience are far more dependable. Your boyfriend is only 23&mdash;he's barely out of college. How can he take care of you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sighed, "Hannah and I have always thought Joshua was a great match for you. He's made a name for himself in the pharmaceutical industry&mdash;his company is almost as big as BioFusion now. You know he adores you. He'd treat you well for the rest of your life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah and Molly made no effort to hide their disregard for Marcus. But Marcus wasn't offended. He could tell they genuinely cared about Josie, even if they were being rude about it. Besides, he had no intention of dealing with these women much in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their comments, however, gained support from the rest of the group. At this age, most of them had become realists. Gone were the youthful ideals of reckless passion. Now, it was all about security and stability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Josie was growing increasingly irritated by their blatant dismissal of Marcus. She straightened up and said firmly, "Hannah, Molly. I already told you earlier&mdash;Marcus is more than just young and handsome. He has a successful career of his own, one that even surpasses mine. So don't underestimate him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words only made her classmates even more curious. They thought, "A 23-year-old with a career bigger than Josie's? That means he is worth billions of dollars already. A man of that caliber would be famous across the entire business world. But no one has ever heard of a wealthy young businessman named Marcus, which means Josie is lying."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah and Molly, meanwhile, shared a knowing look. They understood Josie well enough&mdash;when she set her mind on something, she wouldn't back down easily. A few words wouldn't change her mind. It seemed they would have to take a different approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah spoke up first, "Josie, since you say Marcus has his own thriving business, why don't you tell us about it? We'd love to hear more."</span></p><div class="pagination">
