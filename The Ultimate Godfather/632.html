  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of everyone's watchful eyes, Cecilia approached Marcus and expressed her gratitude. "Mr. Fitzgerald, thank you for saving me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved off her thanks. "You're welcome. I just happened to be passing by."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glancing at Luna and Albert, Cecilia asked Marcus, "Mr. Fitzgerald, these two have offended you. How would you like to deal with them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without even looking at Luna and Albert, Marcus replied, "I'm not interested in dealing with such insignificant people. Just make sure they don't bother me again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecilia sternly told Luna and Albert, "You should be grateful to Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna and Albert's faces turned livid with reluctance, but they dared not defy Cecilia's command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They bowed to Marcus and said respectfully, "Thank you for your magnanimity, Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring them, Marcus walked over to Jade. "Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade nodded gently to Marcus and headed towards the exit of the private room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, wait a minute," Cecilia called out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What else?" Marcus turned to ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecilia smiled, and her face was full of anticipation. "I don't know your first name yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus," he casually replied, taking Jade's hand and leaving the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching their backs, many people were still in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was supposed to be a simple birthday party had turned into such a spectacle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert's initially arrogant demeanor was still fresh in everyone's minds, as he had been smug about Luna's favor and the Angel's Kiss he bought as a birthday gift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, within an hour, so much had changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Angel's Kiss was fake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert had tried to use his relationship with Luna to pressure Marcus, only to discover that Marcus was Cecilia's savior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, he had brought trouble upon himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more arrogant Albert had been, the more miserable he was now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His image in everyone's eyes had completely collapsed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Consequently, after Marcus and Jade left, the others dispersed as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost no one said goodbye to Albert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a hypocritical person was not worth their time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting in Marcus' Aston Martin, Jade said to Marcus, "Thank you, Marcus!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow. "For what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade replied, "First, for giving me Tears of the Angel as a birthday gift. Second, for helping me out of a tight spot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled. "I'm your boyfriend. Isn't it natural for me to do things for you? You don't need to thank me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, Jade leaned in quickly and planted a kiss on Marcus' cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling her soft lips, Marcus teased, "Are you really trying to seduce me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade's face turned red, and she glared at Marcus. "This is a restaurant parking lot. I don't believe you would dare do anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus kissed Jade's lips, and his tongue slipped past her teeth to savor her fully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade's eyes widened in surprise. She didn't expect Marcus to kiss her here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pounded his chest with her fists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, don't do this... Someone might see. Let me go..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Marcus' teasing, Jade found herself panting, and her voice trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave her a squeeze on the backside before pulling away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're so naughty. I'm not talking to you anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade continued to pant, and her cheeks were flushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus grinned. "Didn't you used to love it when I kissed you? What's changed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It depends on the situation. I'm nervous here, afraid someone will see," Jade said, lowering her head shyly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then, let's find another place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus started the car and left the restaurant parking lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seemingly aware of what was to come, Jade found her heart racing with anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' car sped through the streets under the night sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, the lights were dim, while inside, he had a beautiful woman for company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, they arrived at a deserted street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus tried to drive further down the street but was stopped by several armed men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frowning, he said to Jade, "Wait in the car. I'll check it out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew he was in trouble, but he wasn't sure where it was coming from.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Getting out of the car, he spotted a familiar figure. It was Joan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus instantly realized that it was Joan he had encountered earlier in the day while buying Tears of the Angel.</span></p><div class="pagination">
