  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overhearing snippets of chatter from curious onlookers, Marcus pieced together the story&mdash;Julian Ashford was in town, visiting </span><span>Solomia</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a senior government official&mdash;a heavyweight in national politics&mdash;Julian's visit naturally called for tight security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, a convoy of sleek, black </span><span>Maybachs</span><span> cruised down the street, with flashing police cars clearing the way. The atmosphere was electric.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Drivers pulled over, some whipping out their phones to snap photos or record videos, eager to capture the grandeur of Julian Ashford's impressive motorcade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus barely gave it a second thought and turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as he was about to step away, a faint yet unmistakable wave of deadly intent prickled at his senses, coming from the sealed-off road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, Marcus extended his spiritual powers, covering the entire area like an invisible web.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every detail of the road came into sharp focus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze locked onto figures hiding inside buildings along the road&mdash;civilians by appearance, but armed to the teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their attempts to blend in, Marcus caught them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, several seemed to be coordinating via walkie-talkies, lying in wait for Julian's motorcade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a textbook assassination plot, no question about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't know who was behind this, but as a patriot, there was no way he'd let someone take out a national leader on his watch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly parked his car and moved toward the road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, this area's off-limits! Turn around and head back now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could get any closer, two SWAT officers stepped in front of him, arms crossed and firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at the officers, then at the road. Time was running out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he activated his teleportation ability, disappearing before the officers could even blink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both SWAT officers froze, their jaws dropping. One rubbed his eyes as if trying to wake himself up, while the other muttered, "Did you see that? Or am I losing it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stunned crowd nearby shared their disbelief, and some even managed to record the surreal moment on their phones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus reappeared in the blink of an eye&mdash;now sitting calmly in the passenger seat of Julian's Maybach L5.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver yelped in shock, jerking the wheel slightly, while Julian's eyebrows shot up in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguard didn't hesitate, whipping out his gun and aiming directly at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the bodyguard could squeeze the trigger, an invisible force pinned him to his seat, his arms frozen mid-motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the Commander's vehicle! Who the hell are you?" the bodyguard growled through gritted teeth, his face turning red as he struggled against the pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave a casual shrug. "Relax, I'm not here to hurt anyone. Someone's planning to assassinate Commander Ashford, and I'm here to stop them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, Marcus had pieced together the situation. The attackers were almost certainly mercenaries hired by some overseas faction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's usually calm demeanor cracked slightly, his weathered eyes narrowing with intrigue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguard, still straining against the invisible force, scoffed, "Assassinate? You're out of your mind. We've already done a full security sweep and set up multiple checkpoints. No way anyone could get close enough to pull that off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring the bodyguard's skepticism, Marcus turned to the driver. "Keep driving. Oh, and don't freak out when I start firing, alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His spiritual powers had already locked onto the would-be assassins, tracking their every move with pinpoint precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, listen up. At the first intersection, there's a yellow building with three gunmen inside. After that, there's a nursery&mdash;third floor, elevator shaft&mdash;two snipers. Then, you've got a bank headquarters up ahead. Four more guys there, and they've got </span><span>grenades ready to blow this car to pieces..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus rattled off the positions of the attackers like he was reading from a map, his tone calm and matter-of-fact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguard's eyes narrowed, suspicion warring with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could this guy, who hadn't even been down the road, know all of this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Julian, known for his stoic composure, couldn't help but glance sideways at Marcus, his expression briefly betraying curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, no response came from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, as the Maybach rolled up to the first intersection, a sharp crack split the air&mdash;a gunshot.</span></p><div class="pagination">
