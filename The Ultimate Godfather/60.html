  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle's face turned red as she thought, "What's wrong with me? I've misinterpreted Mr. Fitzgerald's intentions again." So, she immediately started to rub Marcus vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle had a great massage technique. Marcus had noticed it the last time she rubbed his shoulders in the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's so good. Now, give me a rub on my right shoulder," Marcus said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Marcus was sitting on the right side, Michelle would have to straddle Marcus's body to reach his right shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having just misinterpreted Marcus' intentions, she didn't think much of it this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She directly straddled Marcus' body and started rubbing. "Mr. Fitzgerald, does it feel good?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this position, Marcus could clearly see Michelle's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus hadn't noticed before, but Michelle was quite well-endowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, from this angle, her skin was smoother than Marcus had imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Different from Diana's skin, Michelle's was radiant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, from this angle, he could vaguely see Michelle's areola.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the most beautiful areola Marcus had ever seen, pink and just the right size...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't help but swallow his saliva.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle was wearing a black professional skirt suit, and the black stockings on her lower body made her legs more shapely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' gaze turned, and in the reflection of the car window, he could see Michelle's high, protruding buttocks, which were round and full, a true peach butt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to the short skirt, Marcus could even see her underwear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you looking at, Mr. Fitzgerald?" Michelle felt a bit strange. Her pretty face turned red, and she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't answer. His big hand inexplicably placed on Michelle's peach butt and squeezed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mmm..." Michelle let out a light hum. Her body instinctively dodged, but Marcus directly pulled her delicate body into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other hand went straight to Michelle's clitoris.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of electric shock-like feelings swept through her body, Michelle's small mouth slightly open, her delicate body trembling, letting out an attractive pant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although separated by stockings, Marcus's fingers were still moist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald... no... what do you want to do?" A touch of red appeared on Michelle's pretty face, and her gaze towards Marcus became tender, with a bit of shyness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This pure and lustful feeling was Marcus' favorite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without speaking, Marcus directly kissed Michelle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle's eyes widened, never dreaming that her first kiss would be taken so unprepared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' tongue pried open Michelle's teeth and slowly stirred inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a short time, Michelle could only passively respond, her body becoming more and more hot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' big hand also became restless, constantly touching Michelle's clitoris, causing Michelle to continuously make attractive humming sounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald...stop. I can't stand it...ovulation period..." Michelle kept pleading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that women would want to do some indescribable things during their ovulation period.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a virgin couldn't withstand the touch of an old hand like Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Michelle was completely defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But afraid of being seen by others, Michelle still broke free from Marcus and said affectionately, "Mr. Fitzgerald, there are many people here...take me to a place where no one is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That voice was ethereal and soft, capable of arousing a man's most primitive desires.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't hesitate, got out of the car, came to the main driving position, started the vehicle, and sped away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed as if he was drawn by something magically irresistible, and Marcus drove at top speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than ten minutes, the car arrived at a mountainous area on the outskirts of Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the two were extremely tacit, quickly came to the back seat, kissed each other crazily, and kept tearing each other's clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I want you to love me..." Michelle was overwhelmed by desire, completely forgetting that she was still a virgin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, she just wanted to be filled by Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't bear this teasing. While touching Michelle's sensitive areas, he was preparing to take off his pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as the two were about to complete the final step, a series of footsteps were heard coming closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although they were at least dozens of feet away from the Alphard business car, Marcus' keen hearing could still sense it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, the other party's footsteps were steady, and each step had a special frequency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately realized that this person was a master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a bummer!" Facing this situation, Marcus could only quickly tidy up Michelle's clothes and said to her, "You stay in the car. Don't get off. I'll deal with it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being disturbed, Michelle also woke up from her lust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she looked at her own exposed appearance, her pretty face was blushed red, a bit afraid to look directly at Marcus, but she still nodded hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus got out of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he had guessed, at this moment, there was a figure walking towards this side not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This person was wearing a cowboy suit, full of muscles all over his body, and a fierce face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, from the aura released by this person, it was clear that the man was a warrior, and his cultivation had also reached the Ancient Martial Stage Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Did you come for me?" Marcus asked.</span></p><div class="pagination">
