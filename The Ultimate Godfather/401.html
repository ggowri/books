        <h1>Chapter 400 Encountering Robbers</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was ridiculous that people were so stupid that they mistook Scales for a big shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Besides, they kept saying all kinds of arrogant words to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' departure made these people feel relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, Marcus didn't punish them for their collision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But they didn't understand that Marcus didn't punish them because he disdained them and didn't want to bother with people like them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I'm so sorry. I didn't expect today's class reunion to end like this. I'm sorry for wasting your time..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the taxi, Catherine said to Marcus with an apologetic look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Holding her hand, Marcus said with a smile, "Don't think like that. If there hadn't been today's party, I wouldn't have known that there were already termites inside Golden Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There are too many people who want to get in by relying on connections and money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Scales is just one of them, so tomorrow I will reorganize the entire group. Only in this way can Golden Group continue to develop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Therefore, I should thank you for letting me discover the shortcomings in the management of the group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Marcus' words, Catherine gently fell into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus stroked Catherine's hair and sniffed the faint girlish fragrance coming from her body, feeling unusually calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let me take you home," Marcus said to Catherine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catherine nodded and said, "My parents went to the countryside to attend a wedding. There's no one at my home..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the taxi stopped at the community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The community was very old.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were few street lights in the community, and the ground was bumpy. All kinds of cars were parked haphazardly on both sides of the road, making it look messy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't move. Give me the money, or I'll kill you two!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they were crossing an alley, a cold voice came from behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus looked around and found that both ends of the alley were blocked. Several people holding knives and sticks surrounded them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't have money. Come on," Marcus said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words angered the thugs who were attempting to rob them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A thug said, "Fuck you! No money? I'll kill you first and then fuck this girl!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, several thugs rushed forward, waving their weapons and slashing at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catherine was frightened and screamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus protected her behind him and kept punching out with his fists. There was a sound of broken bones and the thugs screaming in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In just a few seconds, all the thugs were knocked to the ground by Marcus, howling in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus ignored them and called the police. After explaining the situation, he took Catherine away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, the community is not safe. I've heard that robberies often happen here before. This is the first time I've encountered this. If you weren't here today, I'm afraid I'd be finished."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catherine was still frightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The old community was generally not safe, and robbers were rampant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were often news reports about young girls being robbed, raped and murdered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll buy you a new house. You can't live here anymore. I'll be worried," Marcus said with a doting look on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't be with Catherine all the time, and he didn't want her to live in this environment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catherine bit her lip, wanting to refuse, but finally agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Besides her safety, her parents were old and it was very inconvenient for them to live in such an environment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, she secretly swore in her heart that she would return the money to Marcus after he got a job and earned money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus came to Catherine's home. Although he had been there once, he could still feel the oldness of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catherine poured a cup of water for Marcus and started cleaning the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at the girl's slim back, Marcus felt soft in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He embraced Catherine from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Um..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Being hugged suddenly, Catherine was caught off guard and her heart began to tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling the masculine scent coming from behind her, Catherine blushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before she could say anything, Marcus picked up her body and walked towards the bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catherine was nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although they had slept together before, it was the first time for them to do this at home, and her heart beat faster when she thought about what would happen later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, close the door." Catherine reminded Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There's no one at home. What are you afraid of?" Marcus laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under the dim light, Catherine's face looked more charming, and Marcus threw her on the bed.</span></p></div>
