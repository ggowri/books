        <h1>Chapter 689 Mission</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want? What exactly are you planning to do to me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of all this, Ada had an emotional breakdown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was consumed by contradictions, so much so that she didn't even know what she truly desired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling her inner conflict, Ada couldn't stand it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have no plan. It is up to you. If you want, you can be with me. If not, leave immediately, and I won't stop you," Marcus said calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada looked at Marcus solemnly and asked, "If I choose to be with you, will you treat me well all my life?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said sincerely, "I can't promise a lifetime, for I'm unsure of how long I'll live. However, as long as I'm alive, I will."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was never willing to make unrealistic promises, much less to lie to others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He only spoke of things he was sure he could do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada took a deep breath and said, "Forget it. I have a more arduous mission to fulfill. Now is not the time to talk about romance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't seem to make up her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked, "What is your mission?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To promote and expand Celestial Arc Order."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada's eyes were determined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the death of the head of Celestial Arc Order and other leaders, Ada had the responsibility to shoulder the responsibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at her excited look, Marcus felt a bit of admiration for Ada.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked, "Do you still hate me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada looked at Marcus and said, "Of course. You took what was most precious to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus cast a peculiar glance at her and said, "But you seem to be enjoying yourself just now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada blushed shyly and stared at him angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus realized that he had said something wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you killed the three guardians of the Bloodthirsty Cult, they will definitely not let you off. Be careful," Ada reminded Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said, "Don't worry. Within three days, I will destroy the Bloodthirsty Cult."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for the Bloodthirsty Cult's sneak attack on Yvonne, he would not have known this force in Southvaia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he and the Bloodthirsty Cult became enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To completely eliminate the threat, Marcus decided to take the initiative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' words touched Ada.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "I heard that the leader of the Bloodthirsty Cult has reached the realm of peak Curse Weaver. You'd better not go alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said with confidence, "I see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada didn't say anything more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she remembered something and asked Marcus, "Will you go to Morvalis on September 9th?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, see you on the fifth of September!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having said that, Ada turned and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus did not stop her and also left the illusion space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was almost dusk. The sun was setting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus first drove his Aston Martin back to Bayside Villa while thinking about the map.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simultaneously, in an uninhabited tropical rainforest in Southvaia, miasma hung thick in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The miasma was toxic, making it difficult for ordinary people to withstand. Once an ordinary person entered, they would be knocked unconscious and mysteriously returned to their starting point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, the area had been declared off-limits by many governments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For many years, very few people had ventured into it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amidst the miasma, there was a large illusion formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within the formation lay a different world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the base of the largest cult of Curse Weavers, the Bloodthirsty Cult, in Southvaia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The area was the size of a small city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the inhabitants within were members of the Bloodthirsty Cult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a colossal temple with a distinct Southvaia style, a middle-aged man clad in Curse Weaver's robes sat, surrounded by a crimson glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, three statues in the temple exploded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Curse Weaver opened his eyes suddenly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at the three statues with cold eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who killed my three guardians?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was cold and commanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Me!"</span></p></div>
