  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Well, well, if it isn't Chad!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Chad sent a message in the group chat, Jenson jumped in, his words dripping with sarcasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Yeah, it's me.] Chad replied casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[So, how've you been, Chad? You know, we go way back, high school and college classmates. That's a bond not just anyone can claim. But you've been so quiet for so long. I thought you'd disappeared off the face of the earth!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson's message, though devoid of emojis or exclamation points, carried a smugness so obvious it didn't need dressing up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group quickly caught on. Those who knew the long-standing tension between Jenson and Chad started spamming the chat with memes and reaction gifs, clearly entertained by the brewing drama.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sean Quinn, another classmate, chimed in with a meme of his own and a message dripping with mockery. [That's right! Jenson and Chad have a special relationship. Not your average friendship, LOL.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sarcasm hit like a slap, and the chat exploded with laughter. Everyone knew exactly who the joke was aimed at.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of being annoyed, Jenson seemed even more energized. [Come on, guys, don't tease him too much. What if he gets mad? Anyway, see you all at the reunion tomorrow. I'm logging off for some rest!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he stopped responding, leaving Chad fuming. His face was red with anger, but he had nowhere to vent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chad, don't stoop to their level. Let them have their moment. Tomorrow, we'll make them eat their words," Marcus said with a grin, trying to lighten the mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chad clenched his jaw but nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Marcus' phone buzzed with a new message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was from Natalie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Marcus, remember the other day when you offended Mrs. Jenkins at the shop? Who'd have thought she'd die just a few days later? Lucky for you, or you'd have been in serious trouble.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[What's your point?] Marcus replied lazily, clearly unimpressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie quickly followed up with two more messages. [Nothing much. Just a friendly warning. Keep a low profile at tomorrow's reunion. Sure, you've got some money now, but compared to Jenson, you're still way out of your league. Don't humiliate yourself.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[I'm only telling you this because you used to chase after me. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother wasting my breath.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus rolled his eyes and ignored her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, Marcus, I'm heading out to deliver some orders. This month's earnings are pitiful. If I don't hustle, I might not even cover my basic expenses," Chad said, standing up to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could go, Marcus pressed him back into his chair. "I told you already. You're sticking with me. No more delivery gigs. Got it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chad chuckled, clearly not taking him seriously. "Alright, boss, whatever you say. But it sounds like you haven't had enough to drink yet. Fine, I'll stay and drink with you till the end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he popped open another bottle of beer and poured Marcus a full glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's him, honey! He's the one who hit me. You've got to teach him a lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A shrill voice suddenly cut through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus and Chad turned their heads and saw a group of people storming toward them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the center was a woman, the same one who'd had the fender bender with Chad earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beside her was a burly, middle-aged man with a large belly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Jacob, the project manager of Bayside Petroleum Company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trailing behind them were over a dozen intimidating men, security guards from Bayside Petroleum Company, though they looked more like hired muscle than anything else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacob's eyes locked onto Marcus and Chad, narrowing dangerously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you're the punks who hit my wife's car and had the nerve to lay hands on her?" he demanded, his tone icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at him and asked flatly, "You work for Bayside Petroleum Company?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd overheard the name earlier during the roadside commotion but hadn't given it much thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had recently acquired Bayside Petroleum Company, though he hadn't had the chance to familiarize himself with the management yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacob sneered, clearly mistaking Marcus' question for fear. "That's right. And since you know who I am, you should also know you're in way over your head for hitting my woman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' expression remained calm as he asked, "What department are you in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm the manager of the Petroleum Transportation Division," Jacob replied smugly, clearly proud of his position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though not a high-ranking executive, his role came with plenty of perks, making him someone even higher-ups had to tread carefully around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop wasting time, honey! Teach them a lesson already. They dared to mess with me. Make them pay!" the woman snapped impatiently.</span></p><div class="pagination">
