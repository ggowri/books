        <h1>Chapter 768 The Death of Nathan</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the astonished gaze of the crowd, Marcus struck back against Alonzo's Hand Strike&nbsp;with a seemingly effortless Fist Ray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first glance, the punch appeared light, as if it carried no power at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, that gentle-looking Fist Ray&nbsp;intercepted Alonzo's destructive Hand Strike&nbsp;with precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A resounding boom echoed as the two forces collided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alonzo's lips curled into a sneer. He couldn't believe Marcus dared to challenge him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a surge of energy, Alonzo poured more destructive force into his attack, determined to annihilate Marcus completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his arrogance didn't last long.&nbsp;In moments, Alonzo felt an overwhelming power emanating from Marcus' Fist Ray. It was a force that seemed capable of obliterating everything in its path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That power engulfed his Hand Strike&nbsp;entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then came another deafening boom.&nbsp;In the face of Marcus' deceptively simple punch, Alonzo's Hand Strike shattered into dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' Fist Ray continued unabated, cutting through the void and slamming directly into Alonzo's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alonzo let out a blood-curdling scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body shot through the air like a cannonball, crashing into a towering iceberg with devastating force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact triggered a thunderous crack. The entire iceberg crumbled, collapsing into icy rubble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alonzo spat blood uncontrollably, his body trembling as he slid to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His chest had caved in, and all traces of his former arrogance were gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face now showed only fear and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pointing a shaking finger at Marcus, Alonzo stammered, "This...&nbsp;this can't be! How are you this powerful?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm an Ancient Martial Stage Nine expert! How could I lose to you? How is this possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Alonzo's body gave out entirely. He slumped lifelessly to the </span><span>ground,</span><span> his breath extinguished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air fell silent.&nbsp;Everyone stood frozen, staring in shock at the scene before them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not a single person could believe what they had just witnessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could have anticipated that Marcus would be able to defeat an Ancient Martial Stage Nine expert with a single blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers were stunned, their hearts trembling with fear as they looked at Marcus in utter horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Ada was left stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always known Marcus was powerful, someone who could easily dispatch opponents like Nathan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when she heard that Alonzo had reached Ancient Martial Stage Nine, even her faith in Marcus' abilities had wavered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, an expert at Stage Nine was considered invincible in their world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alonzo's breakthrough had cemented his status as the strongest in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>, the world of Ancient Martial Art.&nbsp;But now, Marcus had shattered that perception with one casual punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Marcus&nbsp;paid no mind to the shocked stares.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at the lifeless Alonzo, then casually took his Spatial Ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked over to Ada, gently caressing her swollen cheek in front of everyone. "Does it hurt?"&nbsp;he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada's body trembled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, she would have pulled away without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she had always maintained a pure and proud image in front of the experts in the world of Ancient Martial Art.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being touched like this in front of everyone clashed with her usual persona.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, all she did was tremble before lifting her face to meet Marcus' gaze. "It doesn't hurt," she said softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus channeled a thread of Timeless Numinous Energy into her cheek. The redness and swelling vanished instantly, leaving her skin flawless once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze shifted to Nathan, who was standing a short distance away, utterly petrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan had been completely broken by fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until moments ago, he believed that with Alonzo backing him, he could act as he pleased in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had thought that if Marcus dared to show himself, Alonzo would kill him without </span><span>a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what he never imagined was that the seemingly invincible Alonzo would fall so easily before Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alonzo hadn't even been able to take a single punch before being killed on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This shattered Nathan's entire worldview. Every belief he had crumbled under that single blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now his face was pale, filled with despair and terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus approached him with a cold expression. "You dared to lay a hand on my woman. Do you think I'd let you live? Killing you is the only way to appease my anger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, Marcus raised his hand. A beam of destructive light burst forth from his fingertips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It streaked through the air, striking Nathan squarely on the forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sickening explosion, Nathan's head burst into a cloud of blood and mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body collapsed to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd trembled once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could have imagined that the arrogant Nathan, who had been so full of himself, would meet such a tragic end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He said I'm his woman. Did he mean it?" Ada thought, her heart racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching the powerful figure before her, Ada bit her lip, feeling a surge of admiration for Marcus. He was so handsome, so commanding, and so reassuring. As she thought about it, her cheeks flushed slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had no idea what Ada was thinking.&nbsp;He scanned the remaining experts from </span><span>Uswad</span><span> with a calm, piercing gaze. "The space-time gate is about to open," he said. "But with your current abilities, entering it will almost certainly lead to your death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ada and I will be exploring the space-time gate&nbsp;together. If anyone wishes to follow, I won't stop you. But don't expect me to save you if you're in danger. Make your decision wisely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Marcus turned back to Ada. Taking her hand gently, he asked, "Shall we explore the space-time gate together?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada didn't resist. Instead, she tightened her grip on his hand and nodded eagerly. "I'm willing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Marcus and Ada disappeared into the vast ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining experts in </span><span>Uswad</span><span> exchanged uncertain looks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some chose to stay behind, giving up the chance to explore the space-time gate. Others, driven by ambition or desperation, dove into the ocean, chasing after Marcus and Ada.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam, who had lived a samsara, had worked his way up to become the leader of the Swords Sect through his own wisdom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Based on the immense power Marcus had just demonstrated, Liam believed Marcus' words to be highly credible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that in Marcus' eyes, they posed no threat to him, and there was no reason for him to deceive them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Liam decided to stay where he was and observe the results of Marcus and the </span><span>others entering the space-time gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He planned to gather experience so that the next time the space-time gate opened, he would be prepared to venture inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of the others, eager to explore the space-time gate, were already making their move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They dove into the ocean, heading toward the deep-sea rift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, with their current cultivation, they couldn't even reach the bottom before succumbing to the pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And those who managed to press on met their ends at the hands of countless unseen dangers.</span></p></div>
