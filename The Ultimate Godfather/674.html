  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to resist, Marcus pressed Diana beneath him and kissed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I was talking about something important, and here you go again?" Diana let out a light hum, her cheeks flushed with heat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's because you're too beautiful," Marcus said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Marcus' passionate kiss, Diana quickly responded, her body turning soft and pliant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus got into the right position and then started to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana let out a loud cry and fell into endless desire again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus began to move back and forth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They quickly fell into the sea of endless delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, it lasted for about an hour and a half before Marcus completely exploded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana reached climax six times in a row. Her body collapsed weakly on the bed, and she fell into a deep sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sat cross-legged, continuing to solidify his cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Early the next morning, Diana woke up early.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a quick wash-up, she went straight to the kitchen to get busy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had to be said that this woman was not only powerful and capable of anything, but her cooking skills were also top-notch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Diana's arrival, Marcus had been enjoying delicious meals every day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Marcus, at his current level of cultivation, could survive without food by relying on his Numinous Energy, occasionally satisfying his appetite was still a great way to relax.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoosh!" Just as Marcus, Diana, Pearl, and Jane were having breakfast, a sharp dart flew in through the gap in the window and directly pierced into the cabinet door!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes narrowed, and his gaze followed the dart. He noticed a piece of paper stuck to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly walked over, pulled the dart out of the cabinet door, and unfolded the paper to read.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"On September 9th, the door to the Morvalis Ice Wall's space-time gate will open. The world of Ancient Martial Art invites friends to join in exploring the space-time gate. If you are interested, please gather at the peak of the Divine Mount before September 5th!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is what was written on the note.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The paper was signed with the name Liam Sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was unfamiliar with this name. After thinking for a while, he remembered that Liam was likely the leader of one of the three major sects in the world of Ancient Martial Art, the Swords Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What surprised and delighted Marcus was that just yesterday, Diana had reminded him to search for the Return Essence Crystal before reaching the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, the space-time gate in the Morvalis Ice Wall was going to open on September 9th.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today was August 29th, meaning there were still 10 days until September 9th.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to Liam's invitation, Marcus needed to gather at the Divine Mount by September 5th, which meant he had only six days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though six days wasn't much, it was enough for Marcus to make the necessary preparations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What also surprised him was that Liam, as the leader of Swords Sect, had taken the initiative to invite him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Marcus had never made a point of interacting with people from the world of Ancient Martial Art, the news of him killing the leaders of the Astral Serpent Order and Celestial Arc Order had likely spread throughout the martial world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This must have been one of the key reasons why Liam extended the invitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, regardless of the reason behind the invitation, Marcus was determined to attend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, this matter involved the Return Essence Crystal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without it, even if his cultivation reached the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Nine, he wouldn't be able to advance further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus handed the paper to Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's beautiful eyes gleamed as she said, "It seems Liam has some skills if he can predict the exact time the space-time gate of the Morvalis Ice Wall will open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, Mr. Fitzgerald, if you want to participate, you must be cautious. I suspect that they wouldn't just invite you to share the opportunity so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He must have his own agenda."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded faintly, replying, "Don't worry, I have it under control."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded in relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Marcus had finished his meal, he received a phone call from Shannon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's up?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon's voice was urgent as she replied, "Mr. Fitzgerald, are you busy? Someone has come to challenge Iron Fist Club. Since Ewan left, there aren't many strong masters left in the club. Ms. Perkins can't hold up against their repeated challenges. I don't have any good options left, so if you have time, could you come help us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' brows furrowed slightly as he asked, "Who is challenging you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon replied, "It's the Wild Bull Fighting Club from the same city."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll be there in ten minutes," Marcus answered calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could tell that Shannon was genuinely anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Worried that she might get hurt because of this, Marcus saw no reason to refuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He got into his Aston Martin and arrived at the Iron Fist Club in just ten minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the Iron Fist Club was filled with people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes were all focused on the arena in the center of the venue.</span></p><div class="pagination">
