  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't even spare the cyborgs a glance. He casually unleashed two blasts of Fist Ray, and with a deafening boom, the shockwaves tore through the air.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under Marcus' attack, the two cyborgs exploded on the spot, their bodies bursting apart into chunks of flesh and scattered mechanical debris. The gruesome sight made Joel's blood run cold.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Joel was completely dumbfounded. "S-stop... Don't come any closer!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three fifth-generation cyborgs he had been so proud of turned out to be nothing more than scrap metal before Marcus. With just a flick of his wrist, Marcus had annihilated them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And as for the intricate trap Joel had meticulously set up? It hadn't even slowed Marcus down. At this moment, Joel had played all his cards&mdash;there was nothing left for him to fall back on.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus paid Joel no mind. He reached out and clamped a hand around Joel's throat, lifting him clean off the ground with sheer brute force. Then, turning his gaze toward Cecilia, Marcus asked, "I've got him for you, Cecilia. What do you want to do with him?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecilia stood frozen in place, completely stunned. Not even in her wildest dreams had </span><span>she imagined that Marcus could single-handedly dismantle everything Joel had set up so effortlessly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before she could say a word, Rhett's trembling voice cut through the silence from not far away. "He may have committed unspeakable crimes, but no matter what, he's still my blood. I can't bear to see him die... Let him spend the rest of his life rotting in the dungeons!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't agree immediately, though. Instead, he turned his gaze back to Cecilia. To him, everyone in the McHale family was an outsider&mdash;everyone except for her. She was the only one he considered a friend.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecilia glanced at her grandfather before giving Marcus a slight nod. "Let's do as my grandpa says, Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus gave a slight nod in response. Without hesitation, two men from the McHale family stepped forward and swiftly bound Joel, tying him up tightly with thick ropes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they restrained him, Joel thrashed violently, his voice ringing with desperation. "What the hell do you think you're doing? Let go of me right now! I am the head of this family! You people have no right&mdash;this is outrageous!" His face twisted with </span><span>rage,</span><span> his eyes bloodshot. He was on the verge of losing his mind, unable to accept that the power he had clung to so desperately was slipping through his fingers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Tobias, Luna, and Albert stood rooted to the spot, shivering in fear. None of them had expected Marcus to be this terrifyingly strong. He had obliterated Joel's entire defense system as if it was nothing. They couldn't even see Marcus as human anymore&mdash;he was stronger than the most overpowered heroes in action movies.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luna and Albert, in particular, felt a deep, gut-wrenching fear settle in. The more they thought about how they had acted so smugly in front of Marcus earlier, the more their stomachs twisted with regret. A bone-chilling dread seeped into their veins, making their limbs go numb.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Albert's eyes darted around as he quickly hatched a plan. If he stayed, he was doomed. Moving as discreetly as possible, he edged toward the banquet hall's exit, step by step, trying to slip away unnoticed into the night.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, before he could get far, Marcus' cold voice rang out. "Stop right there!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Albert froze as if he'd been struck by lightning, his entire body trembling. He didn't dare take another step. Cold sweat dripped from his forehead as he looked at Marcus, his eyes filled with sheer terror.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus let out a chilling laugh, asking, "Didn't you say you were going to make me suffer? That you'd make me pay the ultimate price? And now you think you can just walk away? Do you really think that's possible?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To be honest, Marcus had never really taken Albert seriously. But the man was like a persistent fly, constantly buzzing around, refusing to go away. And now, he had even involved himself in the McHale Pharmaceuticals Group's internal power struggle. That alone sealed his fate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Albert's face turned deathly pale as he begged for mercy, "I... I was wrong... I swear, I know I was wrong! Marcus, please, just let me go..." He even attempted to bolt from the banquet hall when Marcus wasn't paying attention.</span></p><div class="pagination">
