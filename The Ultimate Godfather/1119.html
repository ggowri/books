        <h1>Chapter 993 Against Her Heart-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie bit her lip shyly upon hearing his words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She naturally understood the meaning behind Marcus's words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because this wasn't the first time Marcus had healed her, and every time he did, some</span><span>thing</span><span> indescribable</span><span> would happened to </span><span>her body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That made her unable to resist, and many times, she would even take the initiative to seek it from Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Gertie's cheeks couldn't help but flush slightly, and her heartbeat quickened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But her injuries were indeed severe, and without timely treatment, it could leave lasting </span><span>damage </span><span>and seriously impact her future cultivation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mm, I'm fine, I can definitely hold on</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>N</span><span>o problem at all!" Gertie thought to herself, unable to resist cheering herself up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then she sat cross-legged on the bed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus approached the bed, saw Gertie still dressed, and said, "</span><span>D</span><span>o I still need to remind you</span><span> how it is done</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie, being a very smart girl, instantly understood what Marcus was talking about.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her cheeks flushed, and she raised her hand to start unbuttoning.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In no time, she slowly took off her top, leaving only a white bra.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those two ample breasts were extraordinarily large, seemingly too much for the white bra to support.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this okay?" Gertie asked, her face flushed with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I told you before, during the treatment, you can't have any clothing on, or it will affect the results."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus said calmly, this wasn't his deliberate request but a characteristic of Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as clothing obstructs, even if it's not in the area where he transmits Numinous Energy, it will still affect the energy transfer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie had no choice but to slowly unhook her bra.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A pair of large, snow-white breasts bounced free, completely exposed to the air.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her breasts were large and plump with no signs of sagging They are </span><span>firm and perky to an almost unbelievable degree</span><span>, especially the two nipples</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her areolas were especially pink, like the skin of a newborn baby.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although this wasn&rsquo;t Marcus's first time seeing her breasts, it seemed that because he hadn&rsquo;t seen them for a long time, his gaze immediately froze there the moment he saw them again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling Marcus's fiery gaze, Gertie's pretty face turned bright red as she asked, "You big jerk, we agreed this was just for treatment. What are you looking at?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus scratched his head and said awkwardly, "I'm checking the injuries in your body. Don't I need to take a look?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie could only roll her eyes helplessly and let him admire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Marcus didn&rsquo;t let this delay her treatment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He immediately sat cross-legged opposite Gertie and began channeling the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Strands of Timeless Numinous Energy swirled around him, enveloping his body in a layer of white mist.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Timeless Numinous Energy was truly magical; as soon as it was released, it invigorated Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, he placed his hand on her soft and silky skin. While he deliberately avoided her breasts, he could still felt how perky they were.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment Marcus touched Gertie's skin, her delicate body trembled slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, an incredibly intense Timeless Numinous Energy flowed through her skin into her body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie's body trembled uncontrollably. She felt an indescribable sense of comfort spreading throughout her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Timeless Numinous Energy entered her body, coursing through various energy channels, then converging at Gertie's injured area, continuously repairing the damaged tissues.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As more Timeless Numinous Energy flowed in, that wonderful sensation arrived as expected.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie couldn't help but tremble slightly, letting out soft hums.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her face flushed crimson, complementing her delicate features and adding even more charm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hold on, I'm going to </span><span>intensify</span><span> the Numinous Energy input," Marcus reminded.</span></p></div>
