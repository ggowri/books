        <h1>Chapter 463 Black Dragon Society</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just wait," Easton sneered, his voice dripping with venom. "My master, Johnathan, is a ninja from the Black Dragon Society. You've killed him, and the Black Dragon Society won't let this go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Easton hoisted Johnathan's lifeless body over his shoulder and stormed off the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd erupted in a deafening roar, the noise echoing through the air as every eye in the arena turned to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shouts of admiration rang out from all sides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was clear that without Marcus, Easton would have continued his arrogant rampage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These two fights had been cathartic for the onlookers, and they were starting to realize that powerful figures had been in their midst all along&mdash;people who simply didn't flaunt their abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus, calm and composed as ever, stepped down from the arena, ready to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But before he could walk away, a striking figure approached him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was Shannon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you need something?" Marcus asked, raising an eyebrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shannon was no stranger to physical prowess, but as Marcus looked at her now, he couldn't help but notice how stunning she was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her physique, the result of years of disciplined training, was impressive&mdash;toned, fit, with curves that were anything but ordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unlike most women, Shannon's muscles didn't detract from her femininity; they added to it, giving her an aura of strength and vitality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her skin was sun-kissed, giving her a radiant, earthy glow that immediately caught the eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm Shannon, a member of the Tiger Fist Fighting Club," she said, extending a hand with a smile. "I'd like to introduce myself and maybe get to know you better, if you're interested?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus took her hand, returning her smile politely. "Marcus Fitzgerald," he replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, your fighting skills are truly exceptional," Shannon said, her eyes sparkling with admiration. "I'd love to invite you to our club sometime to exchange some insights. It would be an honor to learn from you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two battles he'd just fought had thoroughly impressed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew that Marcus' strength was on another level, a rarity even in the elite fighting circles of Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Making a connection with someone like him would be invaluable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I appreciate the offer," Marcus said with a small smile, "but I have other matters to attend to today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shannon's smile faltered slightly, a hint of disappointment in her eyes, but she quickly recovered. "Well, how about this? To thank you for your help today, let me take you out to dinner sometime. You wouldn't refuse a meal, would you, Mr. Fitzgerald?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus chuckled. "If I have time, I'd be glad to."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They exchanged contact information, and after a final smile, Marcus turned and walked to his car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he drove off, Shannon watched him go, her eyes lingering on the sleek Aston Martin he was driving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unlike many high-profile individuals who flaunted the latest flashy brands, Marcus had chosen something understated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An Aston Martin might not scream attention like a Ferrari, but it exuded quiet luxury&mdash;a quality that Shannon found particularly appealing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It fit perfectly with the impression Marcus gave&mdash;powerful, but humble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After leaving the arena, Marcus drove to Serpent's Coil to check on Jalen and the others' progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jalen, he discovered, was already on par with a Level Three Wizard, a jump that had Marcus impressed&mdash;especially considering how quickly he had advanced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other members of his magic squad had also improved significantly, with some on the verge of breaking through to Level Two Wizard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Edgar from the Seven Stars Association had reached Ancient Martial Art Stage One, and with his battle experience, he was now capable of taking on even the strongest in that tier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus was impressed with how quickly things were coming together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a few more weeks of training, Jalen would be ready to pass down his skills, particularly Lightning and Firebolt, to the rest of the team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In no time, Marcus expected Serpent's Coil to have a solid group of Level One Wizards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While Level One Wizards weren't much of a challenge against the absolute top-tier fighters, Marcus knew that with this kind of rapid development, Serpent's Coil would soon become a force to be reckoned with across Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Given that Marcus had recently eliminated a few high-profile enemies, he had more than enough healing pills in his Spatial Ring to further aid their progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He handed them over to Jalen to distribute among the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With those pills, their training would accelerate, and before long, they'd be ready for whatever challenges lay ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, word of Johnathan's death quickly reached the Black Dragon Society, the largest and most powerful ninja organization in Crankhurst.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The news of their top-tier ninja's demise sent shockwaves through their ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Black Dragon Society's response was swift and furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the most feared ninja organization, their operatives were revered and respected worldwide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This killing was an outright challenge to their power, and the higher-ups immediately ordered the dispatch of their strongest members to Uswad to seek vengeance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unbeknownst to Marcus, the storm was already brewing on the horizon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back at Bayside Villa, Marcus began his training with the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was lost in concentration when, around 5:00 PM, his phone buzzed. It was a message from Shannon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>[Mr. Fitzgerald, do you have some free time this evening? I'd love to invite you out for dinner.]</span></p></div>
