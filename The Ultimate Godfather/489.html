  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon sighed, her tone laced with frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Doesn't that just prove how outstanding you are?" Marcus teased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, could you stop teasing me?" Shannon retorted, exasperated. "If I were really that amazing, would I still be single? This time, the person they're introducing is a returnee from overseas. Apparently, he comes from a well-off family. His parents run a business in Kingston, and he's just been hired with a generous salary at the Golden Group's pharmaceutical industrial park."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon didn't see Marcus as an outsider and spilled everything without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, he does sound impressive. Maybe you should give him a chance?" Marcus chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh, Mr. Fitzgerald, can you be serious for once? If I were interested, I wouldn't need your help in the first place," Shannon said, clearly irritated. "A returnee, a PhD in medicine... he probably looks like a typical bookworm. I haven't met him, but I can already imagine the type. I'm not into guys like that. They're all intellect and</span><span> have</span><span> no grit. I prefer someone sporty with a bit of fire in them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catching the hint in her words, Marcus asked, "So what exactly do you want me to do here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon let out a mischievous laugh. "It's simple. Mr. Fitzgerald, you just pretended to be my boyfriend for a day. Come with me to meet my uncle and aunt. Once they see I already have someone, that returnee will back off for sure. Otherwise, they'll keep bothering me, and I'm already dreading it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh..." Marcus rubbed his forehead. He had already guessed what Shannon wanted from her tone, but hearing it confirmed left him speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long ago, Yvonne had roped Marcus into pretending to be her boyfriend, which ended with him getting on the wrong side of Haley. Now Shannon was making the same request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't help but wonder, "What's going on with girls these days? Is marriage really that unappealing now? Or are there just too few decent men left out there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, please? I'm begging you. There's really no one else I can ask!" Shannon pleaded, her voice soft and sugary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcus hadn't witnessed her fierce battles in the ring, he might have mistaken her for a sweet and delicate girl who loved to pout and charm her way through life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why not take Ewan with you? He'd be a perfect choice," Marcus said with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon said, "Mr. Fitzgerald, don't even mention Ewan! I almost forgot. Just two days ago, he had both his arms slashed. Word is, it was the Kingston Axe Gang! The whole thing is the talk of the Iron Fist Club. Ewan's a provincial fighting champion, yet he couldn't handle the underground thugs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon sighed with sympathy. Ewan had helped her in the past, and naturally, she didn't wish for anything bad to happen to h</span><span>im.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's not surprising," Marcus replied calmly. "Ring fights and timed street brawls are two very different things. Those underground types are ruthless, desperate, and have nothing to lose. It's only natural Ewan would struggle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Marcus didn't reveal was that he had orchestrated the entire incident. But there was no reason for Shannon to know that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's not talk about him," Shannon said, shaking her head. "Mr. Fitzgerald, you're seriously my last hope. I'll treat you to something even better next time to repay you. Please?" Her voice softened again as she coaxed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What time?" Marcus finally asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Marcus agree, Shannon perked up immediately. "Two in the afternoon! It's 12:30 now. Mr. Fitzgerald, where are you? I'll come pick you up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus shared his location, and in less than 15 minutes, Shannon arrived at the Aston Martin service center in her Porsche 718.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, over here!" Shannon called out, waving as she pulled up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus got into the car, settling in as Shannon started driving. Along the way, she briefed him about her uncle and aunt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're both pharmaceutical engineers," Shannon explained. "Right now, they work as department heads in the design division of Kingston BioFusion Pharmaceuticals. Not only are they highly educated, but together, their annual income is ten million dollars. Even in Kingston, they're considered top earners."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon continued, "Most of their connections are in the pharmaceutical industry, and the guy they're introducing me to today is no exception. He's a medical PhD, and his parents are successful professionals in medical equipment sales."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had agreed to meet at a well-known fine dining restaurant in Solomia called Le Vieux Ch&acirc;teau. Located on the city's most bustling street, it boasted an upscale menu with an average cost of over a thousand dollars per person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they arrived, Shannon pulled into the parking lot. A valet promptly took her car to a reserved spot while another staff member guided them to a luxurious private room on the third floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, Shannon's uncle, Kyle, and aunt, Penny, were already seated, along with a slim young man wearing glasses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Shannon walked in, Kyle and Penny smiled, "Shannon, there you are!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
