  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the immense pressure, the soldiers gradually felt their breaths becoming constricted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their bodies trembled, and many were forced to crawl on the ground. Their eyes were filled with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some even bled from their ears and noses, dying on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene left Nolan and the two Swords Sect warriors completely stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never expected that Marcus possessed such power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible? How could you have such incredible strength?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan, sitting in his wheelchair, was filled with astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish speaking, Marcus had already stepped forward. Like a ghost, he appeared before Nolan in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan instinctively threw a punch, trying to push Marcus back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus grasped Nolan's wrist instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan struggled with all his might but could not break free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a casual twist, the sound of bones snapping echoed. Nolan's wrist was broken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a piercing scream and turned to the two Swords Sect warriors for help, saying, "Save me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the two warriors could act, Marcus had already snapped Nolan's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan's eyes widened, and his body slumped helplessly in the wheelchair, lifeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Up until the moment of his death, his eyes remained open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dared to kill a disciple of the Swords Sect. Are you going to become an enemy of the Swords Sect?" One of the warriors asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized that Marcus' strength was not as simple as it appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even your sect leader, Liam Sky, would not dare to speak to me in such a manner. You truly have some nerve," Marcus said with a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason he did not immediately kill the two was entirely out of respect for Liam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the incident at </span><span>Morvalis</span><span>' space-time gate, Liam had treated him with considerable respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, Marcus did not want to kill members of the Swords Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing Marcus' words, the two warriors wore mocking expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them scoffed, "What a joke! I admit I underestimated your power, but you </span><span>don't think your strength surpasses our sect leader's, do you? You're just dreaming."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other one sneered, "Stop wasting time talking to him. Let's join forces and eliminate him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Marcus had showcased impressive strength, the two still believed that if they worked together, they had enough power to take him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before they could act, a majestic voice resounded in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice was transmitted through sound waves, meaning the speaker might be extremely far away, even thousands of miles away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, to the two warriors, it sounded as if it was right next to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Importantly, only Marcus and the two Swords Sect warriors could hear this voice. Others could not.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing the familiar voice, the two warriors were stunned and then showed respectful expressions. They looked up at the sky and asked, "Mr. Sky, is that you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who else could it be?" Liam responded through telepathy, his voice carrying a chilly intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Sky, what do you want us to do?" The two asked respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two idiots. If I had not intervened in time, you would have caused a great disaster."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam's voice contained authority, resonating in the minds of the two warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confused, they asked Liam, "Mr. Sky, we do not know what trouble we have caused. Please tell us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam replied, "You dared to disrespect Mr. Fitzgerald. You deserve to die a thousand deaths. Hurry and apologize to Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two warriors were taken aback and involuntarily looked at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them asked Liam, "Mr. Sky, who is Mr. Fitzgerald? Could it be..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had begun to suspect but didn't dare confirm it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two fools. Is there anyone besides Mr. Fitzgerald there?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have offended him today. If Mr. Fitzgerald holds a grudge, not only will you suffer, but the Swords Sect could also be implicated. Even I am powerless before Mr. Fitzgerald. With a wave of his hand, he could annihilate me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apologize to Mr. Fitzgerald immediately. If you cannot obtain his forgiveness, I will ensure your demise even from a distance of a thousand miles," Liam said through gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Swords Sect already had some minor friction with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To quell these frictions, Liam had to lower his tone and appease Marcus to calm his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had just established a good relationship with Marcus, and now these two had offended him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Liam feel an impulse to crush those two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Liam's words, the two warriors fell into despair, their eyes filled with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never imagined that Marcus' bravado was actually true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their eyes, the normally imposing Liam showed such respect towards Marcus, </span><span>which they found unbelievable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam was a powerful figure and his strength was in Ancient Martial Stage Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their minds, Liam was almost like a deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The normally imposing Liam was showing such respect to someone in his twenties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This completely shattered their perception.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two began to slap their own faces and apologized, "Mr. Fitzgerald, we were wrong. We were ignorant. We hope you won't hold it against us and let us go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus ignored the ignorant fools.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam's voice came through again. "Mr. Fitzgerald, it is my fault for not managing my subordinates well. Please do not take it out on them. If there is an opportunity, I will personally apologize to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied coolly, "No need. Manage your disciples well. Next time I won't hold back." With that, Marcus turned and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus leave, the two felt as if a weight had been lifted and quickly left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Marcus had told Melina to wait in the villa, she was very curious about what was happening outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pulled back the curtains and witnessed everything occurring outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She too was shocked by Marcus' display of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with hundreds of armed warriors, Marcus still effortlessly killed Gabriel and Nolan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such dominance far exceeded Melina's imagination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Marcus returned to the villa, he called Lydia, asking her to send people to handle the aftermath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus' personal assistant, Lydia was very skilled at such tasks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, she arrived with the Special Advisor Department, using the military's powerful influence to suppress all news.</span></p><div class="pagination">
