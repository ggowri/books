        <h1>Chapter 403 It Hurts</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Pearl is gone. We can continue."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't want to miss this wonderful moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had been liking Diana for long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two had flirted several times, and even almost slept together, but each time they were delayed by other things, which made Marcus very upset.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To be honest, Diana was the most beautiful of all the women Marcus had met. Perhaps only Maxine could compete with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maxine and Diana were of different types, but their beauty was both attractive, so Marcus didn't want to miss Today's opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, don't be like this. Jane will be back soon from shopping. Don't..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana still felt a little uncomfortable and didn't want anyone to see it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Marcus didn't give her a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before she could finish her words, Marcus had already gone into her private parts and completely occupied her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah..." Diana screamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She almost fainted because of the tearing sensation coming from her lower body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It hurts... Mr. Fitzgerald. How can you be so rude?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana glared at Marcus with a resentful look, trying to pull out the thing with her hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus chuckled and would not let her succeed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He exerted force on his waist and began to move in and out slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana let out a gasping sound, and the stimulation from her lower body made her feel an unprecedented sense of comfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The comfort quickly replaced the previous feeling of tearing. Every impact brought a strong wave of happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was pushed against the wall by Marcus. As her lower body became gradually wet, the amplitude of Marcus' thrusting increased little by little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt the swelling sensation in her lower body spread throughout her body, causing her to moan involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her voice was very alluring and intoxicating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, Marcus kissed her neck madly. The sensitive nerves on her neck were stimulated little by little by the tip of his tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every stimulation felt like an electric current flowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From her neck to the collarbone, then to her breasts, Marcus didn't want to miss every inch of Diana's skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The charge from below was getting more and more intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, you are so rude... You took possession of me without my consent... You are so bad..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Diana twisted her body desperately, Marcus held her fingers, thrusting and kissing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His male hormones exploded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly turned Diana's body around so that her hands were on the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus saw her attractive buttocks, and inside the buttocks was a charming part.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He went into it again, and this posture seemed to be able to reach the deepest organs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana screamed louder and began to beg for mercy. "Mr. Fitzgerald, please let me go. I can't take it anymore..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps because it was her first time doing this, Diana's endurance was not as good as other women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After just a few rounds of charges from Marcus, Diana had experienced multiple orgasms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her lower body contracted wildly, and fluid flowed down her long legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her skin was rosy, with fine beads of sweat oozing out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus knew that a woman for the first time couldn't withstand such a fierce attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He picked up Diana's body and placed her on the sink, spreading her legs apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her private parts were visible, and then he went into them again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This posture was Marcus' favorite. With every thrust, he could see Diana moaning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The senses of touch, hearing, smell, and vision allowed Marcus to experience a deeper level of stimulation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't bear it any longer and moved madly. After a violent burst of thrusting, he ejaculated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana also reached her fifth orgasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two of them hugged each other, breathing heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, they didn't know that when they were making love, there was a figure in the living room, rubbing her private parts with her hands while moaning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This person was Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane returned to Bayside Villa half an hour ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing the sounds in the bathroom, she was also interested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her desire was aroused and she couldn't help masturbating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Marcus roared, Jane's hand moved faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As her hand movements accelerated, her body twitched. Her lower body contracted, and she felt relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a while, hearing the sound of water in the bathroom, Jane hurried back to her room as if she didn't want to be discovered by Marcus and Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, it hurts down there. Why are you so rude?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked at Marcus lovingly. Although she was questioning him, her voice was very seductive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You are too beautiful. I can't bear it, so I have to speed up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus laughed and pinched Diana's butt.</span></p></div>
