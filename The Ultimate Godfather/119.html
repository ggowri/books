Left with no choice, he swung a punch skyward in defiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deafening explosion reverberated through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's body shook violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The oppressive force surged through him, pinning him as though he bore the weight of a mountain. His feet sank into the ground under the strain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still not dead?!" Ricardo snarled, his expression wild with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricardo's face twisted with madness as he poured more Numinous Energy into the palm strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's bones made a disjointed crack as the pressure forced him to collapse to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew the gap in power between himself and Ricardo was immense&mdash;he was at a clear disadvantage in direct combat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, Ricardo's strength was far beyond what Marcus had anticipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus on the ground, Ricardo launched another devastating strike, intent on ending his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus rolled away just in time, dodging several meters to the side as the strike landed, leaving a deep crater where he had been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of a peak Ancient Martial Stage Three warrior was terrifying. There was no exaggeration in saying Ricardo was the strongest opponent Marcus had ever faced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All his previous enemies combined wouldn't amount to even a fifth of Ricardo's strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For someone at the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Two, you've held out surprisingly long," Ricardo said, a hint of admiration in his voice. "But you still won't leave here alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricardo nodded slightly, now understanding why the subordinates he had sent before had all been killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strength Marcus displayed now could even rival that of someone at the early stages of Ancient Martial Stage Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Ricardo could attack again, flames ignited in Marcus's palm, and he unleashed a Fireball.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The searing flames shot toward Ricardo like a lightning bolt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricardo's face registered shock as he exclaimed, "You're a Wizard?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, he showed no fear. With a casual punch, he shattered Marcus's Fireball.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't let up, following with a burst of Lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying bolt of lightning tore through the void, striking directly above Ricardo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Ricardo's body merely trembled slightly, showing no significant damage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lightning? Ha, interesting. I wonder how many tricks you're hiding," Ricardo sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He </span><span>advanc</span><span>ed</span><span> like an unstoppable giant toward Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With every step, he launched another attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't dare face them head-on and dodged left and right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking advantage of Ricardo's momentary distraction, Marcus retrieved several magic crystals from his Spatial Ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chanting under his breath, the magic crystals unleashed dazzling magical attacks, enveloping Ricardo completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A barrage of magical attacks rained down, and for the first time, a serious expression appeared on Ricardo's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected Marcus to possess so many magic crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Magic crystals were typically consumables, capable of unleashing only a single attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of these attacks far exceeded what an ordinary Wizard could produce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crystals Marcus used carried the strength of a Wizard at Ancient Martial Stage Three unleashing their full power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The simultaneous onslaught of magical attacks posed a significant challenge for Ricardo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricardo's body trembled violently as he quickly released Numinous Energy to counter the attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thunderous booms echoed continuously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Magic clashed with Numinous Energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricardo managed to completely neutralize the barrage of magical attacks through sheer force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's expression darkened slightly. Ricardo's strength far exceeded anything he had imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, these magic crystals were one of Marcus's last resorts for survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had used them in hopes of quickly gaining the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, they had failed to inflict the damage he had anticipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricardo looked a bit disheveled but had lost none of his combat strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, the attacks had only fueled his rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Empowered by his fury, Ricardo's combat strength seemed to grow even more formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each strike carried enough force to pose a fatal threat to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, Marcus was forced to retreat, sustaining severe injuries. Blood trickled continuously from the corner of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give it up, kid! Against absolute power, all your tricks are useless!" Ricardo sneered coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricardo's chilling laughter accompanied an ominous and terrifying aura radiating from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He struck again, his palm print descending in front of Marcus. Marcus countered using the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire combined with his Fire Attribute Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the impact sent Marcus flying, blood spurting violently from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricardo refused to give Marcus any chance to recover, stepping forward again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, he appeared before Marcus, channeling all his energy into his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricardo's palm radiated a terrifying light. The concentrated Numinous Energy within carried overwhelming destructive power as it hurtled toward Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see how you handle this!" Ricardo shouted, his face alight with madness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This attack was Ricardo's trump card, containing everything he had&mdash;it was meant to obliterate Marcus completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the destructive force loomed closer, Marcus's expression remained surprisingly calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the attack was about to land, a faint, enigmatic smile appeared on Marcus's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Die!" Ricardo roared, throwing all his strength into the strike aimed to destroy Marcus.</span></p><div class="pagination">
