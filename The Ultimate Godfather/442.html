        <h1>Chapter 441 Captain Miles Donovan</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Keep an eye on him. We can't let him get away. He's taken down so many of our people!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lucas heard Jane and Marcus talking, and immediately chimed in with a warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Christopher's expression turned serious, and he quickly ordered his men to lock the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lucas sneered, "Now I really want to see where you think you're going. Once the Ganston SWAT team gets here, you're as good as dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus looked at Lucas with a strange expression. "How do you know the one who's going to die is me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His tone was full of arrogance and sarcasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Lucas could respond, Tristan stepped in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I didn't think you'd still be talking tough at a time like this. About to meet your end and still acting like this&mdash;I'll give you credit for being a tough guy. Do you even understand what the SWAT team is? You really think your amateur skills can stop them? Even if you're strong, are you stronger than a bullet? You can still avoid a beating, though. Kneel and apologize now, and I'll have the SWAT team go easy on you. Otherwise, you're going to regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At these words, Tracy, Lucas, Simon, and the others all started laughing, their eyes filled with smug satisfaction as they looked at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well, if you're so confident, I'll just be here waiting. Let's see what your so-called SWAT team can do to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus looked coolly at Tristan, his smirk widening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tristan raised an eyebrow, then chuckled derisively. "Alright, very well. If you're still this cocky after all this, I guess I'll have to show you just how wrong you are."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long after, the sound of police sirens echoed through the air at the entrance of Sunnyvale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the sound, Christopher's eyes lit up, and he quickly ordered the door to be opened to welcome the SWAT team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moments later, several SWAT vehicles pulled up to the Dowson house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sight immediately drew the attention of the neighbors, who gathered to watch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one expected Simon's 70th birthday celebration to turn into something like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A team of SWAT officers, armed with submachine guns, swiftly disembarked from the vehicles and formed a tight unit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon after, Captain Miles and Deputy Captain Riley Rhodes stepped into the courtyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tristan immediately went up to greet them. "Captain Rhodes, is this the famous Captain Miles Donovan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Riley smiled and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew Tristan's father and had a bit of a relationship with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since he happened to be nearby on a mission, he talked to Miles about it and came along to help Tristan out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Miles and Riley were superior and subordinate, they were old comrades, so Miles naturally agreed to come along with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Captain Donovan, it's an honor! I heard you recently completed a major mission in Solomia, capturing the head of the Black Hawk Legion. That's the top international mercenary group. You're amazing!" Tristan said with a smile, his voice laced with flattery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew that getting to know someone like Miles could only benefit him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the leader of the SWAT team, Miles had more power than Riley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tristan, right? I've heard about you from Rhodes. You're as impressive as he says."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Miles shook Tristan's hand politely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Tristan's eyes, shaking hands with someone like Miles was an opportunity he could brag about for years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By the way, Tristan, didn't you say there was a thug here? Where is he? We'll finish up our mission and, since we're already here, we might as well take him in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Riley suddenly remembered the reason they were there and turned to Tristan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this, Tracy, Lucas, and Simon couldn't help but smirk, their gazes full of mockery as they looked at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tristan pointed at Marcus. "That's him. He beat up Christopher and then had the nerve to wait here for you guys. He's basically daring you to do something. Captain Donovan, Captain Rhodes, you can't let him get away with this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Tristan finished speaking, Riley's eyes immediately locked on Marcus. He waved his hand at the SWAT officers outside. "Take this thug down! Bring him back for interrogation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The SWAT officers immediately complied and began surrounding Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane's face paled, and she rushed to stand next to Marcus, trying to protect him from the approaching officers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hold on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before the SWAT officers could move, Miles' voice rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Captain Donovan, is there a problem?" Riley asked, surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, Captain Donovan, hurry up and grab this guy. Don't let him get away!" Tristan urged, his impatience evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Miles shot both of them a harsh glare and shouted, "Who the hell do you think you're arresting? Are you out of your minds?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before anyone could react, Miles jogged over to Marcus, and to everyone's shock, he gave Marcus a crisp salute right in front of everyone.</span></p></div>
