  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though Tony's subordinates couldn't understand why he made such a decision, they had no choice but to nod in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next moment, Tony turned back to Marcus, his demeanor once again filled with respect. "Sir, I've done exactly as you instructed. If you have any further orders, just say the word. I will carry them out without hesitation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tony, in his domineering ways, ruled the slum like an emperor that no one dared to challenge, but he was no fool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Having seen the world, he knew the strength of a warrior. It wasn't something mere mortals like him could contend with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just now, Marcus had killed one of his men with a simple gesture. That alone proved Marcus was an incredibly powerful warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though Tony didn't fully understand the levels of warriors, he instantly realized that this young man was someone he couldn't afford to offend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even with guns, Tony and his men wouldn't stand a chance against Marcus. A single attack from Marcus could easily take their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What was a bit of protection money compared to his life? Besides, the Black Tiger Gang didn't rely solely on the slum's protection fees. They owned large-scale entertainment venues, nightclubs, private KTV lounges, massage parlors, and casinos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The revenue from those businesses was more than enough to sustain their operations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus glanced at Tony and nodded, pleased with his understanding of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I find out you're still collecting protection fees in the slum, your Black Tiger Gang will cease to exist."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This single sentence sent a shiver down Tony's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tony nodded fervently. "Sir, rest assured. I am a man of my word. I won't go back on my promise!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this scene, the residents and vendors all erupted in silent joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This meant the Black Tiger Gang would no longer harass them, allowing them to finally live peaceful lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I called you here because I need information," Marcus continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's the matter, sir? Just say it. I've been in Solariae's underground scene for over twenty years. There's nothing I don't know!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tony said, patting his chest confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you know about a smuggling port around here? Take me there," Marcus said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tony raised an eyebrow slightly and said, "Solariae is the largest port city in Uswad. There's a lot of smuggling here. What kind are you looking for? Even arms have different levels."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus said, "The highest level, of course."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That won't come cheap. You need to be mentally prepared." Tony cautioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Money is not a problem. Lead the way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Marcus walked over to Theo and Mary and handed them a bank card. "It's not much. Use it for your child's education."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Theo hesitated, trying to refuse, but Marcus shoved the card into his pocket and turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Theo and Mary watched Marcus' retreating figure in stunned silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Never in their wildest dreams had they imagined that an ordinary day would bring them a benefactor who would change their lives forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tony dismissed his gang members and personally drove Marcus along the coastal highway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He respectfully handed Marcus a cigarette and lit it for him. "Mr. Fitzgerald, it's only 8 PM. These smuggling operations usually happen after 2 AM. Let's find a place to have a rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, Tony gave Marcus a suggestive grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Where?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus asked casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tony said, "There's an entertainment club nearby. I can take you there to relax. What kind of women do you want? Maybe someone from Crankhurst? They used to be adult film stars and were very skilled."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His excitement grew as he talked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just stay in the car and keep an eye on the port," Marcus replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tony's face fell, but he nodded in disappointment. He reclined his seat and dozed off to pass the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus, meanwhile, kept watch on the distant port while entering a meditative state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every free moment he had, he dedicated himself to cultivation. This constant practice was the key to his rapid growth in strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before long, it was 1 AM.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the distance, a medium-sized cargo ship slowly emerged on the horizon, making its way toward the port.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tony jolted awake from his nap and immediately turned to Marcus. "Mr. Fitzgerald, this ship is carrying mostly contraband and some firearms, but nothing high-grade. I'd estimate the next ship will have what you're looking for."</span></p><div class="pagination">
