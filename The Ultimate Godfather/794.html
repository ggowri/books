        <h1>Chapter 785 Diana's Shock-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead of flinching or retreating, Marcus stood firm. His body crackled with energy as he quickly gathered his most potent force, and in a flash, he shot a Fist Ray toward Diana's Hand Strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment their attacks collided, a deafening crash rang out, and a wave of destructive energy exploded in all directions. The force was so immense that it felt like the ground itself might crack open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite how much stronger Marcus had become, Diana's strike still pushed him back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He staggered, his chest heaving with the force of the impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But astonishingly, he didn't crumble. He stood his ground, taking the hit without backing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was taken aback, her face shifting to one of genuine shock. "Mr. Fitzgerald," she said, her voice incredulous, "I didn't realize you were this strong. Based on what I just saw, even someone in the early stages of Return Essence wouldn't stand a chance against you. Is this really the 'Hidden State' you're talking about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, Diana finally began to believe Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was sure of one thing: no one at the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Nine could have survived that attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her casual strike could've ended the fight with a single blow. Yet Marcus had withstood it, and that was something entirely different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Hidden State is a realm that lies between the Foundation Establishment Stage and the Return Essence stage. It gives me the foundation to push beyond my limits and the ability to challenge opponents stronger than me," Marcus said, nodding with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes widened in shock. She hadn't expected Marcus' trip to the </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall to bring about such a dramatic change in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did you manage that?" she asked, her curiosity piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus then began to recount his experiences in the </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall area, sharing the challenges he faced and the things he'd discovered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana listened, her face a picture of astonishment. She couldn't help but exclaim, "So, you're telling me that not only did you unlock the Hidden State, but you also gained the ability to traverse the space-time tunnel? Is that right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," Marcus replied with a calm nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's expression shifted to one of admiration. The more she learned about Marcus, the more she realized just how exceptional he truly was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his young age, he was always accomplishing things that left her in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For people from within the Ice Wall, the </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall space-time gate had always been an enigmatic and mysterious region.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most didn't dare venture near it, let alone explore it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus, on his first visit, had come away with such enormous gains. Even with Diana's cultivation, she doubted she could have achieved the same thing at his level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, Marcus updated Diana on the progress of the energy crystal firearms project.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After some intense work over the past few weeks, the modifications were nearly complete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of the 2,500 energy crystal guns, excluding the ones Marcus had already given away, Diana still had 2,000 in her possession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus decided to start by distributing 500 of them to Serpent's Coil, boosting their strength to a whole new level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining 1,500 would be reserved for future expansion, to be handed out once other factions were formed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then called Edgar, instructing him to send someone to Bayside Villa to pick up the guns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up, Marcus drove over to Serpent's Coil to check on the group's recent progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Jalen and the others had become Wizards, Serpent's Coil had firmly established its dominance over the underground world of </span><span>Solomia</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All rival factions now deferred to Serpent's Coil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jalen himself had reached the Level Four Wizard stage, and the most powerful member of the magic squad had attained Level Three Wizard status. The rest of the group hovered at the Level Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edgar, who had been training in Ancient Martial Art, had made impressive progress of his own. He'd reached the Ancient Martial Stage Two and was just one step away from advancing to the Stage Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus also took the opportunity to distribute some of the spoils from recent kills to the members of Serpent's Coil, further solidifying their loyalty and morale.</span></p></div>
