        <h1>Chapter 181 Setting Up a Date</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia told the two college girls, "I'm seeing someone, Melina Thurman. Judy Kingsley, I'm </span><span>gonna</span><span> have to skip the party."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina's eyebrows lifted in clear surprise as she inquired, "You have a crush? How come I've never heard a peep about this from you? Natalia, you're not just making this up, are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy chimed in, "A crush? Please. How does that compare to Mr. Burnett? Natalia, we're practically twenty, so you need to be realistic. The Burnett family in Kingston is </span><span>one of the four big power families in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>. What Mr. Burnett can give you is in a whole other league. Think about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia, her patience wearing thin, argued, "Yeah, the Burnett </span><span>family's</span><span> powerful. But I don't know Harvey, and I don't want to meet him. Is that so hard to understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Natalia's steadfast resolve, Melina couldn't help but roll her eyes dramatically. "Natalia, you've got me dying to know who this guy of yours is. He's got you wrapped so tightly around his finger that you're ready to ditch a meeting with Mr. Burnett. Honestly, you're being totally ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina and Judy were Natalia's closest friends at Kingston University.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were both Kingston natives, from well-to-do families, and they were desperate for their friend Natalia to get into the upper-class social circles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Natalia was about to introduce her crush, a tall, handsome figure appeared in front of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, what are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Natalia laid eyes on Marcus, the shadow that clouded her features vanished in an instant, her face lighting up with a radiant smile that blossomed like a flower in the sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I missed you. Came to see you," Marcus said, a playful grin spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, you're the best!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia immediately looped her arm through his, looking like a happy little bird.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina and Judy exchanged surprised glances. "Natalia, this is the guy you always talk about? Is he the crush you were just mentioning?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy and a few other female classmates perked up their ears curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had heard endless tales of Marcus, but now, standing before him, they found themselves distinctly unimpressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, Marcus was handsome in a boy-next-door kind of way, but it was obvious he wasn't a man of any real status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia leaned her head on Marcus' shoulder with a contented smile on her face, "Bingo. Marcus is my crush. He and my sister divorced a long time ago, but I haven't changed my mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After her declaration, several girls gasped, covering their mouths as their faces morphed into expressions of sheer surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina and Judy scrutinized Marcus with critical eyes, taking in every detail with a mix of curiosity and skepticism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina was the first to speak, extending her hand to Marcus with a polite smile, "I'm Melina Thurman, Natalia's best friend. We've heard so much about you. It's nice to finally meet you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy greeted Marcus briefly, but Marcus could clearly see the hostility and the barely concealed disgust in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As Natalia's best friends, we're dying to know, what do you do for a living? Can you really make Natalia happy in the long run?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if Melina and Judy had rehearsed their interrogation. They launched into a series of questions, firing them at Marcus in rapid succession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since they were Natalia's close friends, Marcus took no offense, responding with an easy smile, "I'm still on the job hunt, but I'm confident I can make Natalia happy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina, Judy, and the other girls couldn't help but snicker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "So, he is an unemployed bum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lack of a job must be why Natalia's sister showed him the door, and now, he shows up here, trying to leech off of Natalia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this thought fueling her, Melina's courage swelled. She threw Marcus a challenging look and questioned him with provocation, "We're introducing Natalia to someone today. You don't have a problem with that, do you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow. He wasn't about to argue with a bunch of spoiled college girls and smiled, "You're doing it for Natalia's own good, right? Of course, I don't object. But as Natalia's elder, I've got every right to keep an eye on things. I want to meet this guy you're bringing into the picture."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Melina and Judy exchanged smirks filled with scorn. "Looks like you've got some sense after all. If you're so keen on supervising, then come along to the party. That way, you'll see firsthand the chasm between you and Mr. Burnett!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Melina, Judy, stop it," Natalia said. "Marcus is busy. He doesn't have time for your party. Besides, I already told you, I don't want to meet Harvey!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her patience frayed at the edges, and her voice now carried a chill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was tired of her friends' condescending attitude and their blatant disrespect towards Marcus.</span></p></div>
