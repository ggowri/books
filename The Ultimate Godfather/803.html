  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The commotion immediately caught the attention of several onlookers, most of whom were there on official business with the OIG.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In such a solemn, high-pressure environment, no one dared to speak loudly, let alone argue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when faced with the arrogant attitudes of staff, most people chose to endure the humiliation in silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Grace fearlessly stood up to </span><span>Arabella Vandenberg</span><span>, a staff member here, the crowd couldn't help but feel a mix of satisfaction and concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, so that's how it is?" Arabella sneered, her tone dripping with sarcasm. "You're just here to cause trouble, aren't you? Fine, if that's what you want, don't blame me for being harsh."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clapped her hands mockingly, as if applauding their audacity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to the nearby security guards, she barked, "Security! Take these two troublemakers out of here. No need to be gentle&mdash;escort them straight to the police station."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards nodded and began moving toward Grace and Marcus, ready to carry out her orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp, authoritative voice cut through the tension, drawing everyone's attention to the entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Heads turned to see a group of middle-aged men in formal jackets walking toward the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leading them was none other than Pablo Ashford, the Director of the OIG.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind him were other high-ranking officials, their presence instantly commanding respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd parted instinctively, making way for the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arabella's haughty demeanor vanished in an instant, replaced by a look of deference. "Mr. Ashford, these two have been causing a scene, demanding to see you. I was about to have security remove them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pablo's brow furrowed as he scanned Grace and Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze lingered on Grace for a moment before he spoke, "You're Benjamin Mitchell's daughter, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes narrowed slightly, and a faint, mocking smirk tugged at the corners of his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I am," Grace said firmly. "And I'd like to know why you've arrested my father. The charges you've brought against him don't add up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pablo adjusted his tie, his tone calm but laced with superiority. "The charges against your father were based on a thorough investigation by our special task force. Do you honestly think I, as the director of OIG, would fabricate something like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pablo's history with Ryder ran deep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryder had saved his life once, and ever since, Pablo had treated Ryder with unwavering respect, almost like a blood relative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin, however, had been the one to send Ryder to prison, condemning him to a life sentence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That act had festered into a deep resentment within Pablo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had even approached his father, Julian, asking him to use his influence to secure Ryder's release.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Julian, ever the principled man, had flatly refused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian, a former soldier and an incorruptible leader, valued integrity above all else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Ryder was his son-in-law, he refused to bend the rules for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pablo, unable to accept this outcome, decided to take matters into his own hands. Fueled by a desire for revenge, he fabricated evidence of bribery, embezzlement, and other crimes to frame Benjamin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pablo's goal was simple&mdash;to make Benjamin suffer the same fate as Ryder&mdash;spending the rest of his life behind bars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then would Pablo feel as though he had avenged Ryder and balanced the scales.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least Pablo had found a way to avenge Ryder.</span></p><div class="pagination">
