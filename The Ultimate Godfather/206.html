        <h1>Chapter 205 He's Not the Best Choice Yet</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Maxine's eyes, Marcus had become something of a legend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had managed to guide Robert through Edward's surgery, a feat that could only be described as miraculous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine never imagined that Marcus, with such ease, could provide a pill capable of curing her grandfather's long-standing illness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaun's expression darkened. He hadn't expected Marcus to possess such abilities either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew, still looking in awe at Marcus, began to walk toward him. Owen rushed forward to assist, but Matthew gently pushed him aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each step Matthew took, he moved with surprising steadiness, radiating an air of calm and composure. He no longer looked like an elderly man whose life was nearing its end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This pill... it's truly miraculous. Not only has it saved my life, but it's also given me back my vitality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This tiny pill surpasses any gift I could have ever received. Thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To everyone's astonishment, this respected elder, known throughout </span><span>Uswad</span><span>, bowed deeply to Marcus in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus immediately helped Matthew back up. "It was nothing, Sir Burnett. Please, no need to be so formal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew grasped Marcus' </span><span>hand,</span><span> his weathered eyes filled with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As someone who had been condemned to die by everyone, suddenly being given a second chance at life, this feeling was something only Matthew truly understood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt calling Marcus his savior didn't even begin to cover it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice trembling with emotion, Matthew said, "Young man, although your family background may not be as illustrious as Shaun's, I believe you are far more suited to be Maxine's partner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I'm old now. I won't involve myself in the matters of the younger generation. As for who gets to marry Maxine, it will be up to you both. I will no longer interfere."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew's words were clear and to the point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, Marcus had saved his life, and he could no longer stand in the way of Marcus and Maxine's relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as the respected patriarch of the Burnett family, Matthew had long supported Shaun and had even accepted Shaun's generous gifts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't simply turn around and offer his support to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Matthew chose to remain neutral. Whichever of the two men ended up marrying Maxine would have to rely on their own merits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded understandingly, fully aware of the delicate situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although he saved Sir Burnett and has earned the title of a miracle worker, what else does he have to offer? Compared to Mr. Whitman, he doesn't stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the Burnett family were to marry into the Whitman family, it would place us at the forefront of not just </span><span>Uswad</span><span> but globally. That's the real benefit to our family. So, in my opinion, Maxine still cannot marry this man. Mr. Whitman is the right choice for her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the situation seemed to lean more and more in Marcus' favor, Ruth quickly stepped in to voice her opinion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her words, the members of the Burnett family fell silent, contemplating what had just been said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moment later, a few of them began to openly support Ruth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, as the leading family in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>, every decision had to be considered from every angle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus might have saved Matthew's life, and the Burnett family could repay him for that. But allowing Maxine to marry him was out of the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wouldn't benefit the family, and it would be impossible to justify such a marriage to the Whitman family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Burnett family would be left with a tarnished reputation in the eyes of the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ruth is right. Even though he saved my father's life, when it comes to family status, he's not a match for our Burnett family!" Malcolm chimed in, adding his voice to the chorus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Owen, Hazel, and Stella were aware of Malcolm and Ruth's ulterior motives, they still couldn't bring themselves to let their daughter marry a man who was nothing more than a skilled doctor with no noble background.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sync Group's here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rising Group's here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pioneer Group's here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Eastcomm</span><span> Group's here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, four powerful voices echoed from the direction of the entrance to the banquet hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone turned their eyes toward the doors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Four teams entered in perfect unison, marching into the Burnett Villa's grand hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of the groups brought lavish gifts, and their presents rivaled even Shaun's extravagant offering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sync Group, Rising Group, Pioneer Group, </span><span>Eastcomm</span><span> Group, these four companies were once the backbone of the Brown family in Kingston."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Recently, a man named 'Death' acquired them for a staggering 350 billion dollars and has since overseen their operations. In just over a month, the value of these four companies has skyrocketed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Together, their combined worth has reached 800 billion dollars, making them an undeniable force in Kingston. To think that these four companies would come together like this it's truly unexpected!"</span></p></div>
