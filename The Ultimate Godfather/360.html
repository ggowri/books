  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Grace looked radiant, her complexion glowing with health&mdash;a stark contrast to her previous pallor and frailty. She now appeared as vibrant and healthy as she once had been, exuding a fresh and captivating charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus almost did not recognize her at first glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, thank you for saving my life!" Grace bowed deeply, her delicate face filled with heartfelt gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For years, she had endured relentless suffering from her illness, burdening Benjamin and Lilian with worry and living in the shadow of despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace had resigned herself to the belief that her life was nearing its end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, at her darkest hour, Marcus had appeared, using his extraordinary skills to cure her leukemia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Grace, it felt like a rebirth, a miracle beyond words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus helped Grace up, smiling modestly. "It was nothing, Ms. Mitchell. No need to thank me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mayor Benjamin, do you have guests?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A voice interrupted them, speaking Uswadic with a noticeable foreign accent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The awkward pronunciation immediately suggested the speaker was not Uswadian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Griffin, let me introduce you. This is Mr. Fitzgerald, my daughter Grace's savior and one of Solomia's most outstanding young talents."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Four figures entered the room&mdash;three men and one woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them were two middle-aged men in their fifties, a young man in his twenties, and a teenage girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin eagerly introduced Marcus to the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four visitors scrutinized Marcus with polite yet reserved expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, it is a pleasure to meet you. I am Terry Griffin," Terry said, stepping forward to shake hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gestured toward the others. "This is my younger brother, Zane Griffin, my son, Easton Griffin, and my daughter, Charlotte Griffin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus exchanged greetings with them, though he could not shake a lingering discomfort. Historical grievances had left him with a deep-seated aversion to people from Crankhurst.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the introductions, Terry's gaze lingered on Grace with a predatory intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he tried to conceal it, Marcus' sharp eyes caught the fleeting expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Lilian had prepared a table full of traditional Uswadian dishes, each one beautifully presented and bursting with flavor. The spread rivaled any five-star restaurant, yet carried the warmth of a home-cooked meal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Griffin, since this is your first visit to Uswad, please enjoy some of our cuisine and compare it to Crankhurst's," Benjamin said, gesturing for Terry to begin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terry smiled, "Uswadic culture is vast and profound. I have always admired it from afar. Seeing it firsthand, especially through its cuisine, I can tell it is incredibly diverse."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zane sampled a dish, his expression turning peculiar. "Uswadic food is flavorful, but I find it masks the natural taste of the ingredients. Compared to Crankhurst's culinary traditions, it is somewhat lacking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have also noticed that much of Uswadic culture seems borrowed from Crankhurst. For a country with a supposed 5,000-year history, it is disappointing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have been meaning to say the same thing," Charlotte chimed in. "From what I have studied, during the wars decades ago, Uswad was defeated by Crankhurst. Even now, in terms of culture, economy, history, and medicine, Uswad lags far behind us. I do not understand why my dad insists on doing business with such a country."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlotte's words were laced with condescension, and she delivered them in halting Uswadic, making no secret of her disdain for Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, the things she and Zane said were completely turning the truth upside down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her blatant insults and revisionist remarks darkened the expressions of Benjamin and Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "Earlier, the Crankhurstians had seemed courteous and respectful. But now that the business deal is sealed, their true arrogance is on full display."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mayor Benjamin mentioned that this man saved Ms. Mitchell from leukemia. In an advanced country like Crankhurst, even we struggle to treat such diseases.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Given Uswad's outdated medical system, it is highly likely she was misdiagnosed. Your doctor probably mistook a minor blood condition for leukemia. Otherwise, how could someone so young and inexperienced cure such a serious illness?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlotte's voice dripped with scorn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though she looked no older than eighteen or nineteen, her arrogance was palpable, as if Crankhurst were the pinnacle of civilization in her mind.</span></p><div class="pagination">
