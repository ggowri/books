If you try to fight back, you'll only end up dead, and you'll provoke the hijackers. Do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clutched his arm tightly, preventing him from rising.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the hijackers went down the line, demanding passengers hand over their valuables and bank card passwords.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few passengers who resisted were shot in the head on the spot, sending waves of fear and bloodshed through the cabin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, a hijacker approached Marcus and the long-haired girl, saying, "Hand over your valuables now. Write down your bank password. If it's wrong, I'll shoot you without hesitation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's eyes flashed with determination; he wanted to confront the hijacker, but the girl pulled him back down and shook her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking the lead, she surrendered her valuables and began to write down her bank password.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hijacker smirked, clearly pleased with her compliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he was distracted checking her belongings, the girl seized the opportunity, grabbing his wrist and snatching the gun from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She aimed the weapon at his temple, declaring to the other hijackers, "Drop your guns, or I'll kill him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sequence of events was swift, almost a blur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl moved with incredible precision and speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being an experienced criminal, the hijacker was caught off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining hijackers looked on with grim expressions, their eyes filled with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them sneered, "You really think you can turn this around by yourself? Not gonna happen!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No sooner had he spoken than several hijackers disregarded their companion's safety and opened fire on the girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she hadn't reacted in time, she would have been shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hijackers were quick and ruthless, using the cover of their two armed comrades to close in on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were not only skilled marksmen but also had impressive hand-to-hand combat abilities, attacking with a ferocity that left little room for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Together, they quickly overpowered her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One hijacker held her down, sneering, "How dare you fight back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze roamed over her figure, a predatory glint in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, she's a cop!" another hijacker exclaimed, pulling an ID card from her backpack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her name was Maxine Burnett, from Solomia Special Police Academy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus recognized the academy, located not far from Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the largest police training institution in the eastern region of Uswad, producing thousands of exceptional special police officers every year, many of whom went on to become key figures in law enforcement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was astonished to learn that this long-haired girl was a student there. No wonder she had stepped up in such a crisis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hijacker holding Maxine laughed lewdly, "A cop, huh? She's pretty cute too. We'll have some fun with her later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the gun pointed at her head, Maxine's delicate features remained resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seizing a moment of distraction, she swiftly kicked the hijacker in the groin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He doubled over in pain, and she attempted to reclaim the gun, but another hijacker stomped down on her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop it. You're outmatched," he warned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With steely resolve, Maxine replied, "I'm a student at Solomia Special Police Academy. It's my duty to protect lives and property. Even if I die, I won't let you win."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring the pain from her pinned arm, she managed to pull herself free and threw a punch at her captor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He caught her wrist and hurled her to the floor before grasping her by the neck, lifting her from the floor. "You really want to make this worse? Guys, let's teach her a real lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lustful smiles spread across the faces of the other hijackers as they approached Maxine, ready to assault her sexually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stubbornness and despair flickered in her eyes, mixed with a sense of failure for not being able to protect the passengers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several hijackers approached Maxine while unbuckling their belts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before they could get close to her, Marcus shouted, "Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hijackers turned, frowning. One asked, "What do you want? Don't spoil our fun!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus replied, "Let her go. You want fun? I'll give you."</span></p><div class="pagination">
