        <h1>Chapter 79 The Treatment</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus offered an awkward smile. "Menstrual cramps stem from the uterus, and most of the time, they're caused by excessive cold in that area. The uterus is located in the lower abdomen, but your trousers are in the way, making it hard for me to proceed. Please, don't misunderstand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie paused, realizing his explanation made sense, and reluctantly let go of his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gently tugged at the waistband of Josie's trousers, lowering them slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie wished the floor would open up and swallow her whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since her husband's passing, she hadn't been this physically close to another man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus adjusted the waistband to rest just above her hips, revealing glimpses of her black lace underwear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dark fabric accentuated the natural contours, which made Josie flush crimson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, can we proceed now?" she asked, trying to maintain a semblance of composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded. "We can. Please lie back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie reclined on the couch, her posture stiff, humiliation written all over her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus placed his warm palm on her lower abdomen. Josie instinctively shuddered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been years since anyone touched her like this, and the sensation was strangely unfamiliar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus infused his Numinous Energy, Josie felt a wave of warmth spreading through her abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp, piercing pain eased almost instantly, replaced by a comforting glow that seemed to radiate throughout her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warmth was soothing, like sunlight on a cold day, and Josie found herself closing her eyes, savoring the sensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her lips parted slightly, and as Marcus's hand moved in slow, rhythmic circles, she let out a soft, involuntary moan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mmm... that feels so good..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words escaped her before she realized it, and she immediately blushed deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the Numinous Energy worked to dissolve the cold inside her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the process intensified, Josie felt a rush of euphoria, unlike anything she'd experienced before. Her back arched instinctively, and she let out an audible cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahhh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mind went blank, and she couldn't help but associate the overwhelming sensation with something intimate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intense stimulation she had just experienced bore an uncanny resemblance to that intimacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say it surpassed it by several magnitudes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie even found herself thinking that this indescribable pleasure was entirely unprecedented&mdash;something she had never felt, not even with her late husband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intensity of the experience was overwhelming, leaving Josie utterly lost in it. Her body moved of its own accord, responding to the intoxicating sensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the euphoria reached its peak, Marcus suddenly withdrew his energy, ending the treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bliss vanished abruptly, and Josie's body stilled. A sense of disappointment welled up inside her. She couldn't stop herself from asking, "Mr. Fitzgerald, why did you stop?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus explained patiently. "Your body contains an excess of cold energy, which can't be eliminated in one session. Prolonged treatment could harm your internal organs. For now, easing the pain is enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright..." Josie nodded, though she couldn't shake the lingering feeling of loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Embarrassed by her earlier reaction, she quickly adjusted her clothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does it still hurt?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie fastened her trousers and replied, "Not at all. Mr. Fitzgerald, your hands truly work miracles."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hesitated before asking with anticipation, "When can we have the next treatment?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at her thoughtfully. "The best time would be right after your cycle ends."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie committed the timing to memory and added eagerly, "My cycles are very short&mdash;three to four days at most. Would it be possible to schedule the next session then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled. "That should work fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Satisfied with the response, Josie finally felt at ease, her anticipation building for the next treatment three days later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The irresistible, cloud-like sensation lingered in her memory, replaying vividly in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I'll take my leave now. See you at the office first thing tomorrow morning," Josie said with a charming smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded and escorted her to the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Closing the door behind him, he murmured to himself, "Who would've thought that a mother like her look this stunning?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie's elegance and charm rivaled any unmarried woman's, and her maturity added an irresistible allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Jane exuded a sultry and flirtatious charm, Josie was poised and graceful, embodying the image of a sophisticated businesswoman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each had their unique qualities, but Marcus couldn't deny that Josie held a stronger pull over him.</span></p></div>
