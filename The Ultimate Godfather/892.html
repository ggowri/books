  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who were those people? Should we ask </span><span>Solomia</span><span> Police Academy for backup?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine asked with genuine concern, hoping to leverage the academy's resources to help </span><span>Marcus</span><span> deal with the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled and said, "The </span><span>Solomia</span><span> Police Academy can't handle these guys but don't worry, I've already scared them off, and they won't dare bother me again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine nodded her head in relief after hearing Marcus' reassurance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, Maxine had gotten fully dressed and wiped down the damp car seat until it was clean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus caught a whiff of an intoxicating fragrance as he stepped into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Maxine had deliberately sprayed her perfume in the car to mask the lingering scent of their intimate encounter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you sniffing at?" Maxine awkwardly asked as she watched Marcus take in the scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm trying to catch the scent of our previous activities, but it has disappeared. What a shame," Marcus said casually, speaking about their intimate moment as if it were the most natural thing in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's pretty face turned bright red as she angrily glared at Marcus and said, "How can you be so shameless? What's so good about that smell?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It smells wonderful. I love it. I wonder when I'll get to smell it again," Marcus said, looking Maxine up and down suggestively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though it seemed like a simple compliment, his words carried an underlying tone of probing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine didn't read too deeply into it, shooting Marcus a glare as she responded, "I'm all yours now, aren't I? You can have me whenever you want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words tumbled out before she could stop them, and she immediately regretted her candid response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It dawned on her that Marcus had deliberately led her to that admission, prompting Maxine to kick her fist and punch his chest in frustration. Hissing through gritted teeth, she said, "You sneaky bastard! I can't believe you tricked me like that. I'm done </span><span>with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus pulled her into his arms in one swift motion, saying, "You just said you're mine, so how can you be done with me? And don't forget! You promised I could have you whenever I want. I'm holding you to that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's face burned even brighter at his words, and she wished the ground would open up and swallow her whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had blurted out those words without thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just one statement like that had implicitly revealed her willingness to have another encounter with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was essentially saying she was available anytime he wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, her heart and body had wholly surrendered to Marcus' charms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her feelings, she was still a young woman, and being so forward about such matters felt incredibly improper to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You big troublemaker, we shouldn't meet up too often after this time, especially since you mentioned how busy you are," Maxine said, her voice tinged with unmistakable jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you worried I might go on dates with other girls?" Marcus asked tentatively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's beautiful eyes widened instantly, flashing with a dangerous glint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fierce look in her eyes quickly faded away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that Marcus had other women in his life, which was an unchangeable fact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Maxine chose to be with Marcus, she had already prepared to accept this reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before meeting Marcus, she had always believed that love should be exclusive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But things were different now, as she had lost her heart to this incredibly passionate man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would have to share his love with other women in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought left a bitter taste in her mouth, but she felt powerless to change it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was simply the reality of her situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of answering Marcus' question, she settled back into the passenger seat, resting her chin on her hand while gazing at the turbulent waves on the distant horizon.</span></p><div class="pagination">
