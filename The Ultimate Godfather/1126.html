  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you afraid I'll get hurt? He's just a young man in his early twenties. How could he possibly hurt me? Are you joking with me?" Minerva said disdainfully.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She let out a cold laugh, her eyes filled with sarcasm, then said to Marcus, "Trespassing into Emotionless Gorge is a capital offense. You also deceived Gertie, causing her to lose her chastity. These two crimes alone are enough for me to kill you. But I disdain to lay a hand on you&mdash;take your own life."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Minerva acting like a mad dog, Marcus sneered. "Hold on, don't say all that yet. I have a question for you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Minerva asked, "What question?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus asked, "Is it because you're getting older, so you've hit menopause?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Minerva's face turned bright red upon hearing this, and a trace of icy killing intent flashed in her eyes. "What are you talking about? It seems you really have a death wish."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Minerva's energy erupted completely. A supreme destructive force surrounded her, making the entire space incredibly oppressive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Minerva's cultivation was only at the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Nine, she possessed the ability to challenge higher levels.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus estimated that Minerva should be able to contend with someone who had just reached the Return Essence stage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Minerva, don't act impulsively. Stop it!" Seeing Minerva about to attack Marcus, Gertie hurriedly stepped forward to stop her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Gertie, didn't you hear what he said to me? I must kill him with my own hands today," Minerva said coldly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Minerva, please don't act impulsively. You're no match for him," Gertie finally admitted the truth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew Minerva was a very prideful person, especially when facing men.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Minerva was told she was no match for Marcus, she would be furious. But Gertie had no choice but to tell the truth to prevent Minerva from getting hurt.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Minerva said helplessly, "Gertie, what are you talking about? He's just a young man. How could I not be his match?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You don't need to lie to me anymore. I know you're saying this to protect him. But it's useless. He's already crossed my line, so no matter what you say, he must die today."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Gertie expected, Minerva didn&rsquo;t believe her at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, energy burst out from Minerva, streams of destructive force gathering in her palm. She then swiftly struck a destructive handprint toward Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Its power was incredibly terrifying. In a short time, the void trembled wherever the Hand Strike passed. It was clear that Minerva wanted to kill Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Marcus remained calm, quietly watching Minerva's Hand Strike, without even attempting to dodge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You&rsquo;re not dodging at all. Looks like you&rsquo;re truly scared stiff. But, you do have some self-awareness, because even if you tried to dodge, I&rsquo;d still kill you in the end." Minerva sneered as she saw Marcus remain still.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, she infused an even stronger destructive force into her Hand Strike, attempting to kill Marcus with a single attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a boom, Minerva's Hand Strike slammed into Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, despite the immense power of her Hand Strike, it didn&rsquo;t affect Marcus&rsquo;s body at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus remained calmly standing in place. If you looked closely, you&rsquo;d notice a faint, almost imperceptible film covering the surface of his body. It was this film that blocked Minerva&rsquo;s attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Minerva widened her eyes, a hint of surprise in her gaze toward Marcus, then couldn&rsquo;t help but say, &ldquo;How is this possible? How can you ignore my attack? Tell me, what treasure do you have on you?&rdquo;</span></p><div class="pagination">
