  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought sent a cold chill down her spine. Her gaze darted nervously to Marcus, hoping against hope he wouldn't target her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as time passed, she realized how misplaced her fears were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't even glance in her direction. It was as though she didn't exist in his world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His indifference hit harder than any confrontation ever could, leaving her questioning her significance for the first time in years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was she worth nothing to him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of Julian's aides promptly stepped forward, efficiently formalizing Marcus' appointment as Special Military Advisor and granting him the rank of Major Commander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed and precision with which Julian's team worked were astonishing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tasks that usually involved layers of bureaucracy were handled with remarkable ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This left Marcus with little doubt&mdash;Julian had come prepared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was obvious the old Commander had set his sights on recruiting Marcus well before arriving today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And just as Marcus suspected, Julian had indeed planned every detail meticulously to bring him on board.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was where all the preparation came from.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, Commander Ashford, when will Benjamin Mitchell be released?" Marcus asked, his voice calm but edged with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the issue that weighed on his mind the most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as Benjamin was locked up, Grace would continue to worry herself sick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian chuckled, a glint of reassurance in his eyes. "Don't worry, Marcus. As long as I'm around, everything's in good hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You see, since Benjamin's a city official, there are a few formalities to take care of when it comes to his release. It'll take no more than three days. I'll personally arrange a plane to get him back to </span><span>Solomia</span><span> and reinstate him as mayor. How does that sound?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian </span><span>smiled,</span><span> his tone full of confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus still looked uneasy, his brow furrowing slightly. "You really think it'll be done in three days?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian gave a hearty laugh. "I can guarantee it. I might be getting up there in years, but I'm still good for this. Trust me, Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And don't worry about Benjamin. For the next three days, he won't be suffering. He'll have the same conditions as on the outside&mdash;just no freedom for a while."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Julian's assurance, Marcus finally relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace nodded in agreement, feeling a weight lift off her shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as her father was safe, a few extra days didn't matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that Benjamin would regain his position was an unexpected but welcome surprise for Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the promise made, Marcus and Grace exited the OIG's building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I can't thank you enough! Without you, my dad would never have been out this quickly. He might have spent his whole life behind bars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment they stepped outside, Grace's face lit up, her voice filled with genuine admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes sparkled with gratitude, unable to hide her awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before this, they had been facing off against Julian Ashford's son, Pablo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Marcus' assurances, Grace had remained skeptical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, seeing the way Julian Ashford treated Marcus, Grace realized how wrong she'd been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One phone call from Marcus, and Julian had removed his own son from his position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he appointed Marcus as a Special Military Advisor for </span><span>Uswad</span><span> and even granted him the rank of Major Commander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It all felt like something out of a dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't tell if she was awake or not.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're my woman. Helping you get your father back was the least I could do. No need to be so formal with me anymore," Marcus said with a teasing smile, his eyes tracing the soft, innocent lines of Grace's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than that, he had noticed her progress&mdash;she had advanced to the Ancient Martial Stage Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just over a month, she had made a huge leap from the first level to the second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus hadn't helped her directly at all during this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was all her own hard work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While her progress wasn't on his level, it was still impressive enough to put most in the Ancient Martial Art world to shame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace's cheeks flushed with embarrassment, a shy smile tugging at the corner of her lips. "Mr. Fitzgerald, do you really see me as your woman?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
