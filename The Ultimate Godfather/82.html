        <h1>Chapter 81 Place an Order</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young secretary stopped a chubby, balding man outside the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This man was Walter Wollaston, the Deputy general manager of AquaVital Pharmaceuticals in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>AquaVital Pharmaceuticals, based in Kingston, was part of the influential Wollaston family and ranked among the top three pharmaceutical companies in the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a true industry leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Backed by the influential Brown family, AquaVital Pharmaceuticals had seen its profits soar in recent years, its sales skyrocketing as it aggressively expanded its operations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The company had recently acquired land near Kingston's border to construct its third regional branch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of so-called 'distinguished guest' could possibly be more important than AquaVital Pharmaceuticals?" Walter sneered arrogantly. "Do you know that a single order from us could keep BioFusion Pharmaceuticals busy for half a year?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The secretary flustered, tried to explain. "The guest arrived earlier, and according to protocol, Ms. Shelman must attend to them first. Please wait patiently, Mr. Wollaston."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter, clearly having lost his temper, slapped the secretary across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cheek flushed red, swelling almost instantly, as tears welled up in her eyes. "Mr. Wollaston, why did you hit me?" she cried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why?" Walter growled, his voice full of disdain. "Because you're in my way! Your boss has no respect for AquaVital. The last time I came, she was busy with another client. Now, again, she's making me wait! This is nothing short of deliberate disrespect!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished, Walter shoved the secretary aside and stormed towards Josie's office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, Josie, hearing the commotion in the hallway, furrowed her brow. Turning to Marcus, she said, "Mr. Fitzgerald, let me handle this situation. Please wait a moment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not wanting to disturb Marcus, Josie left to intercept Walter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, Ms. Shelman, you certainly make it difficult for someone like me to see you," Walter sneered as she appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes roved over her with undisguised greed, lingering on her poised figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As one of the most prominent young businesswomen in Kingston, Josie was often the target of unwanted attention, and Walter had long harbored less-than-professional intentions towards her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling disgusted by his lecherous gaze, Josie maintained a polite but distant smile. "Mr. Wollaston, I was in the middle of assisting a client. If there's been any oversight, I hope you can understand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? And what kind of client could possibly rival AquaVital Pharmaceuticals?" Walter retorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He moved as if to barge into Josie's office, but she quickly stepped in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We at BioFusion Pharmaceuticals prioritize client confidentiality," she said firmly. "Please respect that, Mr. Wollaston."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Walter only scoffed, shoving past her to push the door open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, seeing a young man seated calmly, Walter's face twisted with contempt. "This is the 'distinguished guest' you mentioned? This kid?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie replied calmly, "This is Marcus Fitzgerald, a senior executive from Golden Group in Solomia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter's eyes narrowed with a mix of disdain and calculation. "Golden Group may be somewhat notable in Solomia, but in Kingston, they're nothing. And he's just an executive? How could he possibly compare to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie's dislike for Walter deepened. Not only was the man arrogant and unreasonable, but his lack of professionalism was appalling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie couldn't understand why AquaVital Pharmaceuticals would hire someone like Walter. "Mr. Wollaston," she said coldly, "at BioFusion Pharmaceuticals, we treat all clients equally. I hope you can understand that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Equal treatment?" Walter laughed derisively. "Ms. Shelman, let's not pretend. AquaVital Pharmaceuticals is in urgent need of expansion. I'm here to place an order for ten top-of-the-line production lines. I expect them delivered in one month!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie frowned slightly. "Mr. Wollaston, I've just signed a contract with Mr. Fitzgerald for ten production lines as well. Our workers are already working overtime to meet the three-month timeline we agreed upon. Your order will have to wait."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter's face darkened. "With the business AquaVital brings you, shouldn't we be prioritized? I suggest you delay other orders and focus on ours first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie shook her head firmly. "That's not possible. Business must be conducted on a first-come, first-served basis. I signed Mr. Fitzgerald's contract first, and I will honor it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter scowled. "So, you're saying you're not giving us any special consideration?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm afraid not," Josie replied apologetically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning his glare to Marcus, Walter sneered. "Listen, kid. Push your order back and let ours take priority. Do that, and I'll make it worth your while."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow, feigning interest. "And how much are you offering?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter, thinking he'd found a weak spot, smirked. "Ten million. How's that? A company exec like you probably earns two or three million a year. Ten million is more than enough for you to live comfortably for years. Any smart man would take it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter was not only the vice president of AquaVital Pharmaceuticals, but his mother's maiden name was Brown, making her a distant relative of the prominent Brown family from Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Additionally, Walter held shares in AquaVital Pharmaceuticals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his influence, he could easily allocate ten million to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Walter's eyes, Marcus would surely be tempted by the offer of such money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie glanced at Marcus, her heart sinking slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could he really be tempted by money?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If so, why had he refused the previous offer of 2.5 million?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too little," Marcus said flatly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter's eyes gleamed. "Name your price. Twenty million, then. But I won't go any higher. Opportunities like this don't come twice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus smiled faintly and held up five fingers.</span></p></div>
