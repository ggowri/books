  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That brought Gertie an unprecedented sense of pleasure, as if she was flying in the clouds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That blissful and stimulating feeling made her want more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she knew that Yasser was outside, she couldn't care less.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That feeling was so wonderful that Gertie finally understood why her cousin, even though having been raped by Marcus, was still willing to be his woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie even wondered if it was only Marcus who was so potent in bed, or if all men were like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it that as long as a woman had slept with a man, she would experience such intense pleasure?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking for a while, Gertie dismissed the latter thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If all men were so potent, why would there still be unfaithful women in the world?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every woman might be faithful to her husband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if their husband had great shortcomings in some aspects, they would still love him wholeheartedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the magic of sex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost at the same time, under Marcus' crazy sprint, his body twitched, and he finally felt released and ejaculated his seeds into Gertie's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie experienced an unprecedented sense of fulfillment. When Marcus was released, she had already come the sixth time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was panting heavily; his skin was flushed and covered in sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie's body leaned weakly against the cliff as she let out soft gasps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She seemed completely exhausted and had no strength left at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Greetings, Sir. I'm Yasser Tucker. May I ask if my fianc&eacute;e Gertie is in your illusion rune? If she is, please tell her that I'm waiting for her outside. Please take your time passing on your skills and teachings to her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Yasser's voice faintly reached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this voice, Gertie immediately woke up from her limp state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly took out some clean clothes from her Spatial Ring and put them on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than five minutes, she applied some makeup and tidied up her disheveled hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you going out to see him?" Marcus asked Gertie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie's body shivered, and she couldn't help but turn to Marcus and ask, "Is that okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was clearly seeking permission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason was simple. She was currently in the illusion rune set up by Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given that her strength was inferior to Marcus', if he didn't want her to leave, she wouldn't be able to get out of this illusion rune for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, it's okay, as long as you're not afraid of him finding out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie gave Marcus a fierce glare, and a trace of resentment flashed in her beautiful eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most precious thing of hers had been taken away by this guy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it happened when her fianc&eacute; was present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That fact made Gertie hate Marcus deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please open the illusion rune for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Gertie needed help from Marcus, so she couldn't afford to have a fallout with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus also found a set of clean clothes and changed into them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, with a wave of his hand, the light of the rune flashed in his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie immediately felt that the scene in front of her became illusory for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, it completely disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were back in the mountaintop area by the seaside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She immediately saw Yasser, who was waiting there, as well as Devon and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Yasser saw Gertie appear, a trace of surprise immediately crossed his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He approached Gertie quickly and said, "Gertie, you're finally out. Are you still mad at me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I came here to apologize to you. If you can forgive me, I'll do anything you ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The reason I did such a foolish thing that day was that I loved you too much. From now on, I definitely won't make similar mistakes again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser's sincerity made Gertie's heart ache even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She forced a smile at Yasser and said, "I'm not mad at you. I just came out to visit my cousin. You don't have to be like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser didn't suspect anything, nor did he expect that Gertie had already been taken advantage of by Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he heard Gertie say that, he thought she was still mad at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So he apologized even more sincerely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie became even more embarrassed. She wanted to say that it was she who should be apologizing, not Yasser.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the words that came to her lips were swallowed back down.</span></p><div class="pagination">
