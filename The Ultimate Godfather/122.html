  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leia noticed the marks on Josie's neck and kept asking questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was then that Josie realized her skin was covered with the marks Marcus had left during their wild night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It wasn't Marcus bullying me. I wasn't feeling well, so he was helping treat me," Josie said, coming up with another little white lie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie once again told a harmless lie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as she said it, she regretted it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could feel Marcus's peculiar gaze on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Marcus could barely hold back his laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Treating her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This woman really knew how to make up stories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then again, it did feel like he was treating her last night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Treating her loneliness!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After breakfast, Marcus and Josie took Leia to preschool together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps afraid of being seen, Josie covered herself up tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of the other mothers at the preschool looked concerned, assuming Josie was sick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Embarrassed, Josie wished she could disappear into a hole, all while glaring furiously at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, it's all your fault. Why were you so wild last night? How am I supposed to show my face now?" she complained as they got into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Josie's tone was full of complaints, her voice carried an unmistakable happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The unforgettable memories of last night replayed in Josie's mind, leaving her longing for more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were even crazier than me! Look at my body&mdash;it's no better than yours. And isn't this exactly what you wanted? You kept begging me to go faster and not stop!" Marcus teased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie quickly covered his mouth. "Stop talking! Don't you have any shame?" she exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's there to be embarrassed about? We've already done everything that can be done. What good does being shy do now?" Marcus replied, shaking his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the next few days, Marcus didn't return to Solomia but stayed at Josie's house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By midday the next day, news broke of Ricardo Brown, the head of the Brown family, passing away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The news swept through all of Kingston, becoming the city's top headline of the day!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The news shocked countless people, with many speculating about Ricardo's cause of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Ricardo was the head of one of Uswad's top families and a formidable warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His influence and resources were immeasurable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For someone like that to die so suddenly was unbelievable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was akin to a super-guided bomb for Kingston's political and business landscape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By that afternoon, the ripple effects of Ricardo's death began to unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of the Brown family's business stocks in Kingston plummeted, and operations came to a halt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kingston's major families all rushed to claim a piece of the pie, frantically pooling their funds to acquire the Brown family's assets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a time, a frenzy of buying ensued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the death of one man, an era of a great family's dominance came to an end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amidst the chaos, a mysterious figure known only as "Death" invested 350 billion dollars to swiftly seize several of the Brown family's core industries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Entering at the lowest point of the stock crash, the moves were not only lightning-fast but remarkably calculated, completing acquisitions before the other Kingston families could react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many began speculating about the true identity of Death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After acquiring the companies, Death immediately implemented a series of actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first step was replacing the legal representatives, removing the Browns and appointing senior executives from within the companies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, everyone understood that this Death figure must have an extraordinary identity but was unwilling or unable to reveal themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, the companies were entrusted to others for management, but the real power behind them remained Death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For 350 billion dollars, Death had acquired four companies, all of which were renowned emerging high-tech enterprises in Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These companies were Sync Group, Rising Dragon Group, Pioneer Group, and Eastcomm Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although these companies' current business volumes were not on par with Kingston's established enterprises, they held immense potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With proper management and favorable winds, they could rise to prominence rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That day, Marcus left Sunshine Estates and went to the presidential suite at the top floor of Kingston's Hilton Hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sat in the executive chair, overlooking the bustling city below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moment later, the doorbell rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Four figures walked into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four individuals&mdash;three men and one woman&mdash;were the newly appointed CEOs of Sync Group, Rising Dragon Group, Pioneer Group, and Eastcomm Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We pay our respects to Lord Death!" they said in unison.</span></p><div class="pagination">
