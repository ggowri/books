  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stay low-key."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus waved his hand at Robert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The reason he could treat so many illnesses, including those deemed incurable was all thanks to Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were many healing techniques contained in Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, and Timeless Numinous Energy generated by it possessed unparalleled curative properties against virtually any disease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was completely different from warriors, wizards, metahumans, and other professions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unlike those who focused solely on personal strength, very few possessed any form of healing technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, even those who were born with healing powers were far inferior to Marcus in terms of medical skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Strictly speaking, except for the old man who gave the pendant to Marcus, few in this world could match Marcus' divine medical abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, Robert calling Marcus the formidable doctor in the world was no exaggeration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald's skills make 'low-key' impossible," Robert joked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I heard that you cured a patient with a ruptured appendix without surgery before. Is that true?" Mike asked Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus glanced at Mike and said, "A ruptured appendix is nothing to be surprised about. I've cured late-stage cancer patients. It was just as easy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His coming here was mainly for Robert, so he didn't really have to be low-key.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words left Jade, Jordon, and Mike visibly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Late-stage cancer was an illness universally recognized as terminal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even in a country with a developed medical industry like Acoton, late-stage cancer remained a mountain too high to climb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Compared with small appendicitis, late-stage cancer was an insurmountable obstacle, hundreds of times more difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it was unbelievable that Marcus could cure appendicitis without surgery, it was downright impossible to cure late-stage cancer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Jordon and Mike couldn't hold back their laughter, their expressions filled with mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Professor Cooper, are you sure this man is in his right mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mike finally spoke, looking incredulous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his view, no rational person would say such things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even boasting should have some basis in reality, yet Marcus' claims were utterly absurd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Mike Cole, please show some respect. Mr. Fitzgerald is also my honored guest. Today, we're here to discuss medicine, not resort to personal attacks!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the past, Robert would laugh out loud when he heard such claims.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' cure for late-stage cancer patients had long been confirmed by Charles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, this incident once caused an uproar in Solomia Hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the director of Solomia Hospital was shocked. How could it be fake?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Still, don't you think what this man said is complete nonsense?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Late-stage cancer is an incurable disease globally. In recent decades, many business tycoons and political leaders have succumbed to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And yet he claims to have cured it. Who could possibly believe that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mike's tone was filled with mockery, and he couldn't help laughing as he said it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon had already lost interest in the conversation. To him, both Marcus and Robert seemed to have lost their minds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, he had decided not to recommend Jade to Halvard Medical School.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If such a person is elected to the college in his name, there may be some trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Robert was so furious, at a loss for how to defend Marcus' abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus, however, remained calm, his gaze settling on Mike. After a brief moment, he spoke, "There is something growing on your pancreas. Because it's small and covered by fat, regular medical equipment wouldn't detect it. If you don't treat it soon, it will become cancerous within a month. If you've been drinking heavily lately, the cancer progression will accelerate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And the cells there are showing mutations. Once it turns cancerous, it will be late-stage immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since you come from a prominent medical family, you should know how deadly pancreatic cancer is. Take care of yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as this was said, Mike looked stunned and then burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His face filled with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is utter nonsense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon also looked disdainful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a professor at Halvard Medical School, he had spent his life in the medical field and seen countless illnesses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With access to the best resources, his family underwent thorough health checkups every six months, using the most advanced medical equipment and doctors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If something really grew on Mike's pancreas, Jordon would have discovered it long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon only felt that he had heard the funniest joke in the world.</span></p><div class="pagination">
