  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace Mitchell was lost in the lingering euphoria, her body still tingling from the overwhelming sensations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even as Marcus pulled away, a flicker of longing remained in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a soft, dreamy voice, she asked, "Mr. Fitzgerald, is it... over?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus gave her a warm smile. "Yes, we're done. Your blocked energy channels are fully cleared, and more than that&mdash;you've reached Ancient Martial Stage One. You're officially a martial artist now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus, observing her aura, silently marveled at the transformation. It was clear that his dual cultivation technique had accelerated her progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without it, there was no way she could've skipped the foundational steps and advanced so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even he hadn't reached Stage One until he'd mastered the basics of the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That meant Grace was walking on a quicker path than he had used to!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The statement took Grace by surprise, her eyes widening in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wait... I'm already at Stage One? You're not joking, right?" Grace's voice carried a mix of awe and excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before this, Marcus had given Grace a quick rundown on how Ancient Martial cultivation worked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, she already had a solid grasp of the different levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though the first level of Ancient Martial Arts was just the beginner stage, stepping into it would still elevate her body's capabilities far beyond that of an average person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus chuckled. "No joke. If you don't believe me, test it yourself&mdash;punch that table over there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace turned to the heavy wooden table Marcus had indicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It looked solid, crafted from dense timber, weighing hundreds of pounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She glanced down at her small, delicate hands, doubt creeping into her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Curiosity overpowered hesitation, and she raised her fist, throwing a casual punch at the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Crash!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The impact sent a thunderous crack echoing through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The massive table split in two, splintering into jagged pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the center of the destruction was a clear, fist-sized imprint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace stumbled back, her hands trembling as she stared at the wreckage. Her wide eyes flicked between the shattered table and her own fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How... How did I do that? I didn't even hit it that hard!" she exclaimed, her voice laced with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus laughed, clearly amused. "That's the power of a warrior. And this is just the beginning. As you continue to grow, your strength will only increase."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace looked at him with wonder. "This is... incredible. But, Mr. Fitzgerald, I don't understand&mdash;how did I reach Stage One without practicing any martial techniques? You told me before that reaching this level was extremely difficult."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus explained patiently, "It's because of the dual cultivation technique we used. It gave you immense benefits, allowing you to bypass the usual challenges and directly advance to Stage One."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace's cheeks flushed as realization dawned. "So... dual cultivation... that means... what we just did?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus nodded. "Yes, but it's more than just that. It's a precise technique that harmonizes masculine and feminine energies to unlock potential."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Does that mean if we... um... do it again, I'll get even stronger?" she asked hesitantly, her tone a mix of shyness and curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus smiled gently. "Theoretically, yes. But remember, personal effort is the foundation. Dual cultivation is a supplement&mdash;it's the icing on the cake, not the cake itself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I see..." Grace nodded thoughtfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Still, Mr. Fitzgerald, thank you so much. Without you, I would've never been able to experience this world, let alone become a martial artist."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus waved her gratitude away with a light laugh. "It's nothing. I just saw your determination to learn and wanted to help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace's gaze softened, her voice becoming playful. "So... it's only because I'm determined? Not because you like me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus blinked, caught off guard. "Of course, I like you. Who wouldn't? You're adorable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly realized the trap her question had set, smiling wryly at how easily women could twist conversations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One wrong answer might leave them a weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace leaned closer, her voice dropping to a whisper. "Do you think I'm beautiful, Mr. Fitzgerald?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes," he replied instantly. "Absolutely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You don't think less of me for... being forward earlier, do you?" she asked hesitantly, her cheeks turning pink at the memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was afraid that the slut she had momentarily turned into would leave Marcus a bad impression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' expression softened as he gently cupped her face. "Not at all. Don't overthink it, Grace. You've got nothing to worry about."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He pulled her into a warm embrace and kissed her deeply, pouring reassurance into the gesture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mmm..." Grace's soft moan escaped as the kiss deepened, her earlier shyness melting away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus, already fighting to keep his desires in check, found himself quickly giving in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His hands roamed down, parting her legs gently as their connection reignited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, their passion burned brighter, lasting nearly two hours before either could relent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By the end, Grace lay sprawled across the bed, her body utterly spent and her heart brimming with contentment.</span></p><div class="pagination">
