  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crimson light streaked through the air, moving with blinding speed and utter silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus had no time to react before it descended upon Yvonne's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes narrowed sharply, instinctively zeroing in on a particular spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There, he saw a face materialize, formed from swirling, bizarre patterns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The face was unnervingly sinister, with blood-red eyes and a smile that was almost mocking, as if daring Marcus to challenge it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne's body trembled violently as the red light rapidly morphed into a strange totem, which then sank into her skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Yvonne seemed entirely consumed by the red glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her complexion turned ashen, and she collapsed, losing consciousness completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' brows furrowed deeply. Without wasting a second, he scooped her up into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A surge of dark, malevolent energy rolled off her, making the hair on the back of his neck stand on end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without hesitation, he activated his X-ray vision, only to discover the totem had fully attached itself to her, draining her vitality with brutal force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her life force was rapidly slipping away, and Marcus could see her blood energy draining in real-time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Acting swiftly, Marcus summoned his Timeless Numinous Energy, channeling it into her body in a desperate attempt to stabilize her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The immense power he controlled usually had remarkable healing properties&mdash;often able to repair injuries almost instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Yvonne showed no signs of improvement. The totem continued to drain her as though nothing could stop it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His energy was only able to prevent her from slipping further into the abyss, keeping her on the edge of life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who's behind this?" Marcus thought, his eyes hardening with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew this attack wasn't meant for Yvonne&mdash;it was aimed at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, Michelle, Charles, and the others emerged from the hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When they saw Yvonne unconscious, her face pale as a ghost, Charles panicked. "Yvonne! What's happening? Don't scare me, sweetheart!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He immediately turned to Marcus. "Please, Mr. Fitzgerald, you have to save her! She's my only daughter! I can't lose her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a skilled doctor, Charles immediately recognized that Yvonne's life was hanging by a thread. It felt like a knife in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' face darkened further as he met Charles' gaze. "Mr. Miller, don't worry. This happened because of me, and I'll make sure she's okay. I give you my word."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a sharp turn, Marcus made to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They'd tried to kill him, but dragging Yvonne into this&mdash;that was the final straw. His anger flared, hot and sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whoever was behind this would regret it, and he'd find a way to save her, no matter the cost!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But before he could leave, Diana, wearing a sleek leather dress, stepped in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By the looks of it, she's been cursed with a blood spell, a particularly twisted form of dark magic from Southvaia. It's usually created through sacrifices&mdash;most likely involving dozens of souls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Once the curse is in the body, it starts draining a person's life force until they're nothing but a dry husk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The person who cast this curse is probably a very powerful Curse Weaver, and they've targeted you, Mr. Fitzgerald. If you go in blindly, you'll be walking right into their trap. Let me come with you instead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Curse Weaver..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus had heard of them, but they were a rare and mysterious group he'd never encountered personally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even during his time in the southwest of Uswad, he hadn't run into any.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To think they were now targeting him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus knew he had never wronged any Curse Weaver. T</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>his attack had to be orchestrated by someone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Regardless, whoever was responsible would have to face the consequences. Marcus was determined to make them pay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stay here and watch over them. I'll handle this," Marcus said, his voice firm and unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's expression remained serious. "To break the blood curse, you'll need the blood of the Curse Weaver who cast it. Be extra cautious, Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus gave her a brief nod, his resolve like steel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He turned on his heel and moved toward the direction where the sinister face had vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Take her somewhere quiet. I'll keep her alive," Diana instructed Charles and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Charles nodded and quickly carried Yvonne to the car, heading toward their villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Marcus stretched his spiritual powers, scanning the area around him for any signs of movement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a few moments, he detected several energy fluctuations similar to the curse that had affected Yvonne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without wasting time, Marcus hailed a taxi and rushed off in pursuit of the source.</span></p><div class="pagination">
