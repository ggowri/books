        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't explain but just took out his submachine gun and pulled the trigger at a rockery not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The light burst in the muzzle of the gun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rockery was shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a loud noise, the rockery directly collapsed and broke into rubble scattered on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene surprised Blake and Baron.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took a long time before they spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, what kind of gun is this? So powerful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This gun has the power of a mortar."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two trembled and were surprised that the small submachine gun had such great power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake and Baron nodded with fanaticism in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, are you really going to give us the gun?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were a little incredulous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The powerful gun must be expensive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it probably wouldn't be mass-produced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled, "Of course. I'll give you a hundred of these guns first. They'll arrive in about three days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he called Diana and told her the specific address of Axe Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, thank you so much. If we had a hundred of these guns, no one in Kingston could defeat us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake said with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I hope so."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded and said to Blake, "I'm busy, so I'll leave the aftermath to you guys."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake agreed happily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus left the Axe Gang and went to see Lila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, before he went to </span><span>Acoton</span><span>, he had promised her that he would return in two days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, he received a call from Lila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, are you back? I missed you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila's voice was soft and gentle and touched Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm back and just about to go to see you," Marcus replied calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Liar! You said you'd come to see me in two days, but now 48 hours and 53 minutes have passed," Lila said with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was surprised and helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My stepmother has come to Kingston and is now at my sister's house. I'll have dinner with them and my sister's boyfriend. Will you come with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila pleaded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked in surprise, "What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila took a deep breath and said, "My mother died when I was three years old. And my father remarried. My stepmother gave birth to my sister that year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was taken care of by my stepmother since I was a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although she is narrow-minded and snobby, she is pretty good to me. At least she never abused me since I was a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have always regarded her as my family. Even though my father is dead, I go home to visit her every year."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus understood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila grew up in a reorganized family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she was relatively lucky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least her stepmother was nice to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, what do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila asked with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were in a relationship now, after all, and Marcus wouldn't say no to Lila's request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Marcus and Lila met at Lila's home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila put on her makeup and clothes before she went downstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had dinner at a famous restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila's stepmother, Jacqueline Sassoon, sister, Liz Sassoon, and Liz's boyfriend, Abraham Toynbee, had already arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lila, we missed you so much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacqueline said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she and Lila had no blood relationship, they had a good relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liz said sarcastically with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, Lila is a star now and very busy. It's not easy for us to see her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a good thing. I hope you will be better in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacqueline smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Speaking, Jacqueline and Liz involuntarily looked at Marcus, who was standing next to Lila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liz asked, "Lila, who is this?"</span></p></div>
