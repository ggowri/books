        <h1>Chapter 864 Max Durant-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His father might be the Commander of the </span><span>Rowane</span><span> Military District.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, his father was getting on in years and approaching retirement age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once his father retired, their family's influence in the </span><span>Uswad</span><span> military would plummet </span><span>dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being around the same age as Cody, Marcus already wielded military authority equal to Cody's father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was crystal clear that Marcus would surpass his father's position, given enough time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Cody hadn't humbled himself before Marcus now, he might have ended his military career in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't mind that you didn't recognize me, but let me give you some friendly advice. Young men shouldn't let their tempers get the best of them. You must know when to pull your punches and avoid burning bridges even in sparring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll pay a heavy price if you don't learn this lesson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they were the same age, Marcus spoke like a seasoned mentor guiding a rookie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This mentoring tone struck a nerve with the typically proud Cody.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had to bite his tongue. After all, this was Special Advisor speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If even his father had to show respect to this man, what right did a mere staff officer like himself have to talk back?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've heard so much about your heroic deeds, Mr. Fitzgerald," Max said with admiration. "Meeting you today confirms that you're exceptional. A young hero indeed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Max's gaze settled on Marcus as he spoke with a warm smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He extended his hand in a welcoming gesture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gladly accepted the handshake and replied, "You're too kind, Sir. I was passing by. It's nothing worth mentioning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope you'll forgive my unannounced visit," Max continued with a friendly smile. "I simply couldn't pass up the chance to meet you in person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Max was Commander of the </span><span>Rowane</span><span> Military District, wielding considerable power and influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing someone of his stature showing such humility while speaking with Marcus was remarkable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After exchanging pleasantries for a while, Max departed with Cody in tow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The area now belonged solely to Marcus and Maxine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's large eyes sparkled with curiosity as she stared intently at Marcus as if examining some fascinating discovery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you staring at?" Marcus asked, shifting uncomfortably under her gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there something on my face?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine shook her head and replied, "Nothing like that. I can't believe you're the Special Advisor everyone's been talking about lately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I told you before, but you wouldn't believe me. You only trust something after it's been proven. That's quite interesting," Marcus said with a shrug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's face flushed as she protested, "I found it too incredible! I wasn't looking down on you at all, Marcus. Please don't be mad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine grabbed Marcus' arm and gave it a gentle shake, displaying an unusually girlish expression that was rare for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This surprised Marcus, who had always viewed Maxine as a strong-willed woman who could stand up to any man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never seen her show such a vulnerable side before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's an easy way to make me stop being angry," Marcus said with a playful tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want? Just tell me!" Maxine asked, her smile brightening with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give me a kiss, and all will be forgiven," Marcus said, pointing to his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's pretty face turned bright red instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nevertheless, she stood on her tiptoes and planted a quick kiss on Marcus' lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's my girl," Marcus said with a hearty laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go. You've met Special Advisor, which fulfills Mr. Wilde's request."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine nodded gently, tilting her face to study Marcus' chiseled profile. A glimmer of admiration flashed in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After learning about Marcus' other identity, her respect for him had grown considerably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She found herself developing a genuine sense of admiration for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Maxine left, Marcus returned to Bayside Villa. He entered his room to begin processing the energy he had just devoured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His opponent had been an Acquired State Two expert whose body contained a terrifyingly vast amount of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Marcus had completed reconstructing his physical form, and his energy channels had become countless times stronger than those at the Foundation Establishment Stage, he could still feel waves of splitting pressure throughout his body.</span></p></div>
