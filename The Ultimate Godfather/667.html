        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Natalie heard it, an awkward expression appeared on her face. "Dad, Marcus is just my high school classmate, not my boyfriend. Please don't say things like that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Payne wasn't convinced at all. He gave Marcus another scrutinizing look before saying, "Don't lie to me. If he's not your boyfriend, why would he be bringing you home this late? You two must've been up to no good. I wasn't born yesterday. This is the first time I've ever seen a man bring you home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then turned to Marcus and declared, "Listen, kid, if you want to marry my daughter, it's not impossible. My wife is bedridden and sick, and I have a son who just graduated </span><span>from </span><span>college and needs a wife. You'll need to bring at least five million dollars for the wedding gift. Without it, don't even think about </span><span>marrying</span><span> my daughter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Payne grabbed his bottle of liquor and disappeared into the apartment building, not sparing Marcus another glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie gave Marcus an apologetic smile. She said, "Marcus, I'm so sorry. My dad's had too much to drink. I hope you don't mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching the scene that had just unfolded, Marcus suddenly realized that Natalie's life wasn't as glamorous as she made it seem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I don't mind," Marcus replied, shaking his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie laughed bitterly, "Of course, why would you care? We probably won't see each other much in the future anyway."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mind wandered back to what Marcus had said in the car earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp pang of pain rose in her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not because she feared losing Marcus but because she realized she might actually have feelings for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, changed the subject. He asked, "Tell me about your family. I remember a few years ago, your parents were working in state-run jobs. Now, things seem very different."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Encouraged by Marcus' genuine interest, Natalie began to speak, "Back then, my family was doing well. But later, both of my parents were laid off. My mom was diagnosed with cancer, and my younger brother needed to go to college. Everything fell apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The whole burden fell on my dad's shoulders. A few years ago, my father worked tirelessly to support my mom's medical treatment and pay for my brother's education.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But whether it was bad luck or something else, nothing my father did seemed to go right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After a string of setbacks, he lost all hope in society and started drinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At first, it wasn't much, but now he's drunk every single day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I had just graduated high school when all this happened. I didn't go to college. I started working to support my family instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I saved every penny I could for my mom's medical bills and to pay for my brother's tuition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My dad's getting older, and his drinking problem keeps getting worse. He's very traditional, and he strongly favors my brother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To him, I'm probably just a tool to support my brother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Natalie spoke, her eyes filled with tears, making her look fragile and pitiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why am I even telling you this? I've gotten used to it. I just need to keep working hard to pay for my mom's treatment. Now that my brother has graduated, my dad is fixated on finding him a wife. Once I've saved enough for his wedding gift, my mission will be complete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm a store manager at a jewelry shop now. I make over thirty thousand dollars a month. Compared to most people, I'm doing pretty well. I guess, in a way, life hasn't been too unfair to me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her last words sounded like self-comfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was moved by Natalie's story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, he felt like he was truly understanding her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the surface, Natalie appeared materialistic and money-driven. But it wasn't her nature. Her environment had shaped her that way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During her high school years, both of her parents were laid off, and her mother was diagnosed with cancer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her family's situation took a sudden turn for the worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this was a crucial period for shaping her character and values.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In such a family environment, it was only natural for Natalie's desire for money to be stronger than most people's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she didn't earn money, her family wouldn't be able to function.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take me to see your mom. Maybe I can help," Marcus said to Natalie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie froze, clearly surprised by his offer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, I didn't tell you all this to make you feel sorry for me. I just wanted to share my story because my dad brought it up. I don't usually talk about this with anyone, not even my coworkers at the jewelry store. So don't feel like you have to pity me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled, "I don't pity you. I just want to visit your mom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?" Natalie asked, skeptical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't believe me, I'll leave right now," Marcus replied, pretending to turn away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie quickly grabbed his hand. "Marcus, don't go. I'll take you to her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Natalie grabbed Marcus' hand and led him toward the exit of Dawnview Gardens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They got back into Marcus' Aston Martin and drove off.</span></p></div>
