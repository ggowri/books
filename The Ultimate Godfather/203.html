  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew turned to Shaun and said, "Shaun, I truly hope you marry Maxine. What happened today is entirely Maxine's fault, and I'll make sure to give you an explanation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, that man came to the Burnett Villa without our permission. We should throw him out immediately!" Malcolm said to Matthew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had nearly ruined his plans, and he didn't want him to stay any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly. The Burnett family is one of the four major families in Kingston. No one, especially someone like him, should be allowed in here. Maxine has gone too far; she needs to be properly disciplined."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ruth immediately chimed in, adding fuel to the fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew, however, raised a hand to silence them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze fell on Maxine, and he said, "Maxine, our family has always treated our guests with courtesy. Although this man you brought here didn't seek permission from me, he's still a guest, and we should treat him as such.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today is my 80th birthday, and everyone present has brought me gifts. Shaun's gift, in particular, is filled with sincerity. Now, Maxine, tell me, what kind of gift has this man, the one you insist on marrying, prepared for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Matthew's words, many guests turned their attention to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could this nobody somehow manage to catch Maxine's eye? He doesn't seem like someone of status. No way he could bring a gift as valuable as Shaun's. Even a gift on par with the others in the room seems beyond him. Sir Burnett's move is absolutely brilliant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, if he can't come up with a decent gift, he'll probably have no face to stick around here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guests whispered among </span><span>themselves,</span><span> casting looks of disdain toward Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were all prominent figures in Kingston, and they couldn't help but feel superior </span><span>to someone like Marcus, a complete nobody.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's face flushed with embarrassment. Her impulsive kiss had dragged Marcus into this mess, and now, her grandfather's unreasonable demand made her regret everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she knew her grandfather wasn't really interested in the gift but rather trying to push Marcus to back off, she still felt guilty for putting him in such a difficult position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandfather Marcus came in such a hurry that he didn't have time to prepare a gift. I'll cover for him and provide one in his place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At these words, many in the crowd sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they had suspected, this man was nothing more than a penniless nobody.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't even bring a proper gift and had to rely on Maxine to cover for him. It made them wonder what Maxine even saw in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaun shot a mocking glance at Marcus. Seeing Maxine defend him like this only made his hatred for Marcus grow stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your grandpa is asking for a gift from Marcus. How can it be the same if you provide it for him? Maxine, stop protecting this man. If he's truly a man, he should have some pride. If he can't bring a decent gift, he should just leave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ruth echoed similar sentiments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arnold remained silent, but his expression was one of amusement as if he was just watching the drama unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen, Hazel, and Stella didn't dare speak. They all felt Maxine's actions were indefensible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing full well that Shaun was coming to propose today, she still brought along a useless man and kissed him in front of everyone. They felt it was a shameful act that disgraced the entire Burnett family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them even thought it would be a good opportunity to give Maxine a lesson, as she was simply too headstrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maxine, my actions aren't excessive. If you're going to marry him, then he'll be my family. Isn't it only right for him to bring me a gift?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew's voice was laced with mockery as he aimed to humiliate Marcus in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's face was a mixture of anger and frustration as she prepared to defend Marcus, but before she could speak, Marcus raised a hand, signaling her to stay silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Marcus stepped forward and looked Matthew in the eye. "First, as a younger generation, I wish you a happy 80th birthday, Sir Burnett. As Maxine said, I came in such a rush that I didn't have time to prepare a gift for you, but that doesn't mean I came empty-handed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Marcus reached into his Spatial Ring and pulled out a small vial containing a medicinal pill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pill could cleanse toxins from the body and enhance one's strength, and it was especially effective for older individuals.</span></p><div class="pagination">
