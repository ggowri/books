  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, many people fixed their eyes on Marcus and scrutinized him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the atmosphere nearly reaching a fever pitch, Albert sneered, "Marcus, quit stalling and show us your gift. It doesn't have to outshine the Angel's Kiss, but surely it can't be shoddier than the ring I gave Jade, can it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plenty of people nodded in agreement, and their viewpoints were nearly identical to Albert's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyway, Jade hailed from a middle-class family in Solariae. Her father held the position of the chief physician at Solariae Hospital, and currently, she served as the director of Solomia Hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If her boyfriend couldn't even afford a diamond ring worth 280 thousand dollars, that was truly unacceptable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do you know that my gift must be worse than yours?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The way Albert talked really grated on Marcus. Naturally, he understood Albert's motives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, Albert came here today to show off, aiming both to flaunt having found a girlfriend like Luna and make Jade regretful, as well as to outshine Marcus with expensive gifts and embarrass him in front of Jade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having encountered numerous ploys similar to Albert's, Marcus had remained silent previously, hoping he would be sensible enough to stop on his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Albert actually became even more aggressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' question stunned everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert asked, "Do you mean that your gift is better than mine?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's 280 thousand dollars. Hey, what's your annual salary? Can you earn that much money? If not, stop bragging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The majority of us at this age have only recently graduated from college. Without depending on our parents, we can't make much money. Do you believe everyone has the means to be like me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words immediately resonated with many people present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though their families were affluent, only Jade and Albert had actually achieved notable success</span><span> on their own</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others obtained their current positions thanks to their parents' connections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus seemed to be about their own age. In view of the manner in which Jade had earlier introduced him to them, everyone was apt to surmise that he was not in a high position and was probably at the bottom of the social scale.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I mean, it's better than the Angel's Kiss, not the diamond ring."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As everyone was discussing, Marcus' voice rang out again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes widened in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert smiled mockingly, "Do you mean the gift you prepared for Jade is better than the Angel's Kiss?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied, "Yes. Jade is my girlfriend, and she deserves the best gift in the world!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After these words were uttered, many people laughed scornfully and gazed at him with derision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A girl said, "A gift better than the Angel's Kiss? You're quite the braggart. You don't seem like someone with wealth. How on earth could you manage to afford a gift that is superior to the Angel's Kiss?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly. I reckon he knows he can't measure up to Albert, so he is bragging."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Multiple girls chatted among themselves, showing no consideration for Marcus' feelings. Their voices were quite loud as if they deliberately wanted him to hear every word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a look of pride on his face, Albert exclaimed, "In that case, I'm eager to see what gift you've purchased. Enough talk&mdash;show it to all of us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he finished speaking, Marcus pulled out a very ordinary box from his pocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the custom jewelry store, he was in such a rush that the Tears of the Angel wasn't put into a stunning gift box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sight of the ordinary box, many people took on mocking expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were sure that Marcus, in his position, couldn't afford expensive gifts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the moment he opened the box, the azure light, illuminated by the lights, instantly embraced the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was so charming, shining many times more brightly than the Angel's Kiss that Albert had previously presented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone froze in disbelief, and their hearts raced uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the Tears of the Angel! No way! How is this possible? He actually purchased the Tears of the Angel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amid the crowd, an incredulous exclamation rang out, causing everyone to come back to their senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that Marcus' gift was the Tears of the Angel, a piece of jewelry lauded as the king of this year's jewelry offerings by the entire industry, was completely beyond their wildest imaginations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Albert took out the Angel's Kiss just now, everyone was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the sight of the Tears of the Angel dumbfounded them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a livid face, Albert was incredulous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately growled. "Impossible! This is absolutely impossible. The Tears of the Angel must be fake. He can't possibly afford such an expensive gift!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
