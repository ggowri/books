  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, all the experts of the Leah family couldn't help but look up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After seeing the flare, their expressions instantly turned grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The reason was simple: this flare was the Leah family's highest-level summoning signal, only released when the Leah Manor was invaded by a powerful enemy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, a flare of such level was released from the direction of Emotionless Gorge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This immediately alarmed many experts of the Leah family, prompting them to rush toward Emotionless Gorge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In a cave within the Leah Manor, nine elders were each meditating, surrounded by a faint halo, exuding an aura of profoundness and power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were the nine Grandmasters Gertie mentioned, the strongest individuals of the Leah family, and the very reason the Leah family had survived for thousands of years in the depths of the Kinton Mountains.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their cultivation was all above Acquired State Five, and each possessed extraordinary strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More importantly, the nine of them could form the immensely powerful Ennead Rotation Celestial Formation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It could elevate the strength of all nine to a higher level. For many years, no one in the depths of the Kinton Mountains had been able to break it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, someone from the Leah family came to report, looking very solemn, and said, "Grandmasters, a powerful enemy has invaded our home. A signal flare was launched from the direction of Emotionless Gorge. Please go and investigate the situation."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Leah family hadn't launched a signal flare of this level for many years, so it must be a powerful enemy invasion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, the nine Grandmasters of the Leah family awoke from their cultivation, their eyes sharp and piercing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Trevor Leah, an elderly man with white hair and beard, was the first to stand up, exuding a faint coercion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just standing there casually, he gave off an unbeatable aura.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who dares to forcefully intrude into the Leah Manor? Follow me to check it out." Saying this, Trevor was the first to step out of the cave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other eight Grandmasters followed behind him. Soon, their bodies soared into the air, heading together toward Emotionless Gorge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Apart from these nine Grandmasters, many other experts from the Leah family also rushed to Emotionless Gorge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A signal flare from Minerva alarmed everyone in the Leah family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Emotionless Gorge, watching Minerva fire the signal flare, Gertie's face darkened further, and she couldn't help but question, "Minerva, Marcus has already spared you. Why did you release the signal flare?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Gertie's view, Minerva's actions were a bit excessive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He&rsquo;s so arrogant. I must make him pay!" Minerva said through gritted teeth. In her view, as long as the nine Grandmasters arrived, Marcus would surely die.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie's face was grim. She quickly looked at Marcus and said, "Marcus, the nine Grandmasters are coming. You should leave Emotionless Gorge quickly. Otherwise, I&rsquo;m afraid..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of them is bound to die.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie was afraid that Marcus might be injured by the nine Grandmasters, and also feared that the nine Grandmasters might be injured by Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, she felt that the most important thing she needed to do now was to prevent this conflict.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though Minerva fired the signal flare, Marcus remained indifferent. He glanced at Minerva and said, "Doesn't she want the nine Grandmasters of the Leah family to suppress me? I'll give her this chance to see what true power is."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Marcus's words, Gertie knew that Marcus had been angered by Minerva.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew Marcus's personality very well and understood that his decisions were hard to change.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Minerva sarcastically said to Marcus, "Do you really think that just because you used an artifact to defeat me, you have the right to act arrogant in front of the nine Grandmasters of the Leah family? Let me tell you, your strength is far from enough."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't want to pay attention to her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Almost at the same time, strange sounds echoed in the void.</span></p><div class="pagination">
