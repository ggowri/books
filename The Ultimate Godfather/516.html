        <h1>Chapter 515 Kent Explains</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina's face flushed red with embarrassment. "Grandpa, it's far too early to talk about marriage. Please stop mentioning it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, alright, my granddaughter is shy. I won't say anything more," Bowden chuckled heartily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His granddaughter had always been a staunch advocate of not getting married and never showed any interest in dating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the sons of prestigious families in Kingston failed to catch her eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, both Bowden and Davey's family were deeply worried about Melina's future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were consumed with concern over her lifelong happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who would have thought she would end up with someone as influential as Marcus?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the mighty </span><span>Battle God</span><span> Oliver was deferential in Marcus' presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did Marcus hold an exalted status, but his medical skills were also unparalleled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bowden's late-stage lung cancer, which had seemed untreatable, was cured by Marcus in less than half an hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such an extraordinary figure had been completely unheard of before. Compared to him, Tom, whom Landon brought in, was nothing but trash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was ridiculous how much faith they had placed in Tom earlier, even helping him oppose Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking back now, it all seemed utterly foolish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That evening, to honor Marcus, the Thurman family prepared a lavish banquet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the family attended, with Marcus joining as Melina's boyfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, at the Whitman family residence, Landon had already had his injured finger bandaged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the bitterness of the day's events still consumed him. He was scheming relentlessly, determined to make Marcus pay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Father, I don't understand. You are the head of the Whitman family. Even if many of our industries are now under the control of the Deleon family, why must we fear that so-called </span><span>Battle God</span><span> Oliver and Marcus?" Landon asked with frustration as Kent walked into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kent sighed deeply, "Your uncle might be the head of the Deleon family, but he wields no real power. Everything in the Deleon family is still controlled by Jasper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And Oliver is the one he holds in the highest regard. Even your uncle has to show deference to Oliver within the family. That is why I have no choice but to fear him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And as for Marcus, he's no ordinary person either. Do you know why even Oliver treats him with such respect?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Landon asked curiously, "Why? I also want to know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kent explained, "From what I've gathered, Marcus has deep connections with the Godfather. Even more astonishing is his overwhelming personal strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Last time, when the leader of the Black Hawk Legion, Josiah Abel, came to Uswad, Oliver and his special forces assembled in Solomia to apprehend him. Instead, they were cornered by Josiah at the data center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was Marcus who turned the tide. He annihilated every member of the Black Hawk Legion and saved Oliver and over a dozen special forces operatives. Because of this, people call him the Death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus was also involved in the downfall of Kingston's Brown family. And let's not forget that your uncle, the former head of the Deleon family, was killed by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With the kind of power Marcus holds now, eliminating the two of us would be effortless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think you can mess with someone like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kent's words sent shockwaves through Landon's heart, making his entire body tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally understood why his father was willing to publicly cut off one of his fingers to gain Marcus' forgiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was such an unstoppable force!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that the former heir of the Deleon family, Shaun, had died because of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More recently, even the Whitman family's former head, Barlow, had been silently eliminated by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Kent had said, if Marcus ever decided to act against them, it would be as effortless as snapping his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reflecting on his previous defiance toward Marcus at the Thurman family, Landon realized how close he had been to courting death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I warn you. From now on, if you ever encounter Marcus again, you must show him absolute respect. Do not entertain even a shred of vengeance. If you do, it will undoubtedly spell the end for both of us," Kent continued to instruct Landon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though resentment still lingered in Landon's heart, he could only nod in submission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was clearly someone he could not afford to provoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Losing a finger today was proof of his blindness and foolishness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a servant entered and announced, "Mr. Kent Whitman, Neil and his daughter Cloe request an audience."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kent frowned, turned to Landon, and said, "If it weren't for them, you wouldn't have offended both Marcus and </span><span>Battle God</span><span> Oliver. You handle this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Landon's expression turned icy as he agreed with his father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rising from his seat, he strode out with an air of hostility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Whitman, we've been expelled from the Thurman family and are now homeless. We have no choice but to seek your protection!" Neil bowed to Landon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Landon slapped Neil across the face without hesitation and sneered, "You old fool! How dare you show your face here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it weren't for you and your daughter, how would I have ended up offending Marcus?"</span></p></div>
