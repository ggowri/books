        <h1>Chapter 164 Professor Cooper</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's gaze towards Marcus had changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never expected that Marcus would actually dare to sever Pete's arm in front of everyone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Maxine felt that Marcus' move wasn't just satisfying; it was also quite dominant, even a bit cool!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never imagined that one day, she would have such a dramatic shift in her perception of the man standing before her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking back to their first meeting at Kingston Airport, Maxine had once regarded Marcus as just another opportunistic lecher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, reflecting on it, she suddenly realized how rash and hasty she had been back then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, you've done our </span><span>Uswad</span><span> nation proud! On behalf of the Solomia government, I </span><span>wanna</span><span> thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin walked over, extending his hand to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, he had seen Marcus as nothing more than a brave but naive young man, but now, his attitude towards Marcus had shifted to that of an equal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mayor Benjamin, you're too kind. It was the least I could do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he wasn't a diehard patriot, as a </span><span>Uswad</span><span> citizen, he couldn't stand Pete's arrogant attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, by cutting off Pete's arm, the Hudson family from Eldoria won't let this slide easily. You should be cautious moving forward."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin warned Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Hudson family not only held immense power in Eldoria, but they also had significant influence worldwide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't possibly just let this go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't say much, only nodding in acknowledgment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had heard of the Hudson family, and if they dared come after him, he would ensure they would regret it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is Edward?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin asked, concerned about Edward's injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just called Professor Cooper. He should be here soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brenden replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin raised an eyebrow. "Professor Cooper? Do you mean Robert Cooper, the chief surgeon at </span><span>Solariae</span><span> Hospital?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brenden nodded. "Yes, that Robert. He's also from Solomia and has been on a break here recently."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Edward's injuries are serious. I don't trust the local surgeons, so I had to bring in Professor Cooper."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, Benjamin, Maxine, and the others felt a sense of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert was not only a well-known figure in </span><span>Solariae's</span><span> surgical field, but he was also highly respected in the entire </span><span>Uswad</span><span> medical community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially in bone fracture surgeries, he had extensive clinical experience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Brenden bringing in Robert, it seemed Edward had a chance at recovery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it might take time, at least he should be able to live independently again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, several doctors in white coats rushed into the venue, and the crowd instinctively parted to make way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leading them was none other than Robert, the chief surgeon from </span><span>Solariae</span><span> Hospital!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Professor Cooper, I'm sorry to bother you while you're on vacation. I owe you one, big time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brenden greeted him warmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert waved it off. "Brenden, no need for formalities. Just buy me a drink next time. And remember, I want that special 1958 vintage. Don't be stingy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brenden chuckled. "No problem! As long as you can save Edward, I'll buy you the whole cellar if you want!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Brenden motioned towards Benjamin. "Oh, Mayor Benjamin's here too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert followed Brenden's gesture and quickly spotted Marcus beside Benjamin. His expression froze for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, what a surprise! You're also here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene from a month ago, at the matchmaking dinner for Yvonne and Haley, flashed through his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Robert had thought of Marcus as nothing more than a poor farmer's son, someone unworthy of Yvonne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the dinner, Robert had made several snide remarks about Marcus, even insulting him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then Marcus had stunned everyone with his extravagant gift, silencing everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to that unpleasant incident earlier, Robert remained unaware of Marcus' exact identity until the end of the banquet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected to run into him again here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Professor Cooper, do you know Marcus?" Brenden asked, surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. We had attended the same banquet together a month ago."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert nodded and stepped forward to greet Benjamin, Marcus, Maxine, and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After exchanging pleasantries with Benjamin, Robert turned to Marcus. "Mr. Fitzgerald, we meet again."</span></p></div>
