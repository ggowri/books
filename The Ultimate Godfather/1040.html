  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like that saying is true. Experience makes all the difference!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even though Evander was appointed as the new president by Mr. Death, it seems like he can't beat Miles."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miles has been thriving at Royal Entertainment for a reason. He's definitely no pushover!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, who would have thought that Miles actually has so many armed men at his disposal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It looks like Evander and his team are in trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At how casually Miles called in so many armed subordinates, people around them began whispering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most people thought that Evander would be the loser in this power struggle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They also believed that Marcus, who had impersonated Death, would be harshly dealt with by Royal Entertainment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, Evander, have you ever thought that one day, your life would be in my hands?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miles stood with his hands behind his back, a proud look in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He casually walked towards the direction where Marcus, Evander, and the others were standing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miles had always dealt with Evander cautiously, preferring to avoid conflict.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Evander had crossed a line, and now Miles had no choice but to make him pay for his arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evander's face darkened. He hadn't expected Miles to have so many armed people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given the situation, it was highly likely that things could spiral out of control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately thought of protecting Marcus. "Mr. Fitzgerald, Miles may be out of his mind. It's not safe here. I'll hold him off. Mr. Fitzgerald, you and Chloe should leave quickly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miles' expression twisted with madness as he gritted his teeth and said, "No one is leaving without my orders. If anyone dares to leave, I'll blow their head off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Miles' eyes, Marcus and Evander were a team. Since he had already decided to deal with Evander, he wouldn't let Marcus walk away unharmed, either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, Evander's face turned even darker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Miles and said, "Miles, are you crazy? Do you dare to lay a hand on Mr. Death? You really want to die, don't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miles sneered, "What, Mr. Death? Even if he's real, he made you president of Royal Entertainment, so he's still going to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe's expression also turned grim. She quietly spoke to Marcus, "Marcus, this is all my fault. If you weren't standing up for me, you wouldn't have crossed Miles. It's my fault, and now you're caught up in this mess..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had been watching Miles' arrogance with calm eyes the entire time as if it were just a performance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing Chloe, he gave her a reassuring look and said, "Don't worry. This guy can't do anything to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been letting him talk because I wanted to see just how arrogant he is.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's also a good way to uncover all his power within Royal Entertainment so we can uproot all his influence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus said this, Chloe was momentarily stunned. But before she could speak, Marcus turned his body, his gaze fixed on Miles. He said, "These are all the armed forces you control, right? If you've got more, bring them all out. Let's handle this together. I don't want to waste time with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus said this, everyone in the room was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people showed strange expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never expected the young man to start babbling like this. It seemed like he had been scared senseless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With dozens of armed men, that wasn't enough. Now he wanted Miles to call even more armed people? Wasn't that the definition of crazy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miles sneered and said, "Kid, tell me the truth. Are you freaking out? You seem a little off to me. If you keep talking, I'll have someone blow your head off right here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Miles gave a command to one of the armed men standing next to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go, tie this guy up and slap him hard until his mouth is bloody!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The armed man immediately obeyed, stepping forward to grab Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before the man could lay a hand on Marcus, a gunshot rang out in the banquet hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a blood-soaked hole the size of a bowl appeared in the man's forehead, and his body fell straight to the ground, lifeless!</span></p><div class="pagination">
