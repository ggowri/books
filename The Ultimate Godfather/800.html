        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no doubt that this was Julian's doing, and he couldn't help but marvel at the reach and influence the leader commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had only shared his name with Julian, yet within three days, Julian had tracked him down, processed the commendation, and even delivered it personally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That level of efficiency was nothing short of astonishing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, rest assured. This commendation has been handled with the utmost discretion. No information about you has been shared publicly, and all footage of your actions online has been scrubbed. Your privacy will remain completely intact," said the Colonel with a respectful tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Appreciated," Marcus replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to admit, they'd thought of everything. They'd even anticipated that Marcus wasn't the type to seek the limelight, taking great care to protect his anonymity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Additionally, the Commander is interested in recruiting you into the military. If you accept, you'll start with at least the rank of Brigadier General," the Colonel continued, cautiously testing the waters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus shook his head without hesitation. "I'm too used to my freedom. Military life isn't for me&mdash;I'd rather not be tied down by protocols."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus' firm refusal, the Colonel nodded and didn't push further. Instead, he smiled and said, "Understood. My name is Jareth Falkner, Deputy Commander of the Solace Military Division. If you ever need my assistance, don't hesitate to call me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Jareth handed Marcus a business card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus took the card and slipped it casually into his pocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a few more pleasantries, Jareth and his team left Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, you're a First-Class Combat Hero now?" Pearl asked, her eyes wide with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled, "All I did was help out&mdash;it's hardly worth calling me a hero. Just hang the certificate somewhere, would you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He handed the certificate to Pearl and tucked the medal into his Spatial Ring before heading back inside to relax.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was settling in, his phone rang, the sharp tone breaking the quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at the screen&mdash;it was Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's when he remembered he hadn't seen Grace in over a month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wondered how her martial arts training had progressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Answering the call, he asked, "Grace, what's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace's voice was frantic on the other end. "Mr. Fitzgerald, my dad's been arrested... They came from Kingston and took him! Please, I need your help... I don't know what to do..." She broke into sobs, her voice trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' brows furrowed instantly. "Calm down and tell me exactly what happened."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin, the mayor of </span><span>Solomia</span><span>, was known for being a diligent and upright official. His sudden arrest by Kingston authorities didn't sit right with Marcus&mdash;it smelled of foul play.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through Grace's halting explanation, Marcus pieced together the story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ones who had taken Benjamin were from the Office of Inspector General, OIG.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had come quietly, arrested him in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>, and taken him back to Kingston, where he was now being held.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The charges were severe&mdash;embezzlement, bribery, abuse of power, collusion with foreign entities, and gross negligence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What made it worse was the evidence the authorities had presented&mdash;solid enough to ensure a conviction and a lifetime sentence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that whoever was behind this wanted Benjamin gone for good, leaving him no chance of redemption.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't panic. Let's meet in person, and you can fill me in on all the details," Marcus reassured her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace couldn't hold back her tears and began sobbing openly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin's arrest was obviously hitting her hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After ending the call, Marcus grabbed his keys and drove straight to Grace's house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he arrived, she was already waiting anxiously by the door.</span></p></div>
