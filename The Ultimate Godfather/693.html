  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't even spare a glance at these women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After pocketing the Bloodthirsty Cult leader's Spatial Ring, Marcus turned his gaze outside the hall and said, "If you don't</span><span> show up</span><span>, I'll be rude to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door of the hall was pushed open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several Curse Weavers entered from outside the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the forefront was a gaunt, older man with white hair and a beard, bearing a Southvaia visage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beside the older man stood a robust middle-aged man whose cultivation had reached the peak of Level Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Curse Weavers behind them were at the level five or six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am the founder of the Bloodthirsty Cult. I've come with the mid and high-level members of the Bloodthirsty Cult to pay our respects to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, the older man dropped to one </span><span>knee</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others followed suit with expressions of respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes glinted as he queried the old man, "I've slain your leader. Don't you seek revenge? Why are you doing this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Marcus' words, the older man kept bowing, and his body trembled involuntarily. "You are incredibly powerful. We dare not entertain the idea of revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're here to pledge our loyalty to you, sir."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was surprised. "What? Why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The older man said, "The leader of the Bloodthirsty Cult is deceased. The Bloodthirsty Cult cannot afford to be leaderless, yet there's no one within the cult capable of shouldering the task. Thus, on behalf of all members of the Bloodthirsty Cult, I offer our loyalty to you. We hope you'll accede to our request and lead the Bloodthirsty Cult!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Other high-ranking figures of the Bloodthirsty Cult echoed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said calmly, "I appreciate it, but I truly don't have the time to lead the Bloodthirsty Cult."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The older man said disappointedly, "The Bloodthirsty Cult will be left leaderless and will soon be gobbled up by other forces. A thousand years of our business will be destroyed..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus inquired in surprise, "Isn't the Bloodthirsty Cult part of Roger's power? How dare other forces assail the Bloodthirsty Cult?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The older man said self-mockingly, "Mr. Roger Gellar holds such a lofty status and doesn't care a low-level sect like ours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Roger Gellar only used us from time to time. Once we're no longer of use, we will be cast aside at will."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was immediately enlightened. After thinking, he said, "If that's the case, you may continue to maintain your autonomy and elect a new leader. If you are in trouble, you can turn to me for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But once you choose to submit to me, don't harbor any thoughts of betrayal. If you do, I'll eliminate you once I discover it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A glimmer of joy sparkled on the face of the older man. He hastily said, "Rest assured, sir. Since we have chosen to submit ourselves to you, we will not betray you. Otherwise, we will be damned!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other members of the Bloodthirsty Cult echoed the older man's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had witnessed the battle between Marcus and the Bloodthirsty Cult leader and were filled with admiration for the terrifying might Marcus had displayed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, they dare not to entertain any thoughts of revenge. After careful deliberation, they opted to surrender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only in this way could the Bloodthirsty Cult endure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why don't you be the new leader?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said to the older man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The older man coughed and said, "I'm far too old to hold an important position. Please reconsider!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked at a Curse Weaver at the peak of Level Seven beside the older man and asked, "You're one of the four guardians, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man kept his bow and nodded respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said, "How about you assume the role of the new leader?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words were immediately endorsed by the members of the Bloodthirsty Cult, who all voiced their approval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, sir. I will serve you with all my heart and soul until I die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The new Bloodthirsty Cult leader bowed to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the older man asked Marcus, "May I have the honor of knowing your name?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said, "Just call me Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They nodded promptly and said, "Yes, Mr. Fitzgerald!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved his hands and issued an order. "Even if you are Curse Weavers, do not do anything to hurt innocent people. Otherwise, I won't be lenient!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, a potent aura erupted from Marcus, making the space oppressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone quivered, and their foreheads were beaded with cold sweat.</span></p><div class="pagination">
