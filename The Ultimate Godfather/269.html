        <h1>Chapter 268 Ruin His Cultivation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Truman only met Camila and Jennifer for the first time, these two girls had been helping him speak up before. As the son of the elder of the Astral Serpent Order and a well-known top figure, he could not watch them being bullied!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Loser, how dare you hit them! And how dare you ignore me!?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Truman took a step forward and exuded his aura. He was attempting to pressure Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What do you think you are to deserve my respect?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus remained fearless and his face didn't even change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bastard, you are looking for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Truman was pissed off the charts as Marcus talked back to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd trembled and didn't expect Marcus to not even care about Truman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They knew that Truman was not only powerful but also had the Astral Serpent Order's support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In their eyes, Marcus was only at Ancient Martial Stage Two, so they wondered why he was so confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, let's just drop it. I'll apologize to Mr. Dupont. Let's leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Truman was involved, Cooke grew worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Marcus' strength was very strong, he was still not a match for Truman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As was known to all, Truman was at the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Three and had the Astral Serpent Order's support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was not someone Marcus could provoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus glanced at Cooke and smiled, "What? Are you scared?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cooke blushed and explained, "Mr. Fitzgerald, I'm just thinking about you. If you want to fight, I won't frown to give you my life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While Cooke was talking, Truman had been coming toward Marcus step by step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His aura rose and he was releasing all the power at the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The space was depressed, and many people present were trembling, and cold sweat appeared on their foreheads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Truman was a true leader among the younger generation of the Astral Serpent Order, and his strength should not be underestimated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Dupont, you can't forgive him!" Camila reminded Truman and looked at Marcus with resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you're looking for death yourself, don't blame me for bullying you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Truman came to Marcus and the destructive force lingered in the palm of his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He then slapped Marcus with a destructive handprint!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The power of this handprint was terrifying. Wherever it went, it lifted up a gust of icy wind as if it was about to destroy everything!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many people looked in horror and involuntarily retreated for fear that they would be affected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get out! Everyone!" Marcus yelled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next moment, Marcus unleashed a light punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This punch seemed to have no power at all, and it collided with Truman's handprint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many people cast a sarcastic look at Marcus and thought he was dead meat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fighting against Truman? He was simply seeking his own death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Accompanied by a terrible shock, their attacks collided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Truman sneered and his expression was filled with arrogance. Killing Marcus required only one move from him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, with the gradual intensification of the attack and collision between the two, Truman's became serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next moment, he only felt a destructive force pass down Marcus' fist to his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This caused him to shake wildly, the bones in his arms to collapse inch by inch, and a powerful impact fell on his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The destructive force blasted Truman away!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hit a nearby rockery fiercely like a cannonball!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A loud bang came. The rockery shattered and turned into ruins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the ruins, Truman made a loud cough sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then the crowd saw a messy figure get up from the ruins. It was none other than Truman!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His clothes were rugged and he was covered with blood. Truman no longer looked as radiant as before and had become extremely disheveled!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How was that possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd trembled with disbelief!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Truman, the son of the elder of the Astral Serpent Order, a leading figure in the younger generation, even couldn't bear a punch from Marcus!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unbelievable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Truman's cultivation seemed to have disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This meant that he had become a useless person!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus used one punch to beat Truman. How strong could Marcus be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You are only at the Ancient Martial Stage Four. How come&hellip;Who are you exactly?" Truman asked in a trembling voice.</span></p></div>
