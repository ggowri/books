  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus soon got accustomed to the inflation in the Southern market and also understood why money depreciated so much here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was very simple. Warriors persuaded superior power, and once they achieved their goal, money would naturally flow to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For those powerful ones, making money was a piece of cake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, resources to boost their power, including energy crystals, were valued more than money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cooke, for instance, handled the Red River Mines with abundant wealth but couldn't even get a pill to improve himself due to his weakness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An ordinary energy crystal would be a great treasure for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, gradually, Marcus no longer felt confused about the different views on money between the Southern Market and the Mundane world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seven days later, Marcus successfully completed the work of a raw crystal appraiser.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vanessa also fulfilled her promise. The total turnover of the Grand Fortune this week reached 6.3 trillion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>According to the forty percent share ratio, Marcus could get a total of 2.52 trillion dollars, which would be a huge sum of money both in the mundane world and the world of Ancient Martial Art!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instead of taking the reward in cash, he asked Vanessa to exchange the money for high-quality energy crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ans Vanessa agreed without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>According to Marcus' requirements, the quality of the energy crystals couldn't be lower than that of the crystals that he used to bet on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>2.52 trillion dollars almost hollowed out her storage of superior energy crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus roughly estimated that the energy crystals he now owned could update at least one thousand and six hundred submachine guns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once it finished, he could form an army of one thousand and six hundred soldiers with advanced energy crystal submachine guns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It would be a horrifying force!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, he would even compete with top domestic Ancient Martial Art organizations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Marcus felt a sense of accomplishment filled his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although the trip to southeast Uswad was full of ups and downs, he finally achieved what he wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He collected enough energy crystals, mastered the Red River Mines, and also made Cooke his partner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And he even got the knowledge of beastmasters from Cooke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as he studied hard, Marcus would probably become one of them in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was definitely a good thing for him to improve his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he had collected enough energy crystals, Marcus said goodbye to Vanessa and left the Southern Market with Cooke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, Vanessa was a little reluctant to let him go. After all, the turnover of the Grand Fortune doubled with Marcus' skill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he promised her that he would come back to purchase more energy crystals from time to time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only one thousand and six hundred energy crystal submachine guns were not his ultimate goal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two brothers he had never met must have handled horrifying power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he couldn't develop himself soon enough, maybe he would be eliminated by them before inheriting the position of Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They came back to the Red River Mines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus ordered Cooke to build roads to connect the mines with the outside world better and paid for legitimate quarrymen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cooke followed his order and immediately hired a local construction company to build roads. Meanwhile, he also put up wanted posters for quarry men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In that case, the Red River Mines would be able to resume the work within a month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although it only produced decorative crystals, the annual turnover would also surprise everyone with enhanced management.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before leaving the mines, Marcus gave Cooke some pills and some books of Ancient Martial Art to facilitate his cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cooke was very grateful to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He took the pills Marcus gave him before and broke through the Ancient Martial Stage Two a few days ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Something he didn't dare to dream about in the past actually came true after meeting Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In addition, Cooke became more loyal to Marcus after witnessing his deterring power and surpassing talent for stone gambling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, can I go to the mainland with you? I want to take care of you from now on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A stunning young lady ran to Marcus as he just got into Cooke's SUV. It was Cooke's daughter, Pearl Ford.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The pearl at the moment, big dark eyes are staring at Tang Long with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cooke said, "Although Pearl is my spoiled daughter and the heiress of the Red River Mines, she is a kind, capable girl. Please take her with you, Mr. Fitzgerald!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Cooke bowed to Marcus.</span></p><div class="pagination">
