  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow and asked, "What was something you never dared to think about before?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie's cheeks turned even redder, and she shot Marcus a glance. "You know exactly what I mean. Why are you pretending not to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had a vague guess. Memories of treating Josie before flashed through his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the time, her expressions were euphoric, her body trembling, and her voice enticing&mdash;it had been clear she was enjoying it immensely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had likely reached a certain peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Marcus feigned ignorance. "What am I pretending about? You're accusing me of something I didn't do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shrugged as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Josie's shy demeanor, Marcus found it incredibly amusing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, he thought she looked stunning, her elegance amplified by the soft glow of the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie bit her lip and finally spoke, her voice barely above a whisper. "I mean... matters between a man and a woman..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her like this, Marcus found her endearing. He hadn't expected a woman in her thirties to be so reserved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was even more bashful than some young girls he had met.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie grew more embarrassed as Marcus smiled at her. "Marcus, stop laughing at me..." she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied, "I'm not laughing at you. I just think you're kind of adorable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie lowered her head, avoiding his gaze. "What's so adorable about that..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching her elegant demeanor, Marcus felt something stir within him. "Your husband's been gone for years now. Have you never thought about finding someone else?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie's beautiful eyes reflected a trace of sadness at his question. It was a topic she didn't want to face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't have to answer if you don't want to," Marcus offered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie hesitated for a moment, then gathered her courage. "Never... but I'm still a normal woman. Sometimes, late at night, I feel empty and lonely. I just haven't found the right person, and I still can't get past my late husband. It feels like I'd be betraying him, so I've stayed single all this time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Josie felt a weight lift from her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a secret she had buried for years, like a heavy stone pressing down on her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie had never imagined she'd share such thoughts with any man other than her late husband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, she regretted speaking, afraid Marcus might mock her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus felt a pang of sympathy as he saw her embarrassment. He patted her shoulder gently and said, "You really don't have to think that way. For all these years, you've honored your promise to your husband, cared for your kids and in-laws, and done your duty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's the greatest respect you could show him. He must have loved you dearly, and he wouldn't want you to keep suffering like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you find happiness, his spirit can finally rest in peace."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie stared at Marcus. She understood his words, but she had been trapped by her own moral constraints for too long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's words gave her a sudden sense of clarity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like a knot in her heart had finally been untied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Love is about holding on, but it's also about letting go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Marcus..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Josie's eyes turned red with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man in front of her grew even more admirable in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus hesitantly pulled Josie into his arms. She flinched at first but didn't resist further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gently stroked Josie's hair, the two of them attuned to each other's heartbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Josie felt as though time had stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been five years since she had felt the warmth of an embrace like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, she was completely lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gazed at the elegant beauty in his arms and couldn't resist leaning in for a kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie's eyes widened in shock. It felt like a jolt of electricity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body trembled violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sweet sensation of their lips meeting coursed through her entire body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus lifted his head, gazed at Josie tenderly, and asked, "Josie, did you like it?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
