  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air was pierced by two terrifying shockwaves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodies of the two 5th-generation cyborgs exploded into nothingness, torn apart without even a shred of resistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their proud defense, more than three times stronger than the 4th-generation cyborgs, was utterly useless against Marcus' fist ray&mdash;the devastating force of his fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the next several minutes, Marcus unleashed a barrage of destructive attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The 5th-generation cyborgs could only block, unable to even think about fighting back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than ten minutes, every last one of them had been annihilated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of this slaughter left the Black Hawk Legion's top leaders pale with shock. They had never anticipated Marcus' strength to be so overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your turn," Marcus sneered, his voice dripping with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a single step forward, and in an instant, Shadow Step activated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His form blurred, scattering into countless afterimages, and within a blink, he appeared before the two highest-ranking members of the Black Hawk Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They froze in terror, panic rising in their chests as they desperately tried to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they were no match for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flick of his wrist, two Firebolts shot out, engulfing the two men in searing flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air filled with their agonized screams, but the fire consumed them quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Less than a minute later, all that remained was ash and smoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two more high-ranking members tried to make a break for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus drew a compact submachine gun and fired two deadly energy beams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two men's heads exploded in violent </span><span>bursts,</span><span> their lives snuffed out in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tension in the air was suffocating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without missing a beat, Marcus shifted his stance, his foot barely touching the ground before he was right in front of another leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His </span><span>fist</span><span> slammed into the man's chest with a deafening crack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force of the blow ripped a massive hole through his torso, and the man crumpled to the ground, dead before he hit the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, every top leader of the Black Hawk Legion&mdash;except for Aquila&mdash;lay dead at his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' cold, piercing gaze locked onto Aquila. "Where is Josie?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was lethal, his mind laser-focused on one thing&mdash;Josie's safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aquila's lips curled into a sinister grin, and he sneered. "You want to know where your girl is? Beat me first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression twisted into something dark and eerie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, Aquila pulled several vials from his pocket, each filled with a different colored serum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he jammed the needles into his abdomen, injecting the strange concoctions into his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus watched in disbelief as Aquila's body began to change before his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His muscles swelled and his bones shifted, cracking and popping as his form grew unnaturally larger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body expanded at a terrifying pace, his veins bulging and his muscles distorting to their limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then, his head... it morphed into something grotesque&mdash;a monstrous dragon-like visage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His jaw unhinged into a massive, gaping maw, revealing rows of razor-sharp teeth that gleamed with an unsettling hunger. It was like staring into the face of a nightmare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mutant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus finally pieced it together&mdash;Aquila wasn't just a normal human.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a mutant, and from the looks of it, a highly advanced one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The changes in his physique weren't just genetic enhancement; they were the result of some twisted experiment. Marcus could see the telltale signs of dragon DNA and other altered genes coursing through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You pathetic fool," Aquila sneered, his voice dripping with venom. "Let's see how long you can last in front of me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, Aquila roared, his voice shaking the very air. Then, he lunged at Marcus, his gargantuan form moving with terrifying speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the sheer size of his body&mdash;over nine feet tall&mdash;he moved with the swiftness of a predator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One massive, clawed hand shot toward Marcus, radiating an aura of dragon-like ferocity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The claws glowed with a blood-red light, tearing through the air as if they were cutting space itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't flinch. His Timeless Warrior's Grimoire flared to life, his </span><span>Thunderfire</span><span> Power crackling around him as he unleashed a devastating punch, meeting Aquila's attack head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The collision was deafening. The shockwave tore through the air, sending waves of destructive force rippling outward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was driven back several steps, his arm going numb from the impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aquila's lips curled into a mocking smile. "I've been augmented with countless cutting-edge research projects," he taunted. "To become the ultimate dragon mutant, I've gone through hell. And now, I'm going to carve you up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Aquila threw back his head and opened his massive mouth wide, releasing a jet of pitch-black flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fire blazed toward Marcus, scorching the air with an overwhelming heat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As it spread, it gave off a nauseating stench&mdash;an acrid, corrosive vapor that seemed to </span><span>eat away at everything in its path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' face tightened with concern. He hadn't expected Aquila's strength to be this terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, he drew his golden scimitar, slashing it through the air with precision. The blade sliced through the space between them, sending out sharp, deadly arcs of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each strike was perfectly aimed, but Aquila barely reacted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy slashes hit his body with a sound like metal on metal&mdash;loud, but ultimately futile. His skin, mutated and reinforced by the strange serums, didn't even flinch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aquila continued his relentless advance, undeterred, and Marcus' attacks seemed to do nothing more than tickle him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperate, Marcus unleashed a barrage of Lightning and Firebolts, each strike aimed at exploiting some weakness. At the same time, he activated his X-ray Vision, scanning Aquila's mutated body for any sign of vulnerability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Aquila remained unfazed, shrugging off the blows with terrifying ease.</span></p><div class="pagination">
