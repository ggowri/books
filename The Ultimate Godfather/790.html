        <h1>Chapter 783 I Want to Go Back-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ice Wall shattered with a deafening crack, and Travis' body was flung into the wreckage, blood pouring from his mouth, his face drained of color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight left everyone present stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had known Travis was no match for Marcus, but they hadn't expected him to be defeated so utterly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus hadn't even lifted a finger. He'd simply released a burst of energy, a casual wave of power that sent Travis hurtling through the air like a ragdoll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap in their strength was beyond anything anyone could have imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact of this was so overwhelming it made Marcus' earlier brutal defeat of Alonzo seem almost trivial by comparison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had Marcus' power increased that much during his time in the underwater world?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was almost too crazy to believe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam's body trembled uncontrollably. He hadn't expected Marcus to finish the fight like this&mdash;not with a show of power so effortless, so devastating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Ada was left in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Marcus had gained strength on his journey, but this? This was something else entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To take down someone at the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Nine without even breaking a sweat? Without a single blow?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was beyond her comprehension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's the power you're so proud of?" Marcus asked coldly, his voice dripping with contempt as his eyes swept over Travis' crumpled form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Travis lay in the rubble of the Ice Wall, blood still oozing from his mouth, his wide eyes locked onto Marcus, filled with disbelief. "How is this possible? How can you...? You don't even have cultivation; how do you have this kind of strength?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't even spare him a second glance. With a dismissive flick of his hand, he turned to Ada. "Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada </span><span>nodded,</span><span> her movements stiff, almost robotic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, Marcus executed his teleportation technique. In an instant, both he and Ada vanished from sight, leaving the crowd to gape in stunned silence, as though they'd never been there at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam and the others had witnessed something similar once before, atop the Divine Mount, an incredible display of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even now, seeing it again, their hearts couldn't help but race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of strength did someone who could control teleportation possess? The thought was almost impossible to grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Travis was equally stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, he might have doubted Marcus' true strength, perhaps thinking Marcus was relying on some external force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after witnessing Marcus use teleportation firsthand, it hit him&mdash;Marcus' power was far beyond anything he could even dream of confronting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcus had wanted him dead, one strike would have been enough. He wouldn't have stood a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the flicker of a moment, Marcus' teleportation brought them both back to a desolate mountain on the outskirts of </span><span>Solomia</span><span>, a remote area in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada once again felt the strange, dizzying sensation of the teleportation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes, wide and filled with admiration, glanced at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you coming with me, or are you going back to the Celestial Arc Order?" Marcus asked, his tone casual but serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, he'd asked Ada if she wanted to be with him, but she had turned him down, saying she had more important duties to attend to and couldn't entertain matters of love just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Ada's gaze flickered, uncertainty flashing across her face for just a second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, her eyes hardened with resolve. "I need to return to the sect. The Celestial Arc Order can't function without me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave a slight nod in acknowledgment, neither surprised nor insistent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you ever need me, just crush this amulet. I'll be there in a minute."</span></p></div>
