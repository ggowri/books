  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, that's not right. The overall consumption level in Kingston is higher than that in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>. So, my monthly commission might actually be more than yours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it's not by a huge margin. The cost of living in Kingston is also higher. In any case, our incomes are more or less on par."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Hadley's words seemed polite, there was a subtle undertone of showing off in them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie naturally noticed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley was her former colleague, and they both worked at the flagship store in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two years ago, at this very time, the manager of the flagship store in Kingston resigned due to immigration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the employees at the flagship store in Kingston were newcomers. Therefore, the brand's senior management made the decision to transfer someone from the flagship store in </span><span>Solomia</span><span> to take on the role of store manager.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two top candidates are Natalie and Hadley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given that Natalie had more remarkable capabilities, the brand's senior management had basically made up their minds to transfer Natalie to the flagship store in Kingston to serve as the store manager.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, later, because Hadley filed a real-name complaint against Natalie, alleging that Natalie had violated regulations during the sales process, Natalie was disqualified from the transfer to Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, Mia was gravely ill. Payne spent his days drinking incessantly, and Edwin was in the midst of his college studies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The family was in financial straits, so this transfer opportunity held great significance for Natalie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, all salespeople would commit her violations to a greater or lesser extent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nevertheless, Hadley exploited this alleged violation and forcefully snatched away Natalie's promotion eligibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They used to be best friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But because of this incident, they completely broke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been two years since they last met.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie's resentment towards Hadley appeared to have lessened somewhat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She asked Hadley, "Is this your boyfriend? He's quite handsome. You are a perfect match."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley glanced at the man next to her affectionately and proudly introduced him, "He is Noel Ortega, a member of the Ortega family in Kingston and Battle God Oliver's cousin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She deliberately mentioned Battle God Oliver in an attempt to emphasize Noel's identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Noel was indeed a member of the Ortega family, but he was from a distant branch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paled in comparison with the members of the Ortega family that Marcus had met before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noel's parents, relying on the reputation of the Ortega family, built a prosperous career and achieved success in Kingston's business realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their current net worth was close to 100 billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley's statement stunned Natalie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had naturally heard of how influential the Ortega family in Kingston was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the number one family in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, despite having only been transferred to Kingston for two years, Hadley managed to find a boyfriend from the Ortega family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie wasn't envious. However, since this chance to go to Kingston had been snatched away from her, she couldn't help but feel a twinge of depression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost at the same time, Hadley fixed her eyes on Marcus beside Natalie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sizing him up, she asked, "Natalie, who is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley knew Natalie very well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always been aware that Natalie had extremely high criteria when it came to choosing a boyfriend and wouldn't be attracted to average men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Consequently, Hadley did not dare to regard Marcus as Natalie's boyfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to her surprise, Natalie replied, "This is my boyfriend, Marcus Fitzgerald, a native of </span><span>Solomia</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley was immediately taken aback and exclaimed, "Natalie, as I recall, you had </span><span>extremely high standards in the past. I never anticipated that after two years, you've changed so significantly and have resorted to making compromises. Has the harshness of reality crushed you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie could clearly detect her sarcasm and couldn't help but explain, "This isn't about making compromises. I'm truly happy with Marcus. He treats me extremely well and is highly capable. I consider it a privilege to have him as my boyfriend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley raised </span><span>her</span><span> </span><span>eyebrows slightly and smiled, "Indeed, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. Since you're fond of him, I won't persuade you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At times, I find myself wondering. If you had been the one to get the opportunity to go to Kingston, would it be you, rather than me, who got to know Noel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sighed and continued, "Unfortunately, time cannot be turned back. I was the one who received this opportunity, and I made the most of it. At present, I earn a monthly salary of nearly 100 thousand dollars and have an outstanding boyfriend like Noel. I'm satisfied with my life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Natalie, we were once the best of friends. There's no need for our relationship to become so strained over this. Now that things are going well for me, you ought to wish me the best, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley's words were somewhat annoying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie couldn't help but frown and grumble, "Well, you've got a point. Of course, I will wish you the best. Everyone has their own different life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You feel delighted to be with Noel, and so am I with Marcus. Let the past be in the past!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie advised politely, "It seems that you came to the night market without having dinner. Would you like to sit down and eat together with us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley shook her head, her eyes revealing vigilance. "No need. Noel dislikes the dirtiness of this place, but I forced him to come here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Furthermore, there is a common adage suggesting that a woman ought to exercise caution around her closest female friends. Thus, I, too, must remain wary."</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
