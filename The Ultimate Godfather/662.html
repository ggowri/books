  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never knew you'd end up associating with someone like this," Marcus said, his gaze cold as it swept over Bob.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though his tone was calm, it sent a shiver down Bob's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald... this was a long time ago. Back then, I was just a low-level member of Serpent's Coil..." Bob stammered, beads of cold sweat forming on his forehead. He kept his head down, not daring to meet Marcus' eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The oppressive aura emanating from Marcus was suffocating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think should be done about this?" Marcus asked Bob.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was genuinely angry today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear gripped Bob's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face showed a trace of determination as he suddenly grabbed a knife from one of his subordinates. Without hesitation, he brought the blade down on his little finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thud, Bob's pinky fell to the ground, blood spurting everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the excruciating pain, Bob's face turned pale, but he clenched his teeth and did not utter a single scream. "Mr. Fitzgerald, I was wrong. This severed finger is my apology to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shocking scene left everyone present trembling in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected that to apologize to Marcus, and Bob would go so far as to cut off his own finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This act alone revealed the extent of Bob's terror toward Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many gasped in disbelief. It was unimaginable that Marcus, once a timid rural boy in high school, had now become someone so powerful that even the head of Solomia's largest underworld gang feared him to this degree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Bob cut off his finger, Marcus' expression remained unchanged. He waved a hand dismissively and said, "</span><span>I</span><span>'ll let it go for today. If it happens again, you'd better bring your head to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Marcus' words, Bob felt as though he'd been granted a reprieve from death. He immediately nodded in gratitude. "Thank you, Mr. Fitzgerald, for sparing my life. I promise to atone for my mistakes and never disappoint you again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Bob turned and directed his gaze toward Jenson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, Jenson was utterly dumbfounded. Overwhelmed by fear and pain, he was on the verge of fainting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Throw him into the sea," Bob ordered coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room filled with the sound of sharp intakes of breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson, who had already lost all four limbs, was still not going to be spared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His ultimate fate was death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson likely never imagined that a simple class reunion would end with him losing his life for offending Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two subordinates immediately obeyed, dragging Jenson out of the private room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although his limbs were severed, Jenson clung to life, struggling and screaming desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Bob showed no mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man who had nearly caused his demise deserved no leniency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian was already paralyzed with fear, her face ashen. She collapsed weakly to the ground, too terrified to even breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrogant words she had said to Marcus earlier now haunted her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear consumed her heart, terrified that she might be next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sean, too, was filled with dread. Earlier, he had made many sarcastic remarks about Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus didn't even glance at them. Instead, he turned to Chad and said, "Chad, if there's nothing else, let's leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chad nodded stiffly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he said, Marcus stepped out of the room, and Chad followed closely behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The classmates left behind were still in a daze, watching Marcus' retreating figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, they finally understood what it meant to be a true powerhouse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chad, satisfied?" Marcus asked as they exited the Golden Hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chad quickly nodded. "Completely satisfied! Marcus, you're incredible. If I'd known how amazing you were, I would've taken care of Jenson long ago!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Chad, this was the best day of his life. The grudge he'd harbored for years was finally resolved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Jenson lose his limbs and get dragged off to a watery grave brought Chad immense satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Vivian, that shameless woman, had tried to reconcile with him earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought nearly made him gag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only had he vented his frustrations, but he had also been appointed as the general manager of Sync Group's sales division for the eastern region, with an annual salary of twenty billion dollars. It was a meteoric rise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Chad hadn't verified it through multiple sources, he might have thought he was dreaming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are you headed? I'll give you a ride," Marcus asked Chad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry about it, Marcus. It's late, and I can just grab a cab. You're tired today and should get some rest," Chad replied with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Marcus nodded at Chad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chad's place was only about a ten-minute drive from the Golden Hotel, so there was no need for unnecessary trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Marcus started his car, the passenger door opened, and Natalie climbed in uninvited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus frowned slightly and asked, "What do you want?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
