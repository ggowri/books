  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of the soul lamps belonged to Asher and caused Phoenix's expression to darken and he rose from his futon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The shattering of the soul lamps signified the deaths of the three individuals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How could this happen? Asher had reached Ancient Martial Stage Five. Who could have killed him?" Phoenix exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Given Asher's strength, few in the world of Ancient Martial Art in Uswad could pose a threat, aside from ancient masters beyond the Foundation Establishment level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Can it have been an external force, a Wizard family, or a powerful metahuman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Phoenix was filled with questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He recalled that Asher had left the Astral Serpent Order the previous day to seek revenge for his son, Truman, and targeted only a junior at the Ancient Martial Stage Four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Asher's two companions should have easily handled the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, Phoenix thought Marcus could not threaten Asher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The only explanation for his death would be a formidable force backing Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This realization deepened Phoenix's concerns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A young man living in the mundane world may be less than twenty-five, and his cultivation had already reached Ancient Martial Stage Four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With such a cultivation, even in the world of Ancient Martial Art, he should be a genius.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such a talent must be supported by a powerful figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Asher tried to go to the mundane world to avenge Truman, Phoenix opposed him. He was afraid of the consequences of angering Marcus' mysterious backing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, with Asher dead, the murderer was likely tied to that very power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the thought of these, Phoenix's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The grim thoughts overshadowed his earlier joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He instructed his subordinates, "Investigate Asher's death in the mundane world, but do not disturb Marcus to avoid alarming him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Morris!" an Astral Serpent Order expert responded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher's death quickly spread throughout the Astral Serpent Order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This news hit Truman, whose cultivation had already been abolished, like a thunderbolt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without cultivation, he was struggling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now that his father was dead, he had no backer in the Astral Serpent Order, and his survival would be challenging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The world of Ancient Martial Art was extremely ruthless, where strength was everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>People without strength were doomed to be eliminated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Little did he know that his father's death was indirectly due to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he hadn't clashed with Marcus in the Southern Market, Asher wouldn't have sought revenge, leading to his own demise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cause and effect were inescapable, shaping the fates of both Asher and Truman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Marcus was unaware of these developments as he returned to the Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana emerged from the villa, startled to see him covered in blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, did you encounter a strong enemy?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus nodded gently and didn't say much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As time went on, he felt that his injury was getting heavier and heavier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hurried to his room, swallowed several healing pills, and began practicing the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire to mend his wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher deserved to be an expert in the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Five, and his attack was too harmful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Using internal vision during his recovery, Marcus discovered that his injuries had affected his organs and major meridians.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, he had masked the injuries by devouring energy from Asher, but they resurfaced with time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus was extremely weak. If he hadn't quickly taken a dozen healing pills, he would have fainted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the pills took effect, he breathed a sigh of relief and managed to use the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Plumes of Numinous Energy, combined with the medicine, spread throughout his body, gradually repairing his injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This process was slow. Marcus spent three days in the room, doing almost nothing and focusing entirely on his healing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After that, he recovered eighty percent of his injuries, while the remaining twenty percent would require more time to mend.</span></p><div class="pagination">
