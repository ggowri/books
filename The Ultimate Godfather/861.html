  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man leading the group had a cigarette dangling from his lips, dressed in a sharp suit but carrying an air of arrogance that made him seem like he didn't take anything too seriously. That man was none other than Aiden, son of the </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span> CEO.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind him stood a group of </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span> executives, all exuding confidence. And why wouldn't they? </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span> was one of the top three pharmaceutical companies in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recently, their newly developed patented drug had been receiving widespread acclaim in the market, praised for its high medical value. The company was making waves across the entire </span><span>Uswad</span><span> pharmaceutical industry yet again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that wasn't the only major development. </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span> had recently undergone a drastic shift&mdash;it had completely severed ties with Kingston's Watson family and was acquired by a mysterious figure known as "Death" for a staggering 150 billion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>MedicaGenix</span><span> had long thrived under the Watson family's influence, and when the family fell from power, most assumed the company would follow suit. But because its new owner was Death, the industry's perception of </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span> had taken a sharp turn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the acquisition was finalized, stock prices for </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span> skyrocketed. Within a single day, the company's market value had already surged back to its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason was simple: Death wasn't an unfamiliar name in </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> business world. Recently, this enigmatic investor had poured over a trillion </span><span>Uswadian</span><span> coins into acquiring Sync Group, </span><span>Eastcomm</span><span> Group, and four other rising enterprises in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not stopping there, he had also taken control of Bayside Petroleum Company and Royal Entertainment&mdash;two industry giants. Every company under Death's ownership had seen their stock prices double, their business booming overnight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, besides </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span>, Death had just dropped another 350 billion </span><span>Uswadian</span><span> coins to acquire Kingston's semiconductor powerhouse, </span><span>SiliconWave</span><span> Technologies. It was clear&mdash;Death had an unfathomable amount of liquid capital, earning him the title of </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> "Cash King".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With such a powerful backer, </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span> immediately became the center of attention in the pharmaceutical world. Some experts even predicted that within three months, </span><span>MedicaGenix's</span><span> business would surpass its peak during the Watson family's reign.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, while the Watson family suffered its worst downfall in history, </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span> had somehow turned its misfortune into an opportunity, rising from the ashes stronger than ever. This was exactly why Aiden carried himself with such arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The party tonight was more than just an ordinary gathering. Representatives from </span><span>Solomia</span><span> Hospital were here, alongside leading surgeons from major hospitals in other </span><span>Uswad</span><span> cities&mdash;all eager to get their hands on </span><span>MedicaGenix's</span><span> revolutionary new drug for clinical use.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the drug was difficult to produce, </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span> had the capability to meet demand if they ramped up production. But Aiden wasn't about to make things that easy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he employed a classic scarcity marketing strategy, making the drug seem even more exclusive and desirable. And, of course, he used this leverage for his own personal gain&mdash;exchanging access to the drug for certain "favors".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just three days, several young female doctors and pharmaceutical reps had already agreed to sleep with him in exchange for supply deals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That success had only emboldened him further. </span><span>So</span><span> when he met Jade from </span><span>Solomia</span><span> Hospital, he immediately set his sights on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But unlike the others, Jade wanted nothing to do with him. She kept her distance, and in her eyes, Aiden could see a hint of pure disdain. That rejection only made him more determined to have her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, seeing Ronald and the other doctors from </span><span>Solomia</span><span> Hospital sprawled on the floor in humiliation, Aiden's brows furrowed in annoyance. His gaze swept over Marcus and Jade before he licked his lips and turned to Marcus. "You did this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah," Marcus replied flatly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden let out a cold chuckle. "They may not be </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span> employees, but they were my guests. Beating them up is as good as slapping me in the face. So, what do you plan to do about it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, amused by Aiden's audacity, couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "I have just acquired </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span> and haven't even appointed a new management team yet. Aiden's father, Finley, may have been the president of </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span>, but at the end of the day, he is just another corporate employee. So where does this brat get the nerve to act like he is </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span> royalty?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaking off the thought, Marcus replied casually, "They tried to force themselves on my girlfriend. They deserved it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden's eyes darkened. He glanced at Jade, then sneered, "What a waste of a beauty. I don't get it&mdash;how did someone like Dr. Kelly end up with a guy like you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved dismissively. "But whatever. I won't hold it against you. You beat up my clients, so you've got to pay the price. I'll make it simple for you&mdash;leave Jade behind and walk away right now, and I'll let this slide. Otherwise, you can imagine the consequences." His voice dripped with menace. Aiden wanted Jade&mdash;badly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people around him smirked, looking at Marcus with disdain. "Mr. Nelson is giving you a golden opportunity here. You should feel honored," someone sneered. "Leave now while you can. If you wait too long, you won't even have the chance to walk away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group behind Aiden erupted into laughter, confident that Marcus wouldn't dare challenge someone as powerful as Aiden. Aiden himself was practically savoring his victory already, counting down the seconds until he could claim Jade as his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before Aiden could even finish counting to one, Marcus swung a brutal punch straight into his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden never saw it coming. Blood instantly gushed from his nose and mouth as he staggered back, screaming in pain, "You son of a bitch! You actually dared to hit me? Do you have a death wish&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, Marcus slapped him across the face, sending him sprawling onto the floor. Aiden clutched his now-swollen cheek, his entire face bruised and purple. "Get him! Beat him to a pulp! I'll take care of the consequences!" Aiden roared at his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lackeys hesitated for a second before charging at Marcus, their expressions murderous. Two of them swung at him first, but Marcus moved faster. With a swift spinning kick, both were sent flying, landing in a heap, unconscious, blood trickling from their mouths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others attacked at once, but Marcus was like a machine, his fists striking with brutal precision. Within five seconds, every single one of Aiden's men was lying on the ground, groaning in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade was stunned by the scene, feeling a deep sense of concern for Marcus. After all, </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span> was one of the top three pharmaceutical companies in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Marcus held significant influence in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>, this was Kingston&mdash;Aiden had the upper hand in every way. Jade couldn't help but worry that Aiden might retaliate against Marcus.</span></p><div class="pagination">
