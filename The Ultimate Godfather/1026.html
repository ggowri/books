  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's your annual salary?" Marcus inquired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Callista seemed to realize something and replied, "My annual salary is half a million dollars, and with some company benefits, my total income each year is around 800 thousand dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded casually and said, "Then I'll raise your annual salary to eight million dollars. When I'm not around, you'll assist Evander in managing Royal Entertainment's daily affairs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This statement caught Callista off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had previously thought Marcus might give her a raise but never imagined he would increase it to eight million dollars in one go!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although eight million dollars couldn't compare to Evander's 50 million dollars, their positions differed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her original salary was only half a million dollars, and increasing it to eight million dollars meant it had multiplied more than ten times!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It brought a pleasant surprise to Callista's pretty face. She had never dreamed she could receive such a substantial </span><span>salary </span><span>increase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps because happiness came too suddenly, Callista didn't know what to say for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief pause, she came to her senses, stood up, and bowed to Marcus. "Thank you, Mr. Fitzgerald. From now on, I will definitely support Mr. Bishop well and properly manage Royal Entertainment's daily affairs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, that's it then. I have other matters to attend to, so you two should go now," said Marcus, dismissing them. He then rose from his seat and slowly walked into the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Marcus' retreating figure, Callista quickly asked, "Mr. Fitzgerald, will you be attending the Luminara Awards tomorrow?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you two keep insisting, I suppose I can drop by," Marcus replied without turning around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Marcus had agreed, Callista and Evander exchanged glances, their faces lighting up with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Callista called out to Marcus, "Then I'll send a car to pick you up tomorrow, Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus shook his head. "No need. Just text me the address, and I'll go there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having received a definite answer, Callista and Evander left Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The night passed uneventfully as Marcus became completely absorbed in his meditation practice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the Luminara Awards ceremony was scheduled for 3:00 PM, Marcus remained immersed in meditation until 1:00 PM, when he finally emerged from his trance-like state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately drove toward the venue of the Luminara Awards, the Golden Hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps because the Golden Hotel was hosting the Luminara Awards today, Marcus encountered heavy traffic, and his journey was constantly interrupted by starts and stops.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he reached the Golden Hotel, it was already 2:30 PM, leaving only half an hour before the Luminara Awards ceremony began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus intended to arrive early.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before leaving the parking garage, he faintly heard a voice coming from nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You little bitch, you're going to give up that Most Popular Female Singer award this time, understand? If you dare talk back to me again, I swear I'll </span><span>deal with</span><span> you here and now. You think I won't?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus followed the sound and spotted a group of men dressed in black surrounding a stunningly beautiful young woman in an elegant evening gown in the corner of the parking lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young woman was exquisitely dressed, her entire presence radiating refinement and grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus immediately recognized her as Chloe Sinclair, one of Uswad Entertainment's "Twelve Rising Stars" and Lila's best friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lately, Chloe's latest hit single, "Midnight Serenade," from her new album, has taken the country by storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had become the hottest track in all of Uswad in recent months.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The familiar melody echoed through streets and alleyways, becoming one of the year's biggest hits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this song, Chloe had once again skyrocketed to fame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This year, the Luminara Awards gathered numerous celebrities from the film, television, and music industries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They would be presenting awards for Best Female Singer, Best Male Singer, Best Actor, and Best Actress, among other categories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under normal circumstances, given Chloe's explosive popularity this year, the Best Female Singer award should have been hers without question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet just before the Luminara Awards ceremony was about to begin, Chloe found herself being threatened by these men.</span></p><div class="pagination">
