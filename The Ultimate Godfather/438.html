  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The statement was met with stunned looks from Tracy, Lucas, Simon, and Tristan. The next second, they broke into mocking laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tracy sneered, "Jane, I've never been to Solomia, but I've heard of the Golden Group. Claiming he's the chairman of Golden Group seems a bit far-fetched, don't you think?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If he really is the Golden Group chairman, would he have time to accompany you here to Sunnyvale? Jane, we're all family here. You don't need to make up such tall tales to save face."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I think Jane's just trying to one-up you with these outrageous claims," Lucas added with a sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But Tristan is indeed exceptional compared to ordinary people. That's why she fabricated that fake position as Golden Group's chairman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She probably said that because she knows we've never been to Solomia." Tristan adjusted his glasses and continued. "From what I understand, Golden Group's chairman is actually a woman with the surname Smith, not a man. Of course, I'm not questioning Jane's word, just stating the facts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I knew it! This pretty boy couldn't possibly be a chairman. How ridiculous!" Tristan's words only made Lucas' laughter even more scornful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His gaze shifted to Simon as he sneered, "So, Jane, you would rather spend your money keeping a pretty boy than sending it back home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I need two million dollars more to start my business. Dad, since you're here today, you need to make Jane hand over the money. Otherwise, she'll let that pretty boy waste it all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane couldn't hold back anymore as her siblings became increasingly unreasonable. "Lucas, you're being ridiculous," she snapped. "Not only do I not have that kind of money, but even if I did, why should I give it to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Because you're my sister, that's why!" Lucas declared self-righteously. "Isn't it natural for sisters to help their brothers?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tracy chimed in, "Yeah, when did you become such a cheapskate? Look at our new house. Tristan paid for all of it, while you haven't sent a single penny home this year. How can you live with yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane's heart bled as she watched her ungrateful siblings. Tears welled up in her eyes as she said, "Tracy, Lucas, how can you say such things? Have you no conscience? All these years, I've consistently sent money home. Even your college tuition&mdash;I was the one who paid for it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now that I'm down on my luck, instead of showing understanding, you're attacking me. I was so wrong about you both."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Shut up," Simon cut her off before she could finish, his gaze turning icy cold. "Jane, as the eldest sister in this family, you should be setting an example for your siblings. How dare you speak to them like that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your brother's business is short two million dollars, yet here you are, driving luxury cars and keeping this sugar baby. Is this how you repay all the years I spent raising you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm ordering you right now. Sell that car immediately and break up with that pretty boy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've already arranged your next marriage. You'll marry Bobby, the mayor's son. The mayor promised a wedding gift of nearly two million dollars, and with the money from selling your car, it should be enough to help Lucas start his business."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment those words left his mouth, Jane's face filled with despair. "Dad, so this is why you were so eager for me to come back for your seventieth birthday? You want me to marry Bobby?" Her voice trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Simon nodded with a smile. "Yes. Bobby might not be the brightest, but his family is wealthy and offers such a generous wedding gift. You're a divorcee, after all. Where else would you find such a good match? I'm thinking of your best interests here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Besides, once your brother's business takes off, he won't forget you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lucas nodded eagerly. "Dad's right. Jane, what's the point of staying with that pretty boy? You're better off marrying Bobby. Being the mayor's son's wife is quite something. With this two million dollars, I promise I'll make a fortune, and you'll benefit from it, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I think Bobby's a good match, too," Tracy chimed in with a smile. "Jane, just go along with it for Lucas' business. Let's be honest. You're not getting any younger. Besides Bobby, you won't find many better options."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sight of her father and siblings' repulsive behavior filled Jane with such rage and despair that she nearly fainted on the spot. "Dad, Lucas, Tracy, how could you do this to me?" she cried. "Bobby is not only an idiot, but he's also violent! He beat his previous wife to death! You're willing to marry me off to someone like that just for money? Do you even care if I live or die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As the eldest, it's your duty to sacrifice for the family," Simon sneered. "Besides, Bobby may be a bit slow, but he's still better than this pretty boy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The mayor will be here soon to make the marriage arrangement. Tomorrow, you'll be Bobby's bride."</span></p><div class="pagination">
