  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Harvey's suggestion, the girls, already a little buzzed, went wild. Even Melina and Judy were all in, agreeing without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Absolutely, being invited to a party at Harvey's villa would carry a certain cachet, a mark of prestige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Troy and Peter couldn't help but give Harvey a thumbs up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These dozen girls were some of the hottest on the Kingston University campus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Harvey had just talked them into a villa party with a few smooth lines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next up? With a few more glasses of wine, these beauties would be eating out of their hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a classic rich-guy playbook: build a personal brand, flash the cash, and throw a party at a high-end villa to show off their effortless charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After those three moves, most girls were practically putty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, I don't want to go. Let's get out of here," Natalia whispered to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gently ruffled her hair. "Don't worry, you've got me. Let's see what they're up to."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, a sharp glint flashed in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He saw right through Harvey and his buddies' little game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally, he wouldn't bother getting involved in this kind of thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after spending some time with them, he realized that Melina, Judy, and the other girls were genuinely fond of Natalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of them were trying to hurt her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were pushing Natalia toward Harvey because they wanted her to climb the social ladder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a friend, Marcus didn't see anything wrong with that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a hell of a lot better than those fake friends who secretly hated your guts and were afraid you'd get rich.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he wasn't about to stand by and watch these girls get played by Harvey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harvey glanced at Natalia and took her silence as a green light. "Since everyone's in, it's settled. I'll have the housekeeper get the supplies ready!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He called Alvin Lane, the housekeeper, his mind already working on the next steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd known Natalia would bring Marcus along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having that eyesore around wasn't ideal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if he didn't let Marcus come, Natalia might not agree to go at all, and then his whole plan would be screwed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd just ignore the country bumpkin for now. Once they got to his villa, he'd have plenty of ways to deal with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as everyone was about to leave, Troy's phone rang. He immediately put a finger to his lips, silencing the room. "</span><span>Shhh</span><span>, it's my dad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone stopped talking, understanding the unspoken rule.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, Dad, I'm at a party with my classmates. What's up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A middle-aged man's voice crackled through the phone. "Mr. Fitzgerald has come to Kingston from Solomia. Tomorrow, you're coming with me to meet Mr. Fitzgerald. Mr. Fitzgerald controls 100% of the shares of Rising Group. My position as president depends on whether Mr. Fitzgerald is satisfied. So, when you meet Mr. Fitzgerald tomorrow, you need to be careful and respectful. You understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Troy's face went serious. "Dad, are you serious? Dea...I mean, Mr. Fitzgerald's really in Kingston?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Troy had been obsessed with Death, who had recently bought four industrial groups in Kingston for 350 billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, hearing from his dad that the guy was in Kingston, Troy was buzzing with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this for real? Let me tell you, based on what I know, Mr. Fitzgerald's identity is way bigger than just buying those four companies in Kingston. This means that if you and I can get in good with Mr. Fitzgerald, we're set for life. You need to take this seriously!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man on the other end of the line continued his instructions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up, Troy was practically vibrating with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harvey, curious, asked, "What's up? Why'd your dad call?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Troy grinned. "Mr. Fitzgerald, the guy I was telling you about last time, he's in Kingston. My dad's taking me to meet him tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter's eyes lit up. "Is that Death who bought those four industrial groups in Kingston for 350 billion dollars a while back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, Melina, Judy, and the other dozen girls were also visibly surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all looked at Troy with a mix of envy and awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Troy waved a hand dismissively at Peter. "Don't go blabbing about it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Death had repeatedly warned his father not to reveal his identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though everyone knew by now that Death was a young guy surnamed Fitzgerald, Troy was still nervous about saying it out loud.</span></p><div class="pagination">
