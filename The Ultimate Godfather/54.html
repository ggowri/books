        <h1>Chapter 53 Who Exactly Are You?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it, Mr. Fitzgerald!" Diana nodded and immediately made a call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haley sneered, his expression full of disdain. "Do you think severing ties with one of the thousands of companies that work with TreatMed Pharmaceuticals will faze me? Stop pretending to be such a big shot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But within five minutes, Haley's phone began to ring. He answered gruffly, "Didn't I say I'm busy? Don't call unless it's urgent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice on the other end was frantic. "Mr. Brown, this is a disaster! Golden Group just terminated all business with us. Our stock price is plummeting, and we've already lost billions. Shareholders are dumping our stocks like crazy. At this rate, we won't last long!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haley froze in place, his phone slipping from his hand and clattering to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You...you're from Golden Group!" Only now did Haley understand the weight of Marcus's earlier words about terminating their contracts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus ignored Haley and shifted his gaze to Emily. "Mrs. Miller, do the gifts I've presented qualify me to be Yvonne's boyfriend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily nodded so vigorously it seemed her head might fall off. Her earlier arrogance was entirely replaced with an ingratiating smile. "Yes, of course, Marcus! From now on, you're Yvonne's boyfriend, and no one can take your place!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus then turned to Charles, who stood frozen in shock. With a calm smile, he said, "Mr. Miller, thank you for your hospitality today. I'll take my leave now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Yvonne. "Yvonne, care to take a walk with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne, still reeling from everything that had transpired, felt like she was dreaming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In response to Marcus's invitation, she mechanically nodded her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for her reply, Marcus confidently took her hand and led her out of the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, Yvonne finally snapped out of her daze. Tilting her head, she looked up at Marcus and asked, "Who exactly are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm a farmer's son," Marcus replied nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't lying. He had been raised by Richard, who was indeed a farmer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph, you're just dodging the question!" Yvonne pouted and turned her face away, looking both annoyed and aggrieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can someone as wealthy as you not have been able to pay the 5 million dollars that day? Don't tell me you approached me with ulterior motives from the start!" Recalling the events of that day, Yvonne couldn't help but feel suspicious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone who could casually bring out priceless antiques, a billion dollars in cash, and inflict massive losses on a pharmaceutical giant with a single phone call couldn't possibly have been unable to pay 5 million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My international bank card couldn't process the payment. I told you that, but you didn't believe me. Instead, you kept calling me a pauper." Marcus shrugged, feigning helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne's face contorted into an awkward smile as if she was about to cry. "I misjudged you. "Thank you for what you did today. If it hadn't been for you, I'd have ended up married to that spoiled brat Haley!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled. "You waived my 5 million dollars repair fee; it was only fair for me to step in. No need to thank me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne's expression shifted to one of guilt. "Actually, fixing the car didn't cost 5 million dollars. I was just so angry at the time that I inflated the price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And today, you spent 1 billion dollars and gave my family all those gifts. If we tally it up, I still owe you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled knowingly, "So, how do you plan to repay me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne's face turned red. "Once Haley's gone, you can just take all those things back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus shook his head. "Once a gift is given, it's not taken back. You'll have to think of another way to repay me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne suddenly grasped his meaning. Her face darkened as she huffed, "Hmph, you said you didn't have any ulterior motives, but now you're exposing yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? You're unwilling?" Marcus arched an eyebrow. "Mrs. Miller herself declared I'm your boyfriend, and no one can replace me. Are you already thinking of going back on her word?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph, who wants to be your girlfriend..." Yvonne's cheeks flushed a deeper red. She turned away, refusing to look at him, and fell silent.</span></p></div>
