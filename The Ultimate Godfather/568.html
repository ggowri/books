  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air was thick with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone froze, stunned, eyes wide in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek, the elder of the Celestial Arc Order, a force to be reckoned with, an Ancient Martial Arts Master at Stage Five&mdash;a figure feared across the </span><span>Solomia</span><span> underground world&mdash;had just been obliterated in an instant by Marcus with a single strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The raw power on display was beyond anything they could have imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake and Baron stood </span><span>paralyzed,</span><span> their faces etched with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they'd decided to bring Marcus in, they had no idea what to expect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had underestimated him. Marcus wasn't just strong; he was beyond anything they could have conceived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luther's prized ally, the one they'd put all their hopes in, was nothing more than an ant in front of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A casual punch and Derek </span><span>was</span><span> reduced to nothing. The gap in strength was so vast, it couldn't be described in words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Celestial Arc Order warriors, once so sure of their dominance, were now frozen, caught in a nightmare they couldn't wake up from.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was Marcus a formidable wizard, but he was also an Ancient Martial Artist of terrifying power&mdash;someone who could wipe out a man like Derek with a single blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chill ran through them. Every instinct screamed to flee, but they were too paralyzed to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus wasn't about to let them escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, Firebolts and lightning tore through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within moments, the Celestial Arc </span><span>Order </span><span>warriors were nothing more than smoldering corpses, killed without mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining Dragon Tiger Hall members were shaking in their boots, their faces pale, and they immediately dropped to their knees, bowing and slamming their heads onto the ground in frantic submission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced over them, his eyes cold, his voice icy. "Tell me, are you willing to submit to Axe Gang?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We swear, we'll do anything, Mr. Fitzgerald! Please, just don't kill us!" They pleaded, their heads knocking against the floor in desperate reverence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terror they felt was raw and palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek's brief attack had already left them shaken&mdash;just the sight of what an Ancient Martial Artist could do was enough to crack their perception of reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what Marcus had just done? It shattered everything they thought they knew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't just power. This was something... otherworldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The kind of power that made gods seem mortal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that power stood right before them. A cold shiver ran down their spines as they realized just how hopeless their situation was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their hearts beat wildly in fear. Resistance? That thought never crossed their minds again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From this day forward, Dragon Tiger Hall no longer exists in Kingston. It is Axe Gang now. All of you will answer to Blake, and you will not dare defy him. If anyone does, I'll make sure you pay the price."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' voice was as cold as ice, cutting through the air with ruthless authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason he spared their lives was simple: these men were nothing but foot soldiers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The real power behind Dragon Tiger Hall was Luther.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These guys followed orders. They didn't think for themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' display of power had shattered any resistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The message was clear: these men had no choice but to follow Blake now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With them on his side, Axe Gang would inherit everything Dragon Tiger Hall had built, instantly becoming Kingston's largest and most powerful gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Blake, do you have the confidence to lead this new Axe Gang?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus turned to him, his gaze steady, giving no room for doubt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake nodded enthusiastically, his heart racing with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just moments ago, he had been staring down death, prepared for the worst.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But everything had changed the instant Marcus walked in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man had single-handedly turned the tide, saving Axe Gang from being wiped out and effortlessly bringing Dragon Tiger Hall to its knees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was power. Pure, unassailable power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the face of that, wealth, status, and influence meant nothing. It was all just smoke and mirrors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Baron, you'll be helping Blake manage Axe Gang. In one month, I want to see results. The underground world of Kingston will be ours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus spoke to Baron next, his tone firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Baron nodded quickly, his mind racing. He knew Marcus had trained Edgar, and Edgar was now an Ancient Martial Artist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That alone made him eager for Marcus to share some of that knowledge with them. He couldn't wait to learn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus reached into his Spatial Ring and pulled out several small, yellowed booklets. He handed them to Blake and Baron.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These are cultivation manuals for training in Ancient Martial Arts. Take them, study them. They'll help you get stronger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The books were priceless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were the spoils of Marcus' many battles&mdash;things he didn't need, but things that could make Axe Gang's power even more formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake and Baron stared at the books like they were treasures, overwhelmed with gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To them, learning the Ancient Martial Arts was more tempting than all the gold in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After seeing what an Ancient Martial Artist could do, their faith in the path ahead was unshakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, in the coming days, I'll be sending over some weapons. Make sure to accept them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus continued, his words carrying weight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The "weapons" he referred to were, of course, the modified firearms Diana had been working on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake and Baron exchanged a confused look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, Axe Gang wasn't the biggest gang in Kingston, but they weren't exactly lacking in weapons.</span></p><div class="pagination">
