  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie's sweet yet slightly bashful voice came through the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Send me the address; I'll head over now," Marcus said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie gave him the address.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lived alone, in a modest apartment complex in Solomia's historic district.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus hailed a cab and arrived at the entrance of the complex, where he spotted Josie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was wrapped in a pale trench coat, her white scarf elegantly tied around her neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, Josie had straightened her hair, her glossy locks swaying gently in the breeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tall, graceful figure and poised demeanor made her a captivating sight, drawing glances from passersby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you waiting out here, Ms. Shelman?" Marcus asked as he approached her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie smiled. "There are too many units in this complex. I was worried you might get lost, so I came down to meet you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She led Marcus into the residential area, aptly named "Sunshine Estates."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The complex was spacious, but its facilities were dated&mdash;not exactly the kind of place you'd expect a successful entrepreneur like Josie to live.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This further reflected her frugal nature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie's apartment was on the fifth floor&mdash;a three-bedroom unit of about 1,600 square feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We bought this place when I got married. I never had the heart to sell it. Now that I live here alone, it's more space than I need, but I haven't moved out," Josie explained. "I hope it's not too plain for you, Marcus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus shook his head. "This is what real life looks like. Why would I mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The apartment, while not extravagant, was cozy and meticulously clean, exuding a warm, homely atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie removed her trench coat, revealing a beige chiffon blouse that hugged her figure, accentuating her graceful curves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't help but admire her, his gaze lingering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie noticed and blushed faintly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you staring at me, Mr. Fitzgerald?" she asked, pouring him a glass of water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With such elegance, who wouldn't want to take a closer look at you, Ms. Shelman?" Marcus replied with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past few days, he had grown increasingly fond of Josie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't know you were such a smooth talker, Mr. Fitzgerald," Josie said shyly, a hint of sweetness surfacing in her tone. "I'm just an ordinary woman, nothing special."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How's your pain? Any discomfort recently?" Marcus asked, steering the conversation to her health.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie's face reddened. "Not at all. The pain is gone, and even the flow has normalized. I think my skin is looking better too. Mr. Fitzgerald, you're amazing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come here. Let me examine you," Marcus said, gesturing for her to come closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though hesitant, Josie walked over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Memories of their last treatment session surfaced, causing her heart to race uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus took her hand and began tracing her pressure points, moving from her arms to her shoulders and up to her neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie felt a tickling, electric sensation coursing through her, making her shiver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, that tickles..." she murmured, her voice tinged with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bear with it. I need to check for any remaining issues. If I find something, I'll fix it right away," Marcus said with a serious expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hands moved lower, resting on her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even through the fabric of her blouse, he could feel the soft, supple texture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald... is this really necessary?" Josie asked, her voice trembling with a mix of shyness and bewilderment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus remained focused, replying evenly, "For women, breast health is just as important as reproductive health. Neglecting issues can lead to complications down the line."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He began palpating carefully, searching for abnormalities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was not about Marcus trying to take advantage of Josie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie had been overworked for years, both physically and mentally exhausted, and it was no surprise she had fallen ill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Josie were to break down, the entire household would collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had a five-year-old daughter and elderly in-laws to care for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was about to return to Solomia, and before leaving, he wanted to solve all of Josie's problems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the clinical nature of his actions, Josie couldn't suppress the warmth spreading through her body. A tingling current seemed to flow wherever Marcus touched, leaving her breathless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus... are we done yet?" she asked, her voice unsteady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't experienced anything like this in so long, and the electric sensation made her heart race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially since her period had just ended, and her desires were particularly strong at this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It won't take long. I've found a lump in your right breast. If it's not treated soon, it could develop into something serious," Marcus said solemnly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie's eyes widened. "A lump? It's been there for years, but it was so small I didn't think much of it. Has it grown?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded. "Yes, it's now about the size of a thumb. You should be able to feel it yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie instinctively reached up and confirmed the presence of a firm mass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus, what should I do?" she asked.</span></p><div class="pagination">
