She not only didn't come over to take a photo but didn't even come to say hello to Mr. Walsh.

I just went to call Chloe and heard it with my own ears."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucy said with certainty, "Lila rejected your invitation because of a bodyguard. She doesn't take you seriously!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other young actresses also spoke up to agree with Lucy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had already noticed that Ross treated Lila differently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Lila was not here, Ross asked people about her several times but</span><span> has</span><span> always been indifferent to other young actresses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They realized Ross cared about Lila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young actresses wanted to take advantage of this opportunity to kick Lila out of the entertainment circle so that they would lose a competitor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone hit a person who was down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe was filled with resentment, but s</span><span>he understood that whether Lila rejected Ross because of Marcus or not, it would anger Ross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Listening to everyone, Ross lost his patience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was nothing Chloe could do to turn things around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Interesting. I want to see who that bodyguard is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Speaking, Ross gave up taking a photo and walked towards Lila and Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others looked at each other and followed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew it would be fun!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus and Lila noticed Ross walking towards them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled, "Ross is here to meet you.
