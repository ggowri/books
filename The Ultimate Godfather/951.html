        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before he could respond, Alistair Ravenshaw, the karaoke bar owner, stepped forward, addressing Maximilian. "Mr. Lockwood, this punk clearly doesn't know his place. He laid hands on Mrs. Lockwood in public. He deserves to be taught a lesson. Let me handle it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Alistair spoke, he waved his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, a group of ten security guards moved in, surrounding Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair had seen his share of hot-headed youths before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew exactly how to handle someone like Marcus&mdash;let the kid think he's tough, then show him the hard way how things really work.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In truth, this kind of young man had nothing but passion, with no real connections.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Stepping up to help Maximilian right now would definitely earn him some serious brownie points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Maximilian was the executive vice president of </span><span>SiliconWave</span><span> Technologies.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair had heard that </span><span>SiliconWave</span><span> Technologies was planning to expand into </span><span>Solomia</span><span> soon.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they set up a branch here, holding business dinners and events at his bar would be a big win for his business.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These were billion-dollar, even trillion-dollar, industry giants.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just a single night of entertainment could rack up hundreds of thousands, even millions, in revenue.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they became regulars, his sales would see a major jump.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With minimal effort and huge returns, Alistair was more than willing to play the game.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, boys, let's go! If he won't kneel and apologize to Mrs. Lockwood, break his legs! Make sure he never walks again!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair didn't mince words, aiming straight for Marcus' downfall.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His threat was sharp, dripping with malice.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd collectively gasped, eyes wide in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one had expected Alistair to jump in and pour gasoline on the fire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If ten bouncers attacked Marcus all at once, even someone as tough as Marcus </span><span>wouldn't stand a chance against that many people.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Especially since these bouncers were armed and all ex-soldiers with real combat training.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Alistair gave the word, the bouncers rushed forward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They swung their batons, the sound of the wood slicing through the air, aiming straight for Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was no holding back&mdash;each strike was meant to injure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If those hits landed, it would cause serious, lasting damage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What they didn't know, however, was how far beyond the ordinary Marcus had already become.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With his strength surpassing that of any normal person, Marcus wasn't even slightly intimidated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a casual flick of his fists, he sent the bouncers crashing to the floor, one by one.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sound of fists meeting flesh echoed through the room&mdash;boom, boom, boom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under Marcus' relentless attack, the bouncers screamed in pain, falling to the ground in quick succession.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In less than two minutes, all of them were on the floor, incapacitated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some had broken bones, others had suffered head injuries so severe that even if they made it to the hospital, they would likely remain in a coma for life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In reality, Marcus' strength at Stage Four of Acquired Return Essence Realm was leagues above the average </span><span>person's</span><span>. A simple release of his aura could crush these men without even trying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this was still a world of ordinary people, and Marcus didn't want to reveal his true abilities and cause panic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even so, seeing Marcus effortlessly take down a dozen armed bouncers in such a short time left everyone in stunned silence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one had expected this unassuming young man to be capable of such power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The entire process was fast, efficient, and brutal. There was no hesitation, no unnecessary movement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bouncers never even got close enough to land a single blow before they were all knocked out cold.</span></p></div>
