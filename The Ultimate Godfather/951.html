"Mr. Lockwood, this punk clearly doesn't know his place. He laid hands on Mrs. Lockwood in public. He deserves to be taught a lesson. Let me handle it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Alistair spoke, he waved his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, a group of ten security guards moved in, surrounding Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair had seen his share of hot-headed youths before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew exactly how to handle someone like Marcus&mdash;let the kid think he's tough, then show him the hard way how things really work.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In truth, this kind of young man had nothing but passion, with no real connections.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Stepping up to help Maximilian right now would definitely earn him some serious brownie points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Maximilian was the executive vice president of </span><span>SiliconWave</span><span> Technologies.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair had heard that </span><span>SiliconWave</span><span> Technologies was planning to expand into </span><span>Solomia</span><span> soon.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they set up a branch here, holding business dinners and events at his bar would be a big win for his business.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These were billion-dollar, even trillion-dollar, industry giants.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just a single night of entertainment could rack up hundreds of thousands, even millions, in revenue.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they became regulars, his sales would see a major jump.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With minimal effort and huge returns, Alistair was more than willing to play the game.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, boys, let's go! If he won't kneel and apologize to Mrs. Lockwood, break his legs! Make sure he never walks again!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair didn't mince words, aiming straight for Marcus' downfall.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His threat was sharp, dripping with malice.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd collectively gasped, eyes wide in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one had expected Alistair to jump in and pour gasoline on the fire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If ten bouncers attacked Marcus all at once, even someone as tough as Marcus </span><span>wouldn't stand a chance against that many people.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Especially since these bouncers were armed and all ex-soldiers with real combat training.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Alistair gave the word, the bouncers rushed forward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They swung their batons, the sound of the wood slicing through the air, aiming straight for Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was no holding back&mdash;each strike was meant to injure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If those hits landed, it would cause serious, lasting damage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What they didn't know, however, was how far beyond the ordinary Marcus had already become.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With his strength surpassing that of any normal person, Marcus wasn't even slightly intimidated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a casual flick of his fists, he sent the bouncers crashing to the floor, one by one.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sound of fists meeting flesh echoed through the room&mdash;boom, boom, boom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under Marcus' relentless attack, the bouncers screamed in pain, falling to the ground in quick succession.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In less than two minutes, all of them were on the floor, incapacitated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some had broken bones, others had suffered head injuries so severe that even if they made it to the hospital, they would likely remain in a coma for life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In reality, Marcus' strength at Stage Four of Acquired Return Essence Realm was leagues above the average </span><span>person's</span><span>. A simple release of his aura could crush these men without even trying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this was still a world of ordinary people, and Marcus didn't want to reveal his true abilities and cause panic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even so, seeing Marcus effortlessly take down a dozen armed bouncers in such a short time left everyone in stunned silence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one had expected this unassuming young man to be capable of such power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The entire process was fast, efficient, and brutal. There was no hesitation, no unnecessary movement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bouncers never even got close enough to land a single blow before they were all knocked out cold.</span></p><div class="pagination">
