  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie and her mother, Mia, got into Marcus' Audi A6 and headed towards Natalie's </span><span>house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This car is really spacious and impressive. It must have cost a lot of money, right?" Mia asked excitedly as she settled into the car, her eyes wide with wonder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, this is an Audi A6. It's a very popular executive sedan here in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>. It probably costs around 400 to 500 thousand dollars," Natalie explained to Mia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mia's face immediately showed surprise when she heard this. "That's not much cheaper than the BMW your aunt drives!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie smiled, "Yeah, my aunt's car is a BMW 5 Series, which is in the same class as Marcus' Audi A6. The price difference isn't that big."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mia looked at Marcus, who was driving, with a bit more excitement. She whispered to Natalie, "So Marcus is not only skilled in medicine, but he's also really rich."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie didn't know how to respond to that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Marcus, a car like the Audi A6 was almost nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Natalie was thinking about how to respond, Marcus, who was driving, said, "Mrs. Vance, this car belongs to the company. I'm just driving it temporarily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Mia showed a hint of disappointment, but she quickly recovered and said with a smile, "It's still fine if it's the </span><span>company's</span><span>. You're young, just in your early twenties, and you'll have plenty of chances to make a lot of money in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And with your abilities, I'm sure you'll do even better. But I hope you won't use the company car for personal things. What if you scratch or damage it? How much would that cost to fix?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Young people should be more practical. We should live within our means and not try to keep up appearances. There's no need to do things that are beyond what we can afford."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mia's words came from a good place, but they made Natalie feel awkward. She quickly tried to clarify, "Mom, even though this car belongs to Marcus' company, he's actually really rich. If he wanted to buy a car worth 400 or 500 thousand dollars, he could easily buy many of them. I swear, I'm not lying."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie seemed to be trying to elevate Marcus' status in front of her mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was something most people did, regardless of gender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trying to get their loved ones to see the best side of their partner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie also had similar ideas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though she could tell her mother already approved of Marcus, Natalie still wanted to emphasize his better qualities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Natalie, Marcus already said the car belongs to the company. Why are you still insisting on saying all that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if Marcus couldn't afford such an expensive car, I still think he's a good person. I support you two being together, so you don't need to explain anything further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We common folks don't need great wealth. As long as we live peacefully and happily, we're already ahead of most people."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as Natalie finished speaking, Mia continued, seemingly having made up her mind about things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Mia, Marcus and Natalie were high school classmates, and the students at that school were from ordinary families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie had even mentioned before that Marcus' family was from the countryside and didn't have better financial conditions than theirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With today's social pressures, how could someone who had just graduated a few years ago possibly afford a car worth 400 or 500 thousand dollars?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Natalie sighed helplessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew her mother's nature very well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once her mother had made up her mind, it was hard to change it in the short term.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie planned to have a more serious conversation with her mother about Marcus in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they got home, Natalie's father, Payne, was there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was still reeking of alcohol and looked as disheveled as usual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But today was a bit better. He knew Mia had been discharged from the hospital, so Payne had come home early and even went to the market to buy some food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie's younger brother, Edwin Vance, was in his room playing video games.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw Natalie and Mia return, he only gave a simple greeting before diving back into his game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Marcus couldn't help but frown slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edwin, only two years younger than Natalie, was about to graduate from university.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He should have been old enough to understand some things by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, when his mother Mia came back from cancer treatment, Edwin didn't even bother to welcome her and was too absorbed in his game to care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear to Marcus that Natalie's family atmosphere was worse than he had imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's this kid? Oh, I remember now. He's the one who gave you a ride home that day. Why is he at our house?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Payne's gaze fell on Marcus, his expression unwelcoming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had said before that his daughter would marry a rich man, and he wouldn't approve unless there was a five-million-dollar wedding gift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Payne's eyes, Marcus was definitely not a rich man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If his daughter ended up with someone like him, it would be the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, Marcus cured Mom's illness. He personally drove us home today after Mom was discharged, so I invited him over to thank him properly!"</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
