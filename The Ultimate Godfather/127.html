  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius scoffed, "A pharmaceutical company worth ten billion dollars can't hold a candle to my uncle's business."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze shifted back to Josie, and he added coldly, "Even if you're the president of BioFusion Pharmaceuticals, you won't be able to stop me from taking down this loser!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Julius dialed Stephen's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sync Group had recently been acquired by Death, and their internal operations were in need of a major overhaul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephen had been swamped with work lately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never had high hopes for Julius and had only been providing him with material support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw it was Julius calling, he barely caught what he said over the noise and simply directed him to contact his secretary instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius didn't care. To him, Stephen's secretary was just as good as Stephen himself, wielding considerable authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Either one would easily handle Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Shelman, it might be best to leave now," the service assistant cautioned Josie in a hushed tone. "Julius is a notorious troublemaker. He's likely to bring in some backup soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius's notoriety was well-known throughout Kingston; everyone had heard of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Josie could respond, Marcus interjected, "Are you Stephen's nephew?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius's expression shifted to one of arrogance. "Since you know my uncle, you still dare to act tough? If you cut off the foot you used to kick me, I might let you go. Otherwise, you're in for a rough time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail smirked, "A loser like you thinks you can talk back to Mr. Julius Andrade just because you're with Josie?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Her company is nothing compared to Mr. Andrade's uncle's empire. You're in big trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Abigail felt a surge of satisfaction and pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since getting involved with Felix, she'd felt overshadowed by Marcus. Even Felix was likely to be killed by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with a wealthy guy like Julius on her side, she finally felt empowered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus shot Abigail a sarcastic look and said, "I can't believe you're still this clueless after all this time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furious, Abigail retorted, "You may think you're hot stuff now, but when Mr. Julius Andrade's people arrive, I'll cut out your tongue and leave you speechless for life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>About ten minutes later, a man with slicked-back hair and glasses strode into the lobby, accompanied by a dozen muscular bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius's face lit up, and he rushed over to greet him. "Jake, you finally made it! Get rid of this loser right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jake's gaze zeroed in on Marcus. Without a moment's hesitation, he barked orders to his men, "He hit Mr. Julius Andrade. Take him down&mdash;hard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguards descended on Marcus, ready to pounce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tension filled the air; everyone knew that with Stephen's secretary in the mix, Marcus was likely facing a grim fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you dare," Marcus said, remaining seated and crossing his legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To everyone's surprise, the bodyguards hesitated, clearly intimidated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Marcus pulled out his phone and called Stephen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, in the presidential suite of the Hilton Hotel, Stephen had been nothing but courteous, always quick to respond to Marcus's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was a little disappointed that he had such an arrogant nephew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Stephen's respectful voice came through, "My lord, what can I do for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have ten minutes to come meet me at the Chaumet counter in Vertex Plaza," Marcus said before hanging up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephen immediately set aside his work and instructed his driver to rush to Vertex Plaza.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they drove, doubts began to creep into his mind. He recalled that Julius had asked him about sending someone to Vertex Plaza not long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Was this all just a coincidence?</span></p><div class="pagination">
