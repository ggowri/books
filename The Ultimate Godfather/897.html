        <h1>Chapter 863 Stop!-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cody spoke with an air of arrogance, appearing determined to follow through with this fight no matter what.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cody, I strongly advise you not to push your luck! Marcus has defeated an </span><span>Eldorian</span><span> cyborg," Maxine warned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And let me tell you something else! When the Black Hawk Legion leaders tried to steal data from the </span><span>Solomia</span><span> center, Marcus single-handedly turned the tide and captured both Abel and Josiah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know you graduated from </span><span>Acoton</span><span> Military Academy and won their combat tournament, but you're no match for Marcus. Save yourself the embarrassment! It's better for everyone this way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine decided to lay all the cards on the table when she saw Cody's eager stance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Cody wouldn't back down unless she revealed Marcus' true combat capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words stunned everyone present. None of them knew Marcus was the one who had captured Josiah and Abel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that was true, it explained how he defeated the </span><span>Eldorian</span><span> cyborg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Maxine meant her warning well, her words struck Cody's nerves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cody had always been fiercely competitive since childhood and hated being looked down upon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being dismissed by a woman he had feelings for made it even more unbearable for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Maxine's words only fueled his anger further instead of calming him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered and said, "Well, what an impressive track record he has. That makes me want to test his skills even more!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While speaking, Cody looked down at Marcus arrogantly and said, "According to Maxine, you seem capable of anything, so if that's true, why aren't you brave enough to fight me? Are you even a real man?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow, giving Cody a dismissive glance before responding, "It's not that I'm afraid to fight you. I find it beneath me because you're not worthy of being my opponent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words sounded arrogant, but they were nothing but the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had reached the status of a Return Essence expert, having achieved Stage Two cultivation in the Acquired State.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cody, at best, was merely an accomplished fighter, nowhere near Marcus' level of mastery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if this guy did catch onto Josiah and Abel's situation, he shouldn't be running his mouth like this! Talk about having a massive ego!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, Counselor Durant graduated top of his class in combat at </span><span>Acoton</span><span> Military Academy, and he could probably hold his own even against </span><span>Eldoria's</span><span> cyborgs! I'd love to see him teach this punk a lesson!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing Marcus' response, the uniformed personnel behind Cody exchanged disapproving glances and began muttering among themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their eyes, Marcus was way too cocky, and in a real fight, Cody would probably come out on top.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was precisely why Marcus had been avoiding a fight with Cody all this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was scared of losing, plain and simple!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no doubt about it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' words instantly ignited Cody's rage like gasoline on fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen here, punk!" Cody growled through gritted teeth. "You're the most arrogant bastard I've ever met, and I'm </span><span>gonna</span><span> make you eat those words!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before anyone could blink, Cody launched a devastating punch straight at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The punch packed enough power to knock out a heavyweight boxer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Cody was a skilled fighter, that punch carried enough force to rival a half-trained warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This raw power had earned him the top spot in </span><span>Acoton</span><span> Military Academy's combat rankings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The uniformed men who had accompanied Cody couldn't hide their surprise at the sheer force of his attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power behind that punch completely blew them away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Counselor Durant is finally showing his stuff! Let's see how this hotshot handles it!"</span></p></div>
