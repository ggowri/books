  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't bother wasting more words with Eamon. "Blake will arrive here in five minutes, and then we can verify whether my words are true or false."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Marcus directly sat down on a sofa, lit a cigarette, and began to smoke comfortably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "It seems that I did not come to the car dealership for nothing today. Besides buying a car for Natalia, I also discovered the management loopholes of the Axe Gang, which I can resolve at the same time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then we will wait for you for 5 minutes. I want to see what kind of tricks you can pull," Eamon said with a sneer, his face full of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kristen, Ronan, Lara, and Selina, while waiting in place, also laughed mockingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than five minutes, a luxurious convoy drove up to the entrance of the car dealership.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone turned their attention to the door and saw a middle-aged man with an extremely strong aura stepping out of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was followed by many subordinates, swiftly walking towards the interior of the car dealership.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing that man, Eamon immediately froze in place, disbelief written all over his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason was simple. The person who came was Blake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Brooks actually came! Could it be that he was really called by this young man? This is absolutely impossible. Mr. Brooks holds a valuable status. How could he possibly listen to such a young man's words?" Eamon thought to himself, but he quickly dismissed that idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Marcus is a completely useless young man. How could he possibly know Blake? Perhaps Blake just happened to come here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Blake walk into the car dealership's hall, Eamon immediately stepped forward to greet him. "Mr. Brooks, what brings you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as soon as Eamon's words fell, Blake slapped him in the face, leaving Eamon dazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon covered the swollen half of his reddened face, feeling wronged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked Blake, "Mr. Brooks, why did you hit me? What did I do wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his eyes, he had not offended Blake in any way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene shocked Kristen, Ronan, Lara, and Selina as well. They did not expect Blake to strike Eamon as soon as he arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who told you to take on a task without permission?" Blake asked coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon's heart sank, and an ominous premonition arose within him. He hurriedly explained, "Mr. Brooks, I was just helping a friend with a problem. It wasn't taking on a task without permission. Please forgive me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Eamon's words fell, Blake kicked him in the stomach, knocking him down to the ground. Eamon cried out in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you ask? I told you before that you must report everything you do to me. You treated my words as mere wind in your ears, didn't you? I must deal with you today." Blake gritted his teeth in anger. While speaking, he continued to punch and kick Eamon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone fell silent, not expecting Blake to explode with such fury as soon as he arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon had once been a prominent figure in Kingston's underworld. Blake gave Eamon no face at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Brooks, I realize my mistake, and I won't dare to do it again. Please forgive me this time." Eamon held his head with both hands, constantly begging for mercy, but he found Blake's actions completely incomprehensible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You listen carefully. If you had only taken a task without permission, I could actually forgive you. But you offended Mr. Fitzgerald. You deserve to die. Even if I flay you alive, it won't ease my hatred," Blake said through gritted teeth, wishing he could skin Eamon alive right then and there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon stood dazed in place, asking, "Mr. Brooks, who is Mr. Fitzgerald?" He had a vague suspicion but did not dare to confirm it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is Mr. Fitzgerald. You are truly ignorant." Blake's gaze fell on Marcus as he introduced him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon, Kristen, Ronan, Lara, and Selina all froze in place. They even thought they had seen it wrong or were experiencing a hallucination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "So, what Marcus said earlier was true. How could this be possible? How could Marcus know Blake? Moreover, Blake seems to hold great respect for Marcus, even beating Eamon because of Marcus. This is simply incredible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before anyone could react, Blake commanded his subordinate next to him, "Cut his limbs. I want him to know the consequences of offending Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Axe Gang's subordinates, upon hearing the order, immediately pinned Eamon to the ground and pulled out their daggers to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon was terrified. He never dreamed he would face such an end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hurriedly said to Blake, "Mr. Brooks, this has nothing to do with me. It was all their fault. The two called me here. I don't know Mr. Fitzgerald. Please spare me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The "two people" he referred to were naturally Kristen and Ronan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kristen and Ronan trembled in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, they finally realized they had caused a huge mess today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kristen and Ronan, with two thuds, knelt directly in front of Blake and pleaded for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronan was particularly humiliated, which sharply contrasted with his previous arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara and Selina were stunned, thinking, "Is this still the proud Ronan from before?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake was so furious that he felt like his chest would explode and certainly would not easily forgive Kristen and Ronan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He instructed the other subordinates, "Chop off all three of their limbs and have them apologize to Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon, Kristen, and Ronan fell into complete despair upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before they could beg for mercy, Blake's men had already taken action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a squelching sound, Eamon's arm was the first to be severed. Blood erupted forth, staining the ground red and making it extremely frightening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next was Kristen. The moment his arm was chopped off, he let out a piercing scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He struggled on the ground, his face turning pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronan begged desperately, even wetting himself in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was just a pampered young guy and had never witnessed such a scene. The smell of urine spread out, causing many to frown and cover their noses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So this is all the courage you have? You even scared yourself to the point of wetting yourself. Are you still a man? Cut off his genitals too, so he has no chance to urinate in public again."</span></p><div class="pagination">
