        <h1>Chapter 47 He's My Boyfriend</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other end of the phone, Michelle's sweet voice came through. However, when she called him, she still sounded a little shy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to purchase a plot of land near Solomia, large enough to build a brand-new facility. Do you have any connections for this?" Marcus went straight to the point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle was a native of Solomia. Her father had previously served as the general manager of Golden Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether it was her network of contacts or her knowledge of the various regions of Solomia, Michelle was far more capable than Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, entrusting this matter to Michelle was the best choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, are you planning to establish a branch company?" Michelle asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not exactly. You'll find out soon enough. The land shouldn't be too remote, not overly expensive, within five billion dollars, and it must be sizable." Marcus outlined his requirements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's an auction at the land exchange office next Wednesday," Michelle said. "They'll be auctioning off a vacant lot near Bayside Avenue. It's spacious, with excellent location advantages, and the starting bid is only one billion dollars. I think it suits your needs perfectly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's eyes lit up. "Then let's go check it out together next Wednesday."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time flew by, and before long, the next morning arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus first drove Natalia to the airport in his Alphard van before hurrying to the agreed meeting point with Yvonne at an intersection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Parking by the roadside, he waited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At just before nine, he received a WhatsApp message from Sweetheart: [Are you here? Don't tell me you bailed on me! My car is a white Bentley Continental. If you're here, hurry and hop in!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus spotted the white Bentley not far ahead, with Yvonne's silhouette faintly visible inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied: [I'm in the Alphard right behind you.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sweetheart responded: [Oh, I see you. So you're a driver, huh? Good. Since you drove, I'd rather you follow my car than ride in mine.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus let out a wry smile. "Why does everyone assume I'm just a driver?" he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two vehicles started up, and Marcus followed Yvonne's Bentley along the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, they arrived at another hilltop villa complex in Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The villas here were no less impressive than those in Anthony's villa complex. In fact, they were even newer with more advanced facilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The security here is strict; outside vehicles aren't allowed. Park your car by the roadside and ride with me into the underground garage," Yvonne said, knocking on Marcus's window as she stepped out of her car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded, parked his Alphard, and got into Yvonne's Bentley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint, captivating fragrance filled the car, catching his attention. Yvonne, dressed in an elegant lady's outfit today, looked entirely different from her streetwear ensemble the day before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know, your outfit today suits your WhatsApp name much better," Marcus commented casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne shot him a glare. "If you don't have anything worthwhile to say, don't force a conversation. Today, you'll be meeting my parents, along with some relatives and friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm warning you. You're just pretending to be my boyfriend, not the real thing. Don't do anything inappropriate, and don't even think about trying to use this as an opportunity to flirt with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded, saying nothing more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suspected that Yvonne was probably using him as a shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The garage was connected directly to the villa courtyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A servant greeted them. "Ms. Miller, the guests have all arrived. Mrs. Miller and Mr. Miller are waiting for you inside. Hand me your things, and I'll take care of them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne casually handed her luggage to a servant, then disdainfully looped her arm through Marcus', leading him towards the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yvonne, you're finally back! Come, have a seat. Your father is cooking personally today!" A graceful woman in her fifties greeted them with a warm smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Yvonne's mother, Emily Miller.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily's gaze naturally fell on Marcus, and her brows furrowed. "And this is..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne glanced at the men seated around the dining table and, raising her voice deliberately, said, "This is my boyfriend, Marcus!"</span></p></div>
