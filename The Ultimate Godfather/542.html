  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the room stood frozen, their eyes wide in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as though they couldn't trust what they were seeing, wondering if they had made a mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dorian rushed over, completely ignoring Edmund. Instead, he turned to face Marcus, offering him deep respect in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was nothing short of a bombshell for everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People couldn't help but rub their eyes, convinced they must be imagining things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Lila, standing behind Marcus, was utterly stunned. Her eyes were full of disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be? Is he really someone important?" she wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund and Tina were also frozen in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund turned to Dorian and asked, "Mr. Ward, the performance just ended. I was about to head to your office to report. Why did you come here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dorian slowly turned to face him. The respectful expression he had worn earlier vanished in an instant, replaced by cold indifference. "I heard you made some changes to the program without permission. You pushed Lila's performance time, which was supposed to be the closing act, and even cut her pay. Is that true?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund's face immediately darkened, and he quickly tried to explain. "Mr. Ward, I made those changes for the sake of the show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lila may be a top star now, but she started out as an internet personality. If we had her as the closing act, it might damage the prestigious image of Sync Group. That's why I decided to make Tina the closing act instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina graduated from a top music academy, has won multiple major awards, and is a better fit for our brand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was thinking of the bigger picture."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Tina couldn't resist raising her chin, looking at Lila with a smug and provocative gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund's eloquence was impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had tried to exploit Lila, and when that didn't work, he twisted the situation into something that sounded righteous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could continue, Dorian interrupted him sharply. "Shut up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When Sync Group signed the contract, we made it clear that Lila would be the closing act. You knew that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And yet, you went behind our backs and changed her performance schedule. This is a blatant violation of Sync Group's wishes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I've decided to withhold all payments for this performance, including the deposit. And from this moment on, we are blacklisting Stellar Entertainment. Sync Group will no longer work with your company on any entertainment projects."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this bombshell, everyone in the room gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected Dorian to make such a drastic decision, and it mirrored exactly what Marcus had predicted earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was becoming clear that Dorian's actions were a direct result of Marcus' influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund and Tina both went pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund gritted his teeth and said, "Mr. Ward, this isn't in line with our contract. We've already invested a large sum into this performance, and now Sync Group is refusing to pay. Are you trying to drive our company into the ground?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dorian responded without hesitation, "I don't care about your investments. You broke the rules first. Sync Group has every right to enforce our terms as the client."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund's face darkened further, and he couldn't hold back. "Mr. Ward, we've worked together at various events, and I thought we had a good relationship. Why are you being so cold all of a sudden? What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dorian took a deep breath and said, "Because you crossed someone you shouldn't have."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund's eyes flickered. He instinctively asked, "Who? Who did I offend? Is it... him?" He pointed at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dorian nodded firmly. "You're not stupid, but in this case, you made a serious mistake. Offending Mr. Fitzgerald is the same as offending Sync Group. Do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone went silent, the air thick with tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could now see that Dorian's actions were all because of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, many of them had dismissed Marcus as just someone trying to get close to Lila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they realized how foolish they had been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone who could make Dorian, the vice president of Sync Group, act with such deference wasn't someone who would waste time chasing after an internet celebrity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila, standing behind Marcus, also felt a wave of regret wash over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but recall everything she had said to Marcus earlier. A deep sense of shame overwhelmed her.</span></p><div class="pagination">
