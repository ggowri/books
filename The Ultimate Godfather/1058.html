  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Marcus' agreement, Chloe smiled happily and planted a quick kiss on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That simple kiss, however, reignited the lust within Marcus. In an instant, he pinned Chloe down and kissed her fervently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm..." Chloe let out a soft moan, trying to push Marcus away by pounding on his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus ignored her resistance. His hand found its way to her breasts. Then, he started kneading and sucking them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, stop... I can't take it anymore. I can't... Enough. If you keep going... I really can't..." Chloe moaned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't give her a chance to resist. He spread her beautiful legs apart and positioned himself at her entrance, thrusting in deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A muffled sound echoed through the room as Marcus filled Chloe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Chloe had been resisting, the intense fullness overwhelmed her senses, pulling her back into the depths of lust. She began to respond, spreading her legs wider and letting Marcus fill her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the sounds of their lovemaking echoed around the room. This time, it lasted for nearly two hours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe had already made the transition from girl to woman, so Marcus felt even more lustful this time. His relentless thrusts drove Chloe to climax seven times before their passion finally subsided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, Marcus released his essence into her, filling her completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was late or the intensity of their lovemaking had exhausted her, Chloe lay down and drifted off to sleep sweetly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the beautiful girl beside him, Marcus felt a strong sense of satisfaction. He realized that as his cultivation advanced, not only did his physical desires increase, but so did his desire to possess different women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that every time he saw a beautiful woman, as long as she wasn't repulsive to him, he wanted to have sex with her. This thought felt incredibly wrong, and he despised himself for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, due to the influence of Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, he couldn't control his desire. All he could do was try to be kind to the women he had been with, ensuring they were protected from harm and satisfied materially to ease his guilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After advancing in his cultivation, Marcus wanted to get some rest. But just as he lay down, a powerful aura swept through the air, locking onto his room instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sensed that this aura came from a Weston Land Wizard, and the mage's level was that of a Demon Fighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not wanting to wake Chloe, Marcus quietly slipped out of her house. Under the cover of night, he leaped into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There, suspended above the clouds, was a breathtaking woman enveloped in waves of magical energy. Her sapphire eyes locked onto Marcus with a predatory gaze. It was Alison!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow, surprised to see Alison again so soon. The last time they met, she had tried to kill him in Acoton but ended up losing her virginity to him instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Alison, who was supposed to be Roger's woman and had saved herself for him, it was a significant blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had assumed that after such a humiliating defeat, Alison wouldn't dare come to him for a long time. Yet here she was, appearing less than half a month later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Marcus could sense that Alison's cultivation had advanced significantly, reaching that of a Level Nine Demon Fighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant that their previous Dual Cultivation had not only broken through her bottleneck but also propelled her to this new height.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing here?" Marcus asked, his eyes scanning Alison's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tonight, Alison wore a short, form-fitting dress that highlighted her alluring body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The top of the dress was so short that Marcus could see the tender skin of her breasts and the deep cleavage it revealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After having sex with Marcus, Alison looked more radiant than before, her skin glowing with a healthy pink hue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm here to kill you!" Alison hissed, her anger flaring at Marcus' lustful gaze. In an instant, a magic aura surrounded her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill me? Do you think you can defeat me?" Marcus sneered, noticing her overconfidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alison chuckled mockingly, her smile tinged with sarcasm. "Maybe I wasn't your match before, but now that I'm a Level Nine Demon Fighter, my strength has improved dramatically. I can definitely take down you shameless pervert!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, the magical energy around her was intensified. She was ready to strike at Marcus immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You might be overestimating yourself. If you're still no match for me, you'll face the same consequences as last time. Have you thought about that?" Marcus' lecherous gaze lingered on Alison's sensitive areas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the few days since their last encounter, Marcus noticed that Alison looked healthier and more enticing, stirring a renewed sense of conquest within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his lecherous gaze, Alison felt sick. "Pervert, you're still as shameless as ever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She spat, her voice dripping with disdain, "I'm not the same person I was in Acoton. You won't stand a chance against me now, so there's no way I'll suffer the same fate. I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alison's words were filled with confidence. In her mind, after becoming a Level Nine Demon Fighter, she was far superior to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, driven by her desire for revenge, Alison rushed to Uswad, determined to kill the pervert who had taken her virginity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alison spoke, her body was enveloped in a terrifying aura of magic energy. It swirled around her, casting her in an ethereal glow that made her appear like a fairy. Against the night sky, she shone brilliantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alison quickly channeled her magic energy and launched a devastating attack at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, her strength had undergone a qualitative leap since she became a Level Nine Demon Fighter. Compared to when she was a Level Seven Demon Fighter, her power was now incomparably greater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This single attack even surpassed the capabilities of a Level Nine Demon Fighter, nearing the realm of a Saint Magician.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alison had no idea that Marcus' strength had increased dramatically since their last encounter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His strength rivaled that of a Stage Five Saint Magician, placing him in the realm of the Innate State Five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Saint Magician was a tier above a Demon Fighter, meaning that despite Alison's advancements, she was still far below Marcus' level.</span></p><div class="pagination">
