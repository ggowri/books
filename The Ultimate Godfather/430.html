        <h1>Chapter 429 Jerry's Despair!</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He collapsed to the ground, utterly drained, his eyes vacant and devoid of life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian, Ramona, and Kiera stood frozen, as if the events unfolding before them were too surreal to grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Until this moment, their impression of Marcus had been that of a man with some wealth, but nothing that could rival what they were witnessing now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus wasn't just a skilled doctor; he was also a formidable fighter, and he casually tossed around sums like ten billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More striking still, both Mr. Orion Webb of the Death Syndicate and Amelia from the City Government treated him with the utmost respect, almost reverence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was hard for them to fathom what kind of identity Marcus could possibly have to command such authority and fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, what should be done with this man?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Director Rollins was taken away, Orion bowed deeply to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was referring, of course, to Jerry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the sound of his name, Jerry's body shook with fear. His strength had left him, and he crawled toward Marcus, repeatedly banging his forehead on the ground. "Mr. Fitzgerald, please, spare me. It's my fault, I was blind&mdash;I deserve this, please..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, Jerry began slapping himself hard, his desperation raw and palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus didn't even glance in Jerry's direction. He turned to Orion and said coolly, "You handle it. I've got business elsewhere."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, he stood up and walked toward his Aston Martin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian, Ramona, and Kiera exchanged glances before heading to their own van.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Orion, understanding Marcus' unspoken instructions, immediately signaled his men to begin their punishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jerry's screams of agony echoed as they rained blows down on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without his uncle's protection, Jerry's empire would crumble swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And with Marcus now involved, it was clear&mdash;Jerry's future was bleak. He was now a marked man, likely already targeted by the Death Syndicate. In a matter of time, he'd lose everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The outcome was grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Devastating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Darian, this van only fits two, right?" Kiera asked as they reached the van.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't that she found the vehicle shabby, but rather that it clearly wasn't built for more than two people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You and Ramona can squeeze in. We're not that far from home," Darian said dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Squeeze? Darian, don't you remember last time? You broke traffic rules and crashed into Mr. Fitzgerald's car. Are you really that careless?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ramona shot Darian a disapproving look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian scratched the back of his head, embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera, sensing the tension, suggested, "Why don't you two go ahead? I'll just take a cab."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian and Ramona nodded, "Yeah, sure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hop in," Marcus' voice called out as the window of his Aston Martin rolled down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera's eyes lit up at the sight of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wasn't a car expert, but the sleek, purple-hued curves of the vehicle were enough to captivate anyone's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Its design was elegant, almost otherworldly. Anyone who laid eyes on it would stop and stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are you waiting for? Get in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus urged again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian, eager to please, added, "Kiera, Mr. Fitzgerald invited you. Go on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Reluctantly, Kiera nodded, feeling a little awkward as she made her way over to the car, pulled open the door, and slid into the plush seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon after, both vehicles&mdash;Marcus' car and Darian's van&mdash;headed toward Sunnybrook Gardens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus intentionally slowed his pace to avoid leaving Darian's van too far behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, thank you for saving my nephew, Cal, and for helping Darian's family,"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera said, turning to Marcus in the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was the first time she'd spoken to him directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus waved off her gratitude. "Darian's someone I care about. Helping him was the right thing to do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The drive from Solomia Hospital to Sunnybrook Gardens took about 30 minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During that time, Marcus and Kiera conversed casually, their connection slowly deepening as they shared contact details.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After dropping Kiera off at Sunnybrook Gardens and exchanging a few polite words with Darian and his wife, Marcus got back in his car and left without going upstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His next stop was Charles' house to check in on Yvonne's health.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After making sure everything was normal, Marcus left, heading back to Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When he entered the villa, he found Diana cleaning the house, dressed in a maid-like outfit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, she was kneeling on the floor, scrubbing away stains, and her curvy hips were the first thing Marcus noticed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her tight pink panties were clearly visible, outlining her figure with stark precision, and the subtle curve of her intimate parts caught his eye. Her legs, smooth and flawless, were a visual contrast to the rest of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus felt a sudden heat rise in his abdomen, and he couldn't help but feel his body's response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He licked his lips, slowly walking over to her, thinking of catching her off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana, sensing his presence, whirled around. "Marcus! What are you doing? You scared me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus grinned, the hunger in his eyes unmistakable, before pouncing on her like a tiger on its prey, knocking her down onto the floor.</span></p></div>
