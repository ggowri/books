        <h1>Chapter 75 Being Awake</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Numinous Energy flowed through Vincent's meridians throughout his body, eventually converging on the heart's aorta.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The congestion in the heart's aorta was cleared little by little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, what are you doing..." Josie was a little confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't know Vincent, but he held his hand strangely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was really unusual that Marcus did not mind at all that Vincent was dying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just feel that I have a connection with this old gentleman. Ms. Shelman, don't think too much about it," Marcus said casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing what he said, Josie didn't care anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was too sad before, so Janet noticed Marcus and asked her, "Josie, is this...your boyfriend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her son had been dead for five years, and Josie had always treated them like their own parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But seeing she was still single and had to deal with everything on her own, the old couple felt distressed and also hoped that Josie could find a new husband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie blushed and hurriedly explained, "Janet, you misunderstood...Mr. Fitzgerald is my client..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Janet was a little disappointed and said, "You have been single for five years. After Vincent dies, I will take charge of resolving your marriage. I don't have many years left to live, and Leia is still young, so I don't want to delay you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie shook her head vigorously. "Janet, please stop talking about this. Vincent's health is more important."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the door of the ICU ward opened, and several doctors walked in. "Five minutes are up, and the patient's family can leave now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus holding Vincent's hand, a doctor frowned and reminded him, "The patient is in critical condition, and you can't touch him casually. Please let go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Marcus was at the critical moment of clearing the heart's aorta and could only ignore the doctor's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His disregard made the doctor a little angry, and he reminded him indifferently, "How can you be like this? You can't afford for anything to happen to the patient. I tell you to let go immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having said that, he wanted to step forward and forcibly stop Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus grabbed the doctor's arm, and his powerful force made the doctor unable to move. "You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just be patient, and give me one more minute." Marcus didn't want to explain, and he just wanted to save Vincent's life, so he couldn't help but increase the intensity of the Numinous Energy's transmission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene made Janet and Josie feel even more abnormal. Why was Marcus so mysterious?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was his purpose in holding Vincent's hand despite all the advice?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are simply a lunatic." The doctor, whose arm was held, felt an abnormal pain in his wrist, and cold sweats broke out on his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the other doctors were about to step forward to stop them, Marcus released Vincent's and the doctor's wrists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry." He gave the doctor an apologetic smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor covered his wrist and became even more angry, saying, "I suspect this man has mental problems. This is the intensive care unit, and the patients are dying. There's no guarantee that he will do something crazy, so I suggest he be expelled from the hospital."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as this was said, the other doctors nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's behavior was indeed abnormal, and one could not help but associate it with some mentally ill patients.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tall doctor, relying on his physique advantage, tried to push Marcus out of the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved his hand and said, "You don't have to drive me away, and I'll go by myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he looked at Josie and said, "Ms. Shelman, I'm really sorry to trouble you. I'll leave first. Here is my contact information, and you can contact me anytime when you are done."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he handed his business card to Josie. She took the card and did not try to persuade him to stay. She also felt that Marcus was a little abnormal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After Marcus left, Janet said to Josie, ""Josie, this young man is weird. If he becomes your boyfriend, I won't agree. Leia</span><span>is still young, and who knows if he will do other weird things?"""</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie explained, "Janet, what are you thinking? He is just a client of mine, and this is our first meeting, and I know him well. If I had known he was like this, I would not have brought him to the hospital."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, while Josie was chatting with Janet, Vincent on the hospital bed actually responded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyelids twitched first, and then his fingers and limbs began to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, grandpa is moving..." she spoke in a baby voice and happily raised her chubby little hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They turned her head subconsciously and found that Vincent's tightly closed eyes miraculously opened at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Josie said, "Janet, Vincent is awake."</span></p></div>
