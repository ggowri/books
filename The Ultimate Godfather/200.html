        <h1>Chapter 199 Malcolm and Ruth's plan</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others envied Maxine's noble status as the lady of a wealthy and prestigious family like the Burnett family and believed that she would live a carefree, luxurious life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But only she was aware of the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since her birth, she had been carrying many missions, and the pressure she bore was simply beyond the imagination of ordinary people!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ladies of a wealthy and prominent family would almost sacrifice their lifelong happiness for the benefit of the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They would finally be reduced to a tool for marriage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine was no exception. She went to Solomia to study alone to escape the marriage arranged for her by her family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maxine, why are you so stubborn? Your sister and I are doing this for your own good. Don't tell us that you like him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In annoyance, Hazel glared at Marcus with undisguised disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine was a wealthy lady, and Hazel was afraid that if she was not careful, someone else would seduce her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, it's my freedom to like whoever I want. I don't want anyone to get involved. Even if Marcus captures my heart, I would rather get your blessings than questions," Maxine emphasized stubbornly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although her last words were metaphorical, for some reason, the mention of Marcus made her heart skip a beat involuntarily and her delicate face flush slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Have I really fallen in love with him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We are just ordinary friends."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus stood in front of Maxine and watched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through some discussions at the scene and conversations between Maxine, Hazel, and Stella, Marcus basically understood the conflict between Maxine and her family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Malcolm and Ruth walked over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maxine, you're finally back. I miss you so much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a warm grin, Malcolm was enthusiastic as a kind elder meeting a younger generation after a long absence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outsiders could not sense his ulterior motives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uncle Malcolm, even so, you shouldn't have sent someone to force me to come back, right? Today is Grandpa's 80th birthday, and I won't run away. I will return anyway. Why did you do that?" Maxine asked with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always been straightforward and brave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm was embarrassed. Then, he smiled brilliantly, "I miss you and want you to come back soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ruth added, "Take it easy, Maxine. We are all a family. How could you use the word 'force'? Today is Matthew's 80th birthday. People from all walks of life in Kingston gathered here. It seems that the Burnett family is not united enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She fixed her eyes on Marcus beside Maxine and asked, "Maxine, I just seemed to have heard you say that you like this guy. You are Mr. Whitman's designated fianc&eacute;e, and the Whitman family will come to the Burnett Villa to propose marriage soon. Who is he? How could he enter here without permission? It's so outrageous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was so loud that it immediately attracted the attention of everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite hoping that Shaun could successfully marry Maxine and complete the deal with Malcolm, Ruth wanted to ruin Maxine and her family before the deal was completed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaun was the son of the Whitman family, one of the four major families in Kingston, on par with the Burnett family, with a profound heritage and strong strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition, with Roger and the Astral Serpent Order on their side, it was a foregone conclusion that Shaun would marry Maxine, and no one could stop it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, even if Ruth exaggerated Maxine's relationship with another man, it would not affect the subsequent results at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ruth believed that Marcus was a man of status, let alone someone who could make a difference!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, she could also take the opportunity to warn Maxine's family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As expected, everyone </span><span>present</span><span> heard Ruth's words. Discussions broke out, and they started gossiping about Marcus and Maxine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hazel's face darkened. She could see through Ruth's tricks. Just as she was about to defend Maxine, a servant pushed Matthew, who was in a wheelchair, over here.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maxine, do you have someone you like?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ruth pointed at Marcus and immediately replied, "Yes! Matthew, look, Maxine likes the guy next to her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew sized Marcus up, and his snow-white brows immediately furrowed. He stared at Maxine and asked, "Maxine, tell me, is what Ruth said true?"</span></p></div>
