  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus</span><span> turned his gaze and asked </span><span>Gertie</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie</span><span> was about to mention her injuries</span><span> when she </span><span>recall</span><span>ed</span><span> the embarrassing and strange reaction she had </span><span>last time. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So </span><span>she swallowed her words back </span><span>and said, </span><span>"I... I'm fine..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus</span><span> naturally noticed </span><span>Gertie</span><span>'s unease. He raised an eyebrow and quickly used his divine sense and X-ray vision to examine </span><span>Gertie</span><span>'s body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was startled to find that </span><span>Gertie</span><span>'s injuries were quite severe, with varying degrees of damage to her internal organs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If not treated promptly, it could likely cause permanent damage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're lying to me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus</span><span> grabbed </span><span>Gertie</span><span>'s wrist and said, "Come on, I'll heal you first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie</span><span> bit her lip and hurriedly said, "Not now, rescuing those girls is more important!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus</span><span> frowned and asked, "Girls? What's going on? Tell me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While driving earlier, he happened to hear on the radio about multiple cases of missing girls. Could it be related to the people outside the </span><span>Ice Wall</span><span>?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie</span><span> took a deep breath and said, "When I clashed with these people, they were about to capture some young girls. From what I know, the recent cases of missing girls in </span><span>Solomia</span><span> are all connected to them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I can't stand watching those young girls </span><span>die</span><span>. </span><span>Marcus</span><span>, </span><span>please</span><span>, can you save them? I really can't bear to see them killed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying this, </span><span>Gertie</span><span>'s eyes turned </span><span>watery</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was clear that this woman was genuinely anxious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then give me a kiss."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus</span><span> joked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie</span><span> took it seriously, stood on tiptoe, and gave </span><span>Marcus</span><span> a light peck on the cheek.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is that okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus</span><span> said, "No, too light. You have to kiss me on the lips."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing </span><span>Marcus</span><span>'s </span><span>rather audacious</span><span> request, </span><span>Gertie</span><span> naturally felt very embarrassed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although she had that kind of relationship with </span><span>Marcus</span><span>, it was always forced. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Except for those few times when this guy teased her to the point of losing control, she had never taken the initiative to make any moves toward </span><span>Marcus</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, just the thought of having to take the initiative to kiss him on the lips made </span><span>Gertie</span><span>'s pretty face blush slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, she was a kind-hearted girl, especially empathetic toward some young girls.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The thought of those young girls </span><span>being</span><span> exploited and drained by these </span><span>monster</span><span>s filled </span><span>Gertie</span><span>'s heart with deep sorrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She could only endure the shame in her heart and gently kissed </span><span>Marcus</span><span> on the lips.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was her first time taking the initiative to kiss </span><span>Marcus</span><span>. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although it was just a light peck, as her impression and attitude toward </span><span>Marcus</span><span> changed, her heart unexpectedly started pounding the moment their lips touched.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That feeling of excitement </span><span>made her felt as if they were</span><span> a couple in love.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as </span><span>Gertie</span><span> was about to pull back her lips, </span><span>Marcus</span><span> suddenly pulled her delicate body into his arms and kissed her passionately!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Woo woo..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie</span><span> struggled hard, but it was completely futile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The heat transmitted from </span><span>Marcus</span><span>'s lips made her feel as if she were electrified, momentarily losing herself, and soft breaths escaped her mouth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she gasped for breath, </span><span>Marcus</span><span>'s tongue took the opportunity to slip directly into </span><span>Gertie</span><span>'s mouth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In that moment, </span><span>Gertie</span><span>'s breathing grew heavier, and she unconsciously began to respond actively.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sensitive cells in her body were awakened at that moment, and a certain part of her body inexplicably reacted, faintly becoming moist.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So fragrant, so sweet..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As their lips parted, </span><span>Marcus</span><span> licked his own lips and said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie</span><span> panted heavily, her face filled with resentment as she said, "You're so bad, how could you do this? Didn't we agree on just a simple kiss?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing </span><span>Gertie</span><span>'s serious expression</span><span>, </span><span>Marcus</span><span> just found it so adorable that he couldn't help but burst into laughter.</span></p><div class="pagination">
