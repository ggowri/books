        <h1>Chapter 19 Take Over</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle felt a heavy weight in her chest as Marcus' sunny smile flashed in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the news broadcast shifted to a drone's-eye view, showing the charred remains of Anthony's estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We interrupt this program for a major news update: Anthony, a senior figure at Golden Group, was murdered last night at his estate. Sources indicate that an explosion rocked the property, followed by gunfire, suggesting a possible shootout. The exact cause of death is still under investigation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail and Felix were left speechless, their faces frozen in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail asked, her voice trembling, "Mr. Yannis, wasn't the target supposed to be Marcus? How did it turn out to be Mr. Wesley? Is the news wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's expression darkened as he frantically pulled out his phone, scrolling through various news sites for confirmation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every headline screamed about Anthony's murder, all fresh news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible? How could Mr. Wesley be dead? Who did this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix slumped back in his chair, a mix of emotions swirling in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald is alive! Thank goodness!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle sighed in relief, a radiant smile breaking across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm doing just fine, and I can't believe you were wishing for my demise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' teasing voice rang out from the doorway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle's head shot up, and she was met with Marcus' handsome face. Flustered, she waved her hands. "No, Mr. Fitzgerald! You misunderstood! I wasn't wishing for you to die; I was just worried because they said you were dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled, patting her shoulder. "I was just joking. No need to panic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze shifted to Felix and Abigail, and his expression turned icy. "You two just don't know when to quit, do you? I've fired you both, yet here you are, causing trouble again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus standing there unharmed forced Felix and Abigail to confront the reality of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix quickly tried to defend himself, saying, "I'm the general manager appointed by Mr. Wesley. Am I in the wrong for being here? Even if Mr. Wesley is dead, the shares are still valid. You have no right to dismiss his orders!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail seized the opportunity, nodding vigorously. "Exactly! Mr. Yannis is right. If Mr. Wesley is gone, Mr. Yannis, as his trusted associate, can inherit his shares. Even you can't just kick out a shareholder!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was hard to believe how absurd Abigail's logic was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, Felix was close to Anthony, but transferring shares wasn't as simple as a casual conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't want to waste time arguing with Abigail. He tossed the share transfer agreement signed by Anthony onto the desk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix smirked, mocking, "What's this? Another piece of junk you found?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened the document, and Anthony's signature, along with a bold red thumbprint, was unmistakably visible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The handwriting was indeed Anthony's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus declared, "Anthony voluntarily transferred 25% of his shares to me. Even if he were alive, he'd have no ties to Golden Group anymore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you, Felix, were fired yesterday. Showing up this morning and causing a scene is seriously disrupting the company's operations!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone, get these two out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The news of Marcus taking over as chairman of Golden Group had spread like wildfire. As soon as he gave the order, the security guards sprang into action without a moment's hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wasted no time grabbing their equipment and swiftly descended upon Felix and Abigail, delivering a brutal thrashing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruised and battered, Felix and Abigail stumbled out of the building, their faces swollen and pained cries echoing behind them as they scurried away like cornered rats escaping a predator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching the spectacle unfold, Michelle couldn't help but stifle a laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As their cries faded into the distance, she glanced up at Marcus, her big eyes reflecting admiration and gratitude. "Mr. Fitzgerald, you saved me once again! Thank you so much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't help but appreciate the mix of innocence and vulnerability in Michelle. "Just call me Marcus. Mr. Fitzgerald makes me sound old," he said with a playful smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle bit her lip, hesitating for a moment before finally managing to say his name. "Mar... Marcus..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right. I won't be in the office for lunch, so come by my office later, will you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He left her with that invitation before walking away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he departed, Michelle felt a strange warmth creeping onto her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Somewhere in her thoughts, an embarrassing image flickered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why is Marcus so eager for me to come to his office? Does he have some kind of special habit?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Michelle's heart began to race, a flurry of emotions swirling within her.</span></p></div>
