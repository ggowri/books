  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing Natalie's words, many people in the store threw sarcastic glances at Marcus, whispering among themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie crossed her arms and, with a mocking smile, continued speaking to Marcus, "Marcus, we're old classmates, so I'm telling you this for your own good. If it were anyone else, they wouldn't even bother to warn you. But I'm being kind, so don't take it the wrong way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to buy jewelry, you're better off trying stores like Golden Halo or Twilight Jewels next door. For a couple thousand, you can buy a gold necklace with a small gram weight. That might be more suitable for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus frowned slightly and looked at Natalie. "I want to buy the Tears of the Angel. Please bring it out for me. If it </span><span>is good</span><span>, I'll pay and leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie paused for a moment, then gave a condescending smile and said, "Marcus, you're not getting it. The Tears of the Angel is 18.88 million, not 1,888. Did you misunderstand something? Do you really think anyone can just walk in and afford this necklace? Come on, stop kidding around. You're disrupting our business here. Do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled faintly, "I don't understand. How do you know I can't afford it? How about this? I'll pay first, then you can go get the necklace. I need it urgently." With that, Marcus pulled out a card and handed it to Natalie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie glanced at it dismissively. "Ha, Marcus, you're getting funnier by the minute. You think there's 18.88 million on this card? I'd never believe it. Since we're old classmates, I'll let you off the hook&mdash;just put that card away and leave the store. If the security sees you causing a scene, I won't be able to stop them from kicking you out. Think it over carefully."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tone was filled with contempt. In her mind, Marcus came from a rural family, the poorest in their class. Back in school, he only had 20 Uswadian coins a week for pocket money&mdash;he couldn't even afford a sausage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie thought, "Now, he's claiming he can buy a necklace worth 18.88 million? There is no way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having worked in this high-end jewelry store for a while, Natalie had seen plenty of wealthy people. But in her eyes, Marcus didn't look, talk, or carry himself like someone who had money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought again, "This is all just a joke. Maybe Marcus is still hung up on our past, trying to get my attention by coming in here. If that was the case, it just made me look down on him even more. This kind of stunt is probably something only someone poor would think of."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Natalie's haughty demeanor, Marcus couldn't help but sneer inwardly. He thought, "It has been seven or eight years since we graduated, and yet Natalie hasn't changed a bit. She is still as arrogant and snobbish as she has been back in school."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Marcus was about to say something, he noticed Natalie's attention shift toward the entrance of the store. A woman draped in luxurious jewels was walking toward them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was slightly overweight, but her outfit, adorned with high-end brands, exuded a powerful air of wealth. As soon as Natalie saw her, her expression transformed from one of disdain and arrogance to one of flattery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly approached her, greeting her with a wide smile, "Mrs. Jenkins, you're here. Please, come right in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was obvious that this woman, Joan Jenkins, was a regular customer of Natalie's. Joan had bought many custom jewelry pieces from Natalie before, each worth a small fortune, which had earned Natalie a nice commission. Naturally, when Joan appeared, Natalie was all smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard your store just got a Tears of the Angel in stock. I came to see it. Is it here?" Joan asked as she walked toward Natalie, barely giving her a glance. She carried the unmistakable aura of a wealthy person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's in stock. Mrs. Jenkins, please, follow me." Natalie's face lit up with joy. The Tears of the Angel, priced at 18.88 million, would earn her at least one hundred thousand Uswadian coins in commission from a single sale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was almost the equivalent of three months' worth of her salary. Needless to say, Natalie was thrilled. And Joan was extremely wealthy&mdash;rumor had it her family was in the oil business, with a deep, powerful background.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie thought, "If Mrs. Jenkins said she wants to buy, it's practically a sure thing. Unlike Marcus, who clearly couldn't afford the necklace but was still trying to act as if he could&mdash;he's utterly irritating."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she led Joan to the counter, she instructed Elena, who had been helping Marcus, to take over for Joan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elena, ever professional, quietly asked Natalie, "Ms. Vance, this gentleman hasn't left yet. He's my client, and I'm not sure if it's appropriate to leave him while I attend to someone else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie's patience snapped, and she turned to Elena, her voice cold. "You saw for yourself, didn't you? That guy is my high school classmate. His family is just a bunch of farmers&mdash;he can't afford anything. Why are you wasting time on him?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
