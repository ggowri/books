It is so comfortable..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina moaned, and her expression was extremely happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She deliberately spread her legs, trying to let Marcus get deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus moved hard, and he could reach the deepest almost every time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Melina roll her eyes and almost fainted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She discovered that after many days, his skill seemed to have improved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this time, she felt much more comfortable than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not that she wasn't comfortable before, but this time, it made her feel completely elated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She just felt that she was the happiest woman in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The feeling transmitted from her body made her unable to stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, yes... like this... That's it... Don't stop... I'm coming..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was enveloped by a huge sense of happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She really wanted Marcus to move faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus naturally met her requirements. After a while, she once again reached a state of extreme joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her entire body trembled as if struck by a current, and a faint orchid fragrance gently filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, her mind went completely blank, as if all her worries had been swept away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This brought Marcus an unprecedented sense of comfort and ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of Dual Cultivation erupted again, surrounding their bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus adjusted his movements, shifting positions continuously from different angles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina responded instinctively, completely immersed in the overwhelming sense of joy and satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps they were too absorbed, as Kari called Melina several times, but she didn't hear it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kari had no choice but to go to her room to look for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Thurman, Ms. Thurman is resting. You'd better not go over..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far down the hallway, Sarah was cleaning while casually reminding Kari.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have something urgent to talk to her about. I called her several times, but she didn't answer. That's why I came here to check." Kari said to Sarah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she continued on her way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Sarah stopped Kari and said, "Mrs. Thurman, Ms. Thurman is really resting. Why don't you come and look for her later?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kari suddenly felt something was wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said to Sarah, "Sarah, are you hiding something from me? Why do you keep stopping me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sarah immediately lowered her head and dared not look at her anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kari glanced at Sarah and went straight to the door of Melina's room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A series of captivating sounds came from her room, causing Kari's hand, which was about to knock on the door, to freeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised an eyebrow slightly and instinctively leaned her ear against the door, trying to listen carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah... Marcus, you make me feel so good. Marcus, please be faster. I'm coming again. Please hurry up..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A series of her cries echoed from within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kari's face instantly flushed a deep red as she quickly realized what was happening inside the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she did not stop them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, a satisfied smile appeared on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound seemed to trigger something deep within Kari, stirring her sensitive emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unbidden, an image of her daughter and Marcus together surfaced in Kari's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This stirred a long-dormant desire within her, a feeling she hadn't experienced in a very long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blushing deeply, she quickly left her room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Returning to her room, Kari found her husband, Davey, engrossed in reviewing documents under the dim light. His focused expression made him seem almost detached from his surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although their daughter was already nineteen, Kari herself was only thirty-nine years old.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had married Davey at the age of twenty and given birth to Melina that same year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By all accounts, thirty-nine was a vibrant age, often associated with heightened passion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Davey's busy schedule meant that their intimacy had dwindled to once every two or three months.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the early years, Kari struggled with the lack of connection and occasionally relied on other means to meet her needs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as time passed, she adjusted to her husband's way and gradually became indifferent to such desires.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet the sounds she had overheard earlier outside her daughter's door seemed to awaken a long-suppressed part of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She walked over to Davey, hugged him from behind, and said, "Honey, guess what I just heard?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with Kari embracing him from behind, Davey remained deeply focused on reviewing his documents, barely acknowledging her presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked casually, "What did you hear?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kari recounted the sounds she had overheard outside their daughter's room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Davey's expression shifted from awkwardness to a wry smile. "You should be happy. It means our daughter is growing up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's more, isn't Mr. Fitzgerald exactly the kind of man the Thurman family would dream of?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kari nodded. "I can tell that my daughter must be very happy..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Davey showed an embarrassed expression and said, "Can you please not invade our daughter's privacy?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
