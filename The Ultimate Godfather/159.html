        <h1>Chapter 158 The International Combat Invitational</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had just stepped into the Solomia Special Police Academy when Maxine, dressed in her police uniform, walked over to greet him. "The combat match is about to start. Let me take you to the arena."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Maxine spoke, a rare smile graced her usually cold and flawless features. She was already stunning, but that smile made her even more captivating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded and followed her toward the arena. Just then, Caleb and a few male cadets approached, teasing him with a smirk, "Well, if it isn't the hero himself. You actually dared to show up? Aren't you afraid Mr. Murphy will teach you a lesson?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seven days ago, Marcus had defeated Edward in the ring. Edward had publicly declared that he would take revenge during the invitational match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To most at the academy, Marcus' victory was seen as a stroke of luck. They believed that Edward had underestimated Marcus, and if the two were to face off again, a well-prepared Edward would crush Marcus without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine frowned slightly, "Marcus is here to watch my match, not to fight Mr. Murphy. Stop stirring up trouble. There won't be a rematch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb and the other cadets exchanged disappointed looks. Caleb chuckled and said, "So, the great hero is scared, huh? Afraid of being humiliated by Mr. Murphy? Honestly, you don't need to feel bad about it. After all, Mr. Murphy is a former national combat champion. Losing to him would be perfectly normal&mdash;no one would blame you." The others nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring them, Marcus gestured for Maxine to keep moving. But before they could leave, Edward appeared, dressed in a black special police training uniform. His voice was brimming with confidence as he addressed Caleb and the group. "I've got a few important matches today. Once I win the championship, I'll personally take this guy down in the ring."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of Maxine with Marcus only reignited Edward's resentment toward him. Maxine's expression darkened as she turned to Edward and snapped, "Mr. Murphy, </span><span>didn't you tell me yesterday that this wouldn't happen? Changing your mind already?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yesterday, Maxine had deliberately sought Edward out to prevent a confrontation with Marcus. Edward had agreed&mdash;or so she thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edward sneered, "This is between men. Stay out of it, little girl." With that, he strode confidently toward the arena, followed closely by Caleb and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine shot Marcus an apologetic look. "Marcus, I'm sorry. I didn't think Edward would go back on his word." He waved it off casually, and the two continued to the competition area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The international combat invitational had garnered significant attention this year, with six countries sending representatives to participate. These nations were </span><span>Uswad</span><span>, Eldoria, </span><span>Bryndale</span><span>, </span><span>Crankhurst</span><span>, </span><span>Acoton</span><span>, and </span><span>Osterwalt</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only were the senior officials from the Solomia Special Police Academy in attendance, but even the mayor of Solomia had come in person to watch the event.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the academy's president, Brenden Wilde, approached with a smile and asked Maxine, "Is this the hero who single-handedly took down two hijackers on the plane?" She then responded with a slight nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brenden, with a golden insignia on his shoulder, carried himself with the imposing dignity of someone in a position of power. Though he was over seventy, his voice was strong and steady. He looked at Marcus with a hint of admiration in his eyes as he said, "I also heard that just a few days ago, you defeated our academy instructor, Edward, in the ring. Truly, heroes emerge young. Why not join me in the VIP section?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine glanced at Marcus. Seeing that he had no objections, she followed Brenden to the seating area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they arrived, Marcus spotted a familiar figure. The man was tall, dressed sharply in a tailored suit, with luscious hair and striking clear eyes. He was deep in conversation with the mayor of Solomia. It was none other than Pete, Michelle's ex-boyfriend from Eldoria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brenden then proceeded to introduce Marcus to the mayor of Solomia and the other academy officials. Upon learning about Marcus' achievements, the mayor and the others were full of praise, each shaking his hand enthusiastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when it was Pete's turn, he refused. "No need for introductions, Mr. Wilde. This person isn't worthy of knowing me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brenden's brows furrowed slightly. "Mr. Hudson, Marcus is an honored guest of our academy. Is there some misunderstanding between you two?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pete sneered, "The Hudson family has always been noble and genteel. How could we possibly have any connection with someone as lowly as this? Mr. Wilde, you must be mistaken."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine, unable to bear Pete's arrogant demeanor any longer, replied icily, "This is </span><span>Uswad</span><span>. There's no distinction of noble or lowly here. I suggest you watch your mouth."</span></p></div>
