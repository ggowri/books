        <h1>Chapter 306 A Peeping Tom</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, the girl should be Robert's daughter, Jade!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Marcus' move quickly caught Jade's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She subconsciously looked at Marcus' mobile phone screen and saw that he had stored Robert's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She frowned, saying, "Did you just sneak a look at my phone and store my dad's phone number? Delete it! "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade's tone was severe!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the carriage was quiet, her words immediately attracted the attention of others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The passengers looked at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus was helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was surprised that Jade misunderstood him and immediately explained, "Miss, I just glanced at your mobile phone by accident, just like you did. I didn't sneak through your phone. Besides, I got Robert's phone number a long time ago."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade said with disgust, "I had the bad luck to run into a peeping maniac. If you don't delete my dad's number, I'll call the police now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, the Internet had developed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>News apps or video platforms often post stories of women being peeped at.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These news could trigger huge social repercussions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a result, similar events could instantly strike a chord with the masses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, many people in the carriage began to talk about this matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In particular, several young girls unceremoniously asked Marcus to delete Robert's cell phone number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus frowned and asked Jade, "How can you be sure that the number is not available before? Do you have any evidence? Everything is based on your side of the story."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus hated self-righteous girls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The girls were naturally arrogant. Because they were beautiful, they thought that every man would like to spy on them and even plot against them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were selfish and paranoid about being persecuted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade was even more angry. Her delicate face was flushed with anger, and she said coldly, "I have seen many people like you. You're using excuses to cover up your own dirty behavior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you know who my dad is? How can you know him? Moreover, I have never heard my dad mention you. This is evidence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her attitude was firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Several other young girls echoed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Right. This man doesn't look like a good person. He must have bad intentions for the lady. He should delete the phone number at once!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The noise soon attracted the attention of the police.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two policemen came over and asked about the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade spoke first, "This man peeped at me. And without my permission, he stored my father's number in his mobile phone. I suspect that he has an evil plan for me. Please help me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her words immediately attracted the attention of two policemen. One policeman asked, "Miss, do you have any evidence?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade said, "He doesn't know my father. How could he have my father's phone number? And I did see him peeking at my mobile phone. A lot of people here can testify to that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Several other young girls expressed their willingness to testify and agreed that Marcus was a peeping Tom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sir, I'm sorry. Give us your phone, please!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A policeman held out his hand to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus was helpless, but he had a clear conscience and handed the phone directly to the police.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The policeman simply looked through Marcus' address book and the phone records of the last month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, he found evidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Robert had called Marcus a month ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had talked for eleven minutes, which showed that they probably knew each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Miss, look at the communication record, which happened more than a month ago. This gentleman had your father's phone number more than a month ago, so your charges don't stick. Sorry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then the policeman showed Jade Marcus' phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade couldn't believe it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She murmured, "No way... How did he know my dad?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, there was a groan of pain in the carriage.</span></p></div>
