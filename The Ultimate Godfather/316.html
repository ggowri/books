  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because the Numinous Energy of Asher was too surging, Marcus' meridians had already been completely filled, and the full Numinous Energy had spread into his whole body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, Marcus chose to refine it at the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, the Numinous Energy could have backfired and caused serious damage to his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus dared not try so hard, refining it slowly and carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although the whole process appeared to have minor hiccups, he ultimately succeeded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It took him a total of five hours to completely refine all the energy and integrate it into his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, his cultivation successfully broke through to the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Four, just one step away from Stage Five!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This devouring power was indeed abnormal. According to Marcus' previous prediction, it would take at least two months to break through from Ancient Martial Stage Four's success to Ancient Martial Stage Four's peak, even if he kept practicing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, after devouring the cultivation of Asher, he had directly completed the breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was definitely a good thing for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After advanced cultivation, his strength had made remarkable progress, his physical quality had improved in all aspects, and his combat power had become more powerful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he were to fight against Asher now, he would never be as embarrassed as he was some time ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even he thought that with his current strength, he believed he could stand toe-to-toe with Asher!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After doing all this, Marcus retrieved all the items stored in the Spatial Ring of Asher and the two experts at Ancient Martial Stage Four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a big shot of one of the three Ancient Martial Art Sects in Uswad, Asher's wealth completely stunned Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Pills, energy crystals, cultivation manuals, and weapons were all available. Not only were they abundant in quantity, but their quality also far surpassed any previous spoils Marcus had obtained!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among the treasures, a manual titled Heavenly Circle Diagram caught Marcus' eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When he fought against Asher, the opponent used the rune method many times and tried to restrain him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, Marcus knew that the Elder Dupont might be a Rune Crafter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Four Symbols Circle Asher arranged was powerful, and it was still fresh in Marcus' memory until now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And after discovering this manual, Marcus completely confirmed this point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He simply looked through the Heavenly Circle Diagram, which recorded the introductory knowledge of circle cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were also many records of rune arrangement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus found the arrangement method of Four Symbols Circle on page 23, which was extremely mysterious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Marcus hadn't seen the corresponding introduction of runes in Timeless Warrior's Grimoire before, he probably couldn't have understood the contents of the Heavenly Circle Diagram.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To Marcus' surprise, the cultivation resources of Asher stunned him, but the cash was pitiful for people of his identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Less than 100 billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such an amount paled in comparison to the fortunes of some mundane-world tycoons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Asher was the expert at the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Five. If he wanted more money, there were too many ways to earn it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This showed that the higher the cultivation level, the less the demand for money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Asher's two subordinates, both in Stage Four, had a combined cash total of over three hundred billion, far more than their master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the cultivation resources were far less than those of Asher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Generally speaking, the battle a few days ago once again brought great wealth to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In addition to money, cultivation resources were enough for him to use for quite a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nowadays, the pills in the Spatial Ring were faintly useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Energy crystal could be handed over to Diana to transform more guns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for the cultivation manuals and weapons, Marcus was going to distribute them to his own people, which would help them improve their personal strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, at the Triumph Hotel's banquet hall in Solariae, an entirely different scene was unfolding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A high-end cocktail party was in full swing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mike was drinking with some high-class people in Solariae.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon was also here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This world-renowned medical professor, after arriving in Solariae, was received by a group of high-class people in Solariae in the highest standard form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wine is an indispensable part of your Uswadian culture. I also like drinking in Acoton. Come on, let's have a toast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mike gulped down the wine in his glass, which was the third glass of wine he had drunk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His vision started to blur and his head was spinning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, Mike's body began trembling wildly. His vision went black, and he collapsed to the floor with a heavy thud!</span></p><div class="pagination">
