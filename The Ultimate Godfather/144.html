  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sight of those people, Philip almost sobered up and pleaded, "Stanley, I don't have that much money. Can you give me a few days? I will pay you back upon winning..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley kicked him in the abdomen and said ferociously, "Fuck you! I believed you and didn't ask you for the debt until now. How dare you tell me you'll pay me back in a few days?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You lost 300 thousand dollars to me, and you didn't pay it back for three months. Moreover, the monthly interest is 100 thousand dollars. Now, you have to give me 600 thousand dollars in total, or I will cut off three of your fingers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The burly men behind Stanley pushed Philip onto the table and beat him violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip wailed in pain with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though ruthless, he was still Catherine's father after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine softened, stepped forward, and said, "Stanley, my sales commission for this month hasn't been paid yet. I'll return the 600 thousand dollars my dad owes you when I receive the sales commission!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley glanced at her curvy figure lustfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of sales commission could be as high as 600 thousand dollars?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of responding to her words, he looked at Philip and said, "Philip, I am surprised that a slovenly and ugly man like you actually has such a pretty daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay if you can't pay me back. If you let me sleep with your daughter for a month, I'll waive your debt!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip seemed to have a conscience. He knew Stanley very well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was addicted to pornography, gambling, and drugs, as well as perverted things that were unacceptable for ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Philip gave Catherine to him, she would be doomed. "Stanley, my daughter has a boyfriend. Please don't make such jokes. She just promised to pay off the debt after receiving the sales commission."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley slapped Philip in the face and roared, "How dare you! I'm giving you a chance. Don't you understand? Despite her good looks, your daughter is not worth 600 thousand dollars for sleeping with me for just a month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop fooling me with the sales commissions. Is your daughter selling aircraft carriers? How can she get 600 thousand dollars a month? No one will believe that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine bit her lip and said, "Stanley, I sold a villa last month and got a commission of one million dollars. It will be paid in a few days. Please give me a few more days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because her commission last month was too high, the salary payment procedure was rather complicated, and she had to wait until the end of the month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, the commission from selling the villa to Marcus had not yet been received.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley glanced at her again, especially at her full breasts, and then at Thomas, who was not far away, and asked, "Are you her boyfriend? You should pay me back the 600 thousand dollars for them, or I will fuck her now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Thomas and his men entered, Thomas didn't dare to speak, and his face turned pale with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was just an ordinary doctor, very afraid of the underworld.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although his parents were both civil servants, 600 thousand dollars was not a small sum of money for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So he said, "Stanley, you misunderstood. I am not her boyfriend, but her classmate. This matter has nothing to do with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A helping hand in times of need, rather than icing on the cake, could mean a lot in relationships.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, it was the most difficult time for Catherine's family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas chose to escape. In other words, he was just someone who could add icing on the cake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite having no right to ask him for help, Catherine felt uncomfortable when he hurriedly distanced himself from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at that moment, Marcus, who had been silent, asked, "How much money did he lose to you before?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley's eyes fell on him, and he replied, "Three hundred thousand dollars. What's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said, "In that case, I will just pay you back 300 thousand dollars. As for 300 thousand dollars in interest for three months, it is usury and illegal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley was stunned that Marcus showed no fear at all when facing them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered, "Who the hell are you? How dare you interfere with my business? He must pay it back with interest. I want 600 thousand dollars, not a penny less. Otherwise, let his daughter accompany me for a month. It's non-negotiable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked, "What if I only give you 300 thousand dollars?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stanley was dumbfounded. Then, he chuckled, "You are so bold that you dare to bargain with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised the machete, waved it in front of Marcus, and warned, "You can return me 300 thousand dollars, but my machete won't agree!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus also laughed, "Do you mean violence has the final say?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
