  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was going to give you a chance to leave, but it looks like there's no need for that anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By tomorrow, the Tucker family will be erased from the world of Ancient Martial Art."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus spoke, his aura exploded outward, saturating the air with a crushing pressure. The space around them seemed to warp under the weight of his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kid, you dare act so cocky in front of the Tucker family? You're looking to die!" One of the Tucker family's Four Guardians hissed, his voice dripping with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Marcus released his energy, one of the Four Guardians shot forward with a powerful, devastating attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It carried a golden aura, crackling with destructive force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air around them seemed to tear apart as the attack came rushing toward him, like a thousand blades slicing through space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire area was filled with a blinding, suffocating light, the sheer force of the attack enough to shake the very heavens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For any normal expert at Ancient Martial Stage Nine, this would have been an attack they couldn't possibly survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus didn't flinch. He raised a hand, casual and unfazed, and reached out toward the attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hand might have seemed simple, but it was packed with the power to destroy everything in its path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the golden energy shattered, crumbling to nothing as if it had never been there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Four Guardians froze, their faces drained of color. They hadn't expected the assault to be obliterated so effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the Four Guardians attempted to dodge, but it was already too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' hand smashed through the remaining defenses, grabbing him by the throat with terrifying speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sudden, crushing pressure filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Guardian gasped for breath, his body writhing in panic, but it was pointless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sickening crack, Marcus' grip tightened, snapping his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Guardian's eyes bulged with shock and horror as his life faded away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't believe the strength this young man had. It was like something out of a nightmare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Yasser stood frozen, a look of disbelief on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other three Guardians didn't hesitate. They came together and combined their powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wood, water, and fire energy surged toward Marcus in a single, coordinated strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The space around them flickered with the destructive energy of their combined attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The world seemed to collapse around them, as if the entire environment was trying to consume Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kid, I admit I underestimated you. But no matter how strong you are, you won't survive the combined might of the Three Guardians.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They can counter anyone below the Return Essence stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their full strength can even rival an expert at the Return Essence stage. Let's see how you deal with that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser's voice was filled with smug certainty, confident that the Three Guardians could handle anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, let's see about that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, remained unconcerned. He stood there, completely unbothered by their attack as it rushed toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the final moment, just before the attack reached him, Marcus simply threw a punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Fist Ray was unstoppable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the combined attack of the Three Guardians shattered into nothingness, wiped out without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' fist continued forward, and in the blink of an eye, it was upon the Three Guardians.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces were a mask of horror and disbelief as they realized what had just happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their combined might, which should have been enough to crush any opponent below the Return Essence stage, was completely destroyed by a single, casual punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of them could even begin to comprehend the level of power Marcus possessed.</span></p><div class="pagination">
