  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved his hands at these people, claiming that he was not a professional racing driver, so there was no need to sign.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those people looked disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, they were also very grateful to be able to witness the style of Driving God.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially since they had competed with the God of Cars, this was something worth bragging about for the rest of their life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You drive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After everyone left, Marcus handed the car keys to Melina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina blinked and kept staring at Marcus, saying, "Just drive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to sit in the car driven by the God of Cars for a while longer, is that </span><span>not</span><span> okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina gave a sweet smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' driving skills completely conquered her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Melina had thought before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She liked people who kept a low profile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' driving skills were even better than Edison's, but he never showed off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in the eyes of outsiders, Marcus was just a guy who couldn't drive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they never expected that Marcus would make such a stunning achievement with just a casual move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a man was so attractive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Combined with the various shocks Marcus had given Melina </span><span>before,</span><span> she developed an even stronger admiration for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this feeling of admiration gradually transformed into emotion over time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Melina say this, Marcus couldn't refuse, so he started the car and drove away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Driving to a secluded place, Melina looked at Marcus and said, "Mr. Fitzgerald, can you stop the car for a while?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to stay in the car with you for a while."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina looked at Marcus, and her voice was extremely soft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had no choice but to drive the car to the side of the road and stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's so good about staying in this remote place?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't quite understand what she meant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just want to stay with you for a while longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina showed a coquettish expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she stared at Marcus with his big eyes and asked, "Mr. Fitzgerald, what do you think of me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied casually, "Very good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can I be your girlfriend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina asked with her head down, fiddling with the corner of her clothes with her delicate hands, seeming very shy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was speechless. It was the first time that a girl confessed her love to him so directly, and he found it difficult to answer for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think I'm ugly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Marcus didn't speak for a long time, Melina continued to ask, her voice a little anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She seemed to be eager to get Marcus' answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, you are very beautiful and I like your appearance, but..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus shook his head and didn't finish his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just tell me why. If I did something wrong, I will correct it. I promise to make you satisfied!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina clenched her fists, looking as if she was cheering herself up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just that I don't seem to be the right match for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus answered somewhat helplessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina refused to give in but leaned towards Marcus, saying, "Mr. Fitzgerald, although I have known you for a relatively short time, ever since you saved me that day, I have been missing you like crazy. Whether I am sleeping, eating, or doing anything else, you are always on my mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today you stood up for me again, and I know that I can only belong to you in this life, and I will never touch other men again, so you have to be responsible for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she said that, Melina kissed Marcus on the cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked at the beautiful young girl in front of him and said, "There are many women around me. Can you accept it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to persuade Melina to give up in this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, young girls all yearned for true love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Few people were comfortable sharing their love with others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing what Marcus said, Melina was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't say anything for a long time but stared at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This lasted for about a minute. She seemed to have made up her mind and said with a firm gaze, "It's normal for a man as outstanding as you to have many women around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Shelman should be one of them, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus did not hide anything and nodded lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since they can accept it, why can't I? I like you, and I hope you can accept my love!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina had a face full of affection. At this moment, she blushed, and she looked even more elegant and charming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she finished her words, she kissed Marcus' mouth!</span></p><div class="pagination">
