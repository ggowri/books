  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chad seemed to be worried that Marcus might misunderstand, so he quickly added, "I don't need much, just enough to make more than when I was delivering takeout."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow, his voice teasing, "Is that really all you aim for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tapped Chad lightly on the head, a smirk playing on his lips. "Alright, let's set your base salary at 20 million. And on top of that, you'll get 20% of the company's annual profits."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words hung in the air, and the room fell into stunned silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For most people, 20 million was a fortune they'd never see in their entire life and that was just the base salary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sync Group was a giant worth hundreds of billions. Even though this particular branch only covered the East region, its yearly sales were well into the billions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty percent of that was 20 billion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chad would get 20 billion a year just in commissions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he'd have an entire professional team handling everything for him. Managing this company was basically like picking up money off the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast, even the highest-paid executives at Uswad's most prestigious companies made maybe 60 to 70 million annually, and with bonuses, they could hope for a couple hundred million at most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But here was Marcus, throwing around numbers like 20 million and 20 billion like it was no big deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others in the room were still processing the news. It was as though they had been struck by lightning, their minds spinning. It took them several moments to snap back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chad, wide-eyed, stuttered, "Marcus... you're really telling me I can make that much?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course," Marcus said with a grin, "didn't I tell you yesterday? Just follow my lead, and everything will be yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To someone like Chad, 20 billion was almost an incomprehensible sum, but to Marcus, it was practically pocket change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson, Vivian, Sean, and Natalie were all left completely dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The poor, mocked delivery guy they had once looked down on had just skyrocketed to billionaire status in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the most successful business tycoons among them couldn't even dream of making that kind of money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson, during his peak years, barely made more than a few billion a year, and those tens of billions he had bragged about didn't even come close to what Chad would now be pulling in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian, still processing the shock, felt a pang of regret she could barely suppress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason she had cheated on Jenson and left Chad was because she had never seen any potential in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had thought Chad was just an honest, loyal guy, someone too cautious to ever make a big move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now she realized that cautiousness had been his strength, and it had changed everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the weight of her mistake hit her, a wave of guilt crashed over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And to make matters worse, Jenson had nothing left and might end up in jail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With him, she had no future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without thinking, she suddenly stood up and walked over to him, her arrogance replaced by desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chad," she said softly, almost pleading. "I was wrong. I know I hurt you... But you were always the one who treated me the best. I'm sorry. I know you still love me, don't you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She reached out and hugged him. "If you have me back, I'll spend the rest of my life with you. Only you. Please, give me another chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chad, disgusted, shoved her away without hesitation. His voice was icy cold. "You think I'd take you back after everything you've done? Don't make me laugh. You called me a poor loser, and now that I've made it, you want back in? Dream on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian, still clinging to some hope, dropped to her knees and grabbed Chad's legs, sobbing uncontrollably. "I know I was wrong! Please, I'll do anything. Just give me one more chance. I'll change. I'll be whatever you want, as long as you let me be with you again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chad, his patience finally gone, kicked her away, his voice filled with scorn. "Vivian, I told you the moment you betrayed me, it was over. You're a woman with no loyalty, no honor. Even if I never marry anyone else, I'll never look at you again. Go back to Jenson. He's the one you deserve."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian collapsed onto the floor, sobbing bitterly. Her tears mixed with the sting of regret, and as she lay there, her heart felt empty, hollow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But deep down, she knew she had no one to blame but herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Jenson's angry voice cut through the silence. "Marcus, Chad, fuck you both. You two have taken everything from me! No one's leaving here today!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
