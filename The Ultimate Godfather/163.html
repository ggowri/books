  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pete thought, amused, "He's lost it. This guy is absolutely crazy. Challenging Gibson? He has no idea how out of his depth he is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Benjamin and Maxine shot Marcus odd looks. Edward hadn't stood a chance against Gibson&mdash;his limbs were broken in mere moments. Although Marcus had impressive wrestling skills, there was no way he could take down Gibson. Maxine instinctively moved to stop Marcus, but he gave her a calm, reassuring glance that froze her in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pete sneered at Marcus, his expression dripping with mockery, "You? Challenge Gibson? Did you hit your head or something? Just because you've got some strength doesn't mean you can compare to Eldoria's finest. Don't say I didn't warn you&mdash;if you </span><span>go up against Gibson, he'll twist your head off in one move." To Pete, Marcus' actions were nothing short of suicidal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a distance, Alyssa's mocking voice chimed in, "Since he's so eager to throw his life away, Mr. Hudson, why stop him? Adults need to pay the price for their choices, don't they?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always found Marcus insufferable. Now, his arrogance only amplified her disdain. She was practically itching to watch Gibson crush him in the ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus ignored Alyssa entirely and fixed his gaze on Pete, asking, "Why are you running your mouth so much? I'm only asking&mdash;do you dare?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pete's lips curled into a scornful smile. "Dare? Of course, I dare. But it's no fun having Gibson fight a nobody like you for nothing. Let's make it interesting with a wager."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, the faces of Benjamin, Maxine, Brenden, and the others darkened further. Pete had already stolen the spotlight today, but he still wasn't satisfied. Now, he wanted to add a bet on top of it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "What do you want to bet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pete smirked. "Money. The Hudson </span><span>family's</span><span> got plenty of that. If you lose, Gibson gets to kill you. If you win&mdash;which is impossible&mdash;I'll pay you a billion dollars. How does that sound?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus lit a cigarette, taking a long drag before exhaling slowly. "Like you, the one thing I'm not short on is money. So, if I win, you can keep your one billion dollars. All I want is an arm."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd exchanged incredulous glances, one of them silently wondering, "He's giving up a billion dollars just for an arm? Is this kid really that rich?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after a moment's thought, they quickly understood the reasoning behind it. After all, Gibson's strength was overwhelming, and Marcus stood almost no chance of winning. Whatever wager he proposed was essentially meaningless. With that in mind, Pete agreed without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the watchful eyes of the crowd, Marcus stepped into the ring. On his way up, he crossed paths with Edward, who was being carried out by medics.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edward's face was pale with despair. He regretted not listening to Marcus earlier&mdash;maybe he wouldn't have ended up like this. Even so, he said nothing, still clinging to the remnants of his pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pete barked an order at Gibson, "Don't hold back. Break this idiot and then finish him off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gibson nodded, his lips curling into a bloodthirsty grin as he looked at Marcus. "</span><span>Uswad</span><span> trash. Haven't you already seen what I can do? And you still dare step into this ring?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus remained unfazed, his tone calm. "Stop yapping. Let's get this over with. I don't want to waste time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gibson's smile faltered, his brow furrowing in anger. With a roar, he charged at Marcus, activating the mechanical enhancements in his body right away. Clearly, he intended to end this quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the mechanical device activating, Gibson's power surged dramatically, and the force behind his attacks seemed even more terrifying than when he fought Edward. Many held their breath, some even shutting their eyes, unable to watch further, thinking, "If Edward had his limbs easily destroyed by Gibson, how could Marcus possibly fare any better?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus didn't even flinch. As Gibson's strike came barreling toward him, Marcus reached out with a single hand and caught Gibson's wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gibson froze, his entire body paralyzed by an overwhelming force he couldn't fight. </span><span>His face darkened as he struggled to break free, but it was useless. Marcus' grip was like an iron vise, unyielding no matter how hard Gibson tried to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a calm yet chilling voice, Marcus spoke. Then, with a brutal snap, Gibson's arm was broken.</span></p><div class="pagination">
