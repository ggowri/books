  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The shout thundered through the air, shaking the eardrums of everyone nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tracy, Lucas, Simon, and Tristan were frozen in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Jane, who had been standing next to Marcus, glanced at him in utter shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had been worried moments ago, fearing that the SWAT team's arrival would put Marcus in a dangerous spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she never expected that the high-ranking SWAT captain, Miles, who had been so imposing earlier, would now be bowing to Marcus with the utmost respect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a jaw-dropping moment for everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tristan's face went ashen, and he couldn't help but speak up, "Captain Donovan, are you sure you're not confused? As far as I know, this guy is just some pretty boy Jane's been keeping around. He doesn't seem special. Why would he be called 'Mr. Death'?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Riley joined in, a bit incredulous, "Yeah, Captain Donovan, this brat looks totally average. How could he be someone you're treating with such reverence?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before they could finish their sentences, Miles turned on them with a roar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Open your eyes and look closely! Mr. Death is someone I, myself, need to show respect to. When we were in Solomia, trying to capture the leader of the Black Hawk Legion, if it weren't for Mr. Death, we would all have died. The mission would have failed. Do you understand now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At those words, the entire group stood frozen, unable to process the gravity of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Riley, his voice trembling, asked in disbelief, "So... this is the Mr. Death you've been telling me about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had heard of the mission Miles had mentioned, where a young man had turned the tide. Riley had immense respect for the person behind it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Oliver, someone who usually held himself with pride, had shown nothing but respect in front of this man. To think that Marcus, someone they'd treated like a common thug, was the one who had saved them&mdash;it was like they were tempting fate by challenging him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tracy, Lucas, and Simon couldn't understand the specifics of the conversation, but it was clear that Marcus was no ordinary person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It hit them hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tracy, especially, couldn't bring herself to accept that Jane had chosen someone like him as her boyfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though they were sisters, Tracy's jealousy ran deep&mdash;deeper than anyone could imagine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tristan, still not willing to let go, muttered, "Whoever he is, publicly assaulting someone and disrespecting SWAT should get him arrested! Captain Donovan, you have to do what's right!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tristan was an outsider in this situation and didn't know the full weight of the mission in Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His knowledge of the operation came from news reports, and he assumed that Miles was simply being polite to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was no way Marcus could outrank Miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His father was an executive at Eastcomm Group, and he and Riley had been old classmates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Surely, Miles and Riley would respect him enough to arrest Marcus on the spot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Didn't you hear Captain Donovan telling you to shut up?" Riley snapped, his tone angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you say another word, forget that I'm friends with your father&mdash;I'll arrest you myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tristan went pale. He hadn't expected Riley to turn on him so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Riley, without missing a beat, walked up to Marcus and, with no hesitation, bowed deeply. "Mr. Death, I've heard so much about you. It's an honor to finally meet you. Please don't hold my previous words against me. I, Riley Rhodes, Deputy Captain of Ganston SWAT, am at your service!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Riley, in his fifties, saluted Marcus with military precision, his respect unmistakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that gesture, it was clear that the entire SWAT team had shifted its allegiance from Tristan to Marcus. They were now his supporters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Christopher, who had been watching, couldn't hide his astonishment. He had never imagined that things would escalate like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus gave a small wave to Miles and Riley and then turned his cold gaze to Tristan, Tracy, and Lucas. A smirk spread across his face as he spoke, "Weren't you three just saying that when the SWAT team arrived, it would be the end of me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three of them stiffened, their faces growing pale as they realized how wrong they had been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lucas, his voice tight with frustration, spat, "So what if you know a few cops? What's the big deal? Tristan's parents are high-level execs at Eastcomm Group. You're nothing compared to him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tristan puffed out his chest, finding a bit of confidence in Lucas' words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Exactly," he said, feeling a little better about himself. "My parents are high-ranking execs, and I'm doing pretty well myself. I supply parts to BioFusion Pharmaceuticals, and we make millions of dollars in profit every year. He can't compare to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tracy nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Simon chuckled lightly, a smirk crossing his face. "Sure, connections are important, but they can only take you so far. Knowing a few cops won't make you as important as Tristan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes flicked toward Miles and Riley as he spoke, trying to emphasize his point.</span></p><div class="pagination">
