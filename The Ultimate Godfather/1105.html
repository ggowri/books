        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made his body tremble violently, h</span><span>is eyes </span><span>filled with</span><span> shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under the infusion of that destructive force, he could no longer hold on. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His body was blasted away like a cannonball, crashing hard into a mountainside, dead beyond any doubt!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This scene caused everyone's expressions to freeze</span><span>. Everyone</span><span> star</span><span>ed</span><span> at</span><span>Marcus</span><span> in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bearded man had considerable cultivation </span><span>level </span><span>and ranked among the top in their team in overall strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet even so, he couldn't withstand a single attack from the young man before him and was killed in one strike. This was simply unbelievable!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For a moment, all attacks ceased, and everyone's eyes fell on </span><span>Marcus</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>Marcus</span><span>, why are you here?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at the tall man before her, </span><span>Gertie</span><span> </span><span>was</span><span> </span><span>beyond happy</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before this, she was besieged by these people, almost unable to hold on, even prepared to perish together with them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unexpectedly, in her moment of despair,</span><span>Marcus</span><span> arrived.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This reignited </span><span>Gertie</span><span>'s hope for survival.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm here to protect you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus</span><span> said, his gaze brazenly sweeping over </span><span>Gertie</span><span>'s impressive figure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling </span><span>Marcus</span><span>'s fiery gaze, </span><span>Gertie</span><span>'s pretty face flushed, and certain indescribable images involuntarily surfaced in her mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How did you know I would be here?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie</span><span> asked curiously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You are my woman, of course I know."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus</span><span> rubbed </span><span>Gertie</span><span>'s head.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, </span><span>Gertie</span><span>'s pretty face turned even redder. She should have hated </span><span>Marcus</span><span> for taking over her body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But for some reason, she could </span><span>not master any hatred towards</span><span> </span><span>Marcus</span><span>. Instead, the moment she saw him, a hint of joy arose in her heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kid, who do you think you are? How dare you kill our people? Do you have a death wish?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, an extremely cold voice came from the opposite side.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus</span><span> frowned, slowly turned around, and asked, "Are you people from the world beyond the </span><span>Ice Wall</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, those people were visibly stunned and looked at </span><span>Marcus</span><span> with strange expressions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The elder openly admitted, "Unexpectedly, even among you prisoners, there are those with sharp insight. It seems we underestimated you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus</span><span> frowned and said, "If that's the case, I really want to know </span><span>why are you here</span><span>. If it's simply to commit evil, then I definitely won't agree!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The elder sneered and said, "You won't agree? You're just a prisoner in a cage, do you really think you're a savior? Do you think you can change all this?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I advise </span><span>just mind your own business</span><span>, or else not only will you suffer, but those around you might also get dragged into it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus</span><span> said, "What if I insis</span><span>t</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long</span><span> ago, Nadia </span><span>warmed</span><span> him about the </span><span>weakening</span><span> of the </span><span>Ice Wall</span><span> barrier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>People from beyond the </span><span>Ice Wall</span><span> have broken in.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, </span><span>Marcus</span><span> didn't take it seriously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because he had previously encountered a remnant soul from the </span><span>A</span><span>ncient </span><span>L</span><span>and of Anak.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That remnant soul had traveled to this world through the Antarctic </span><span>Ice Wall</span><span> barrier. Due to certain dangers, it lost its physical body and couldn't return home</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>I</span><span>t</span><span> was </span><span>forced to wander</span><span> here</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>According to the remnant soul, there </span><span>were</span><span> many people from beyond the </span><span>Ice Wall</span><span> in this world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some of them, like him, </span><span>were</span><span> unable to return to their home due to certain circumstances.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There </span><span>were</span><span> also some who deliberately hid in this world, living as if they belong</span><span>ed</span><span> here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This indicate</span><span>d</span><span> that the Antarctic </span><span>Ice Wall</span><span> barrier show</span><span>ed</span><span> signs of </span><span>weakening</span><span> since ancient times.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Or perhaps, besides the space-time gate, there </span><span>we</span><span>re other unknown gaps allowing passage in and out of the </span><span>Ice Wall</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, </span><span>looking at </span><span>these people</span><span>, Marcus knew</span><span> the remnant soul's words</span><span> were true</span><span>.</span></p></div>
