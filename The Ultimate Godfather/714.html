  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Natalie, stop talking nonsense. You don't have a boyfriend. Are you talking about this guy? Who does he think he is? Why should he be your boyfriend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Natalie disagreed with him, Payne immediately became angry and kept signaling her with his eyes, fearing that she might upset Atlas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a great potential husband for Natalie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apart from the 20 million dollars, with Atlas' income, the benefits to their family in the future would be endless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Natalie married him, not only would Edwin not have to worry about finding a wife, but their family would have more money than they could ever spend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Payne didn't want to miss out on this opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, Natalie, this guy doesn't look like he has any money. You can't marry him! Our whole family is counting on you!" Edwin chimed in, agreeing with Payne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Natalie, I thought you were a smart girl. You've never been one to rush into relationships, but now you're acting so foolish. What does this guy have? What can he offer compared to Atlas?" Cora asked, her face filled with confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cora, Marcus is my lifesaver. He's the one who treated my illness, and he even drove me back home today after I was discharged," Mia couldn't hold it in anymore and spoke up for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cora narrowed her eyes and asked, "That Audi A6 downstairs, is that his?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Payne and Edwin heard that Marcus drove an Audi A6, they both gave him an appraising look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A car worth 400 to 500 thousand dollars wasn't something just anyone could afford.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed this guy wasn't as simple as he appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Marcus drove it, but it's his company's car..." Mia said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was an honest person who never lied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Cora asked, Mia simply told the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as she finished speaking, she regretted it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that by saying this, she would only cause Cora and the others to look down on Marcus even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, as soon as Mia finished speaking, Cora sneered and said, "I knew it. This guy doesn't look like he has any money. How could he afford an Audi A6?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know what car Atlas drives? A Mercedes-Benz G63. It costs over four million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, Edwin's eyes immediately lit up. "The Mercedes-Benz G63? That's my dream car! Atlas, you're amazing, you're so rich!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Atlas smiled and said, "This is nothing. Once I marry your sister, I'll buy you one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Edwin's face lit up with joy. "Atlas, you have to keep your word! If </span><span>you really buy me this, I'll make sure my sister will only marry you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Atlas looked at Edwin with a hint of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "People from the lower class have such limited vision. A Mercedes-Benz G63 is enough to make him so happy. He's clearly inexperienced."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The truth was, with his current income, he could buy at least ten Mercedes-Benz G63s a year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he really married Natalie, giving this kid one would be nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Natalie was so beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was even more stunning than the starlets Atlas used to pay for companionship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when he thought about the fact that Natalie already had a boyfriend and might not even be a virgin anymore, Atlas felt a sense of unwillingness rise in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a good woman, already taken by someone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, he turned to Marcus, and with a cold expression, he asked, "Are you Natalie's boyfriend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at Atlas and asked, "Is there something you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Atlas replied, "I want to ask what you do for a living, how much you make a year, and whether you can make Natalie happy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's it to you?" Marcus asked, and he was still calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was even more interested in watching this guy perform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Atlas smirked. "Not willing to say? It just proves you don't earn much. You should face reality and break up with Natalie. That's what you need to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Natalie will be much happier with me. You can rest easy knowing that," Atlas continued arrogantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had once been a low-ranking employee at Bayside Petroleum Company, but a chance encounter with the vice president of the company had propelled him into the position of department manager.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this opportunity, Atlas used his position to open several gas stations, causing his income to skyrocket within a year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Atlas was still in the phase of flaunting his newfound wealth, showing off everywhere he went.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had yet to understand the true realm of wealthy people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his eyes, someone like Marcus didn't deserve to compete with him for a woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I suggest you break up with my sister on your own. Otherwise, when </span><span>Atlas</span><span> steps in, you're going to be embarrassed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, you saved my mom's life, and I don't want to see you get punished too severely," Edwin immediately chimed in, adopting a tone similar to </span><span>Atlas'</span><span> lackey.</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
