  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a crystal was not useful for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had gone through great lengths to come to the Southern Market, so naturally, he wanted to purchase high-quality items.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A crystal like the one in front of him could only modify an ordinary gun, which was not worth his money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Marcus put the crystal back on the stall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crystals on this stall were already good enough to meet the needs of most people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Combined with the young vendor's shouting, soon many people gathered around the stall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you buying or not? If not, get out of the way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a cold rebuke came from behind Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned around and saw two young women standing behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman who spoke was wearing tight, plain clothes, with a tall and slender figure and a beautiful face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus judged from her aura that her cultivation had just broken through to Ancient Martial Stage Two not long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other woman was a few years younger, looking about twenty-three or twenty-four, with the same cultivation level as that woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The younger woman was livelier and more energetic than the one in tight clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Camy, look, he put the crystal down. I guess he can't afford it and is just looking around."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The younger woman glanced at Marcus with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This crystal costs only 50 million, which is quite cheap. Yet he still thinks it's expensive. It seems he really is as poor as you said."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman in tight clothes also mocked without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cooke frowned, wanting to argue with the two women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved his hand at Cooke, signaling him to calm down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Marcus looked at the vendor and asked, "May I ask if all your crystals are of this quality? Do you have any better ones?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vendor had also heard what the two women said and agreed with them in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> he disdainfully glanced at Marcus and said, "Crystals of this quality are already good enough. And didn't I say before? The one-hundred-million crystal is sold to you for 50 million, which is a great deal. If you can't afford it, please make way for the two ladies, and don't delay my business."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow slightly and turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two women continued to mock, "Admitting you can't afford it isn't shameful. But don't pretend to look down on it. If you really have the financial means, you can </span><span>gamble on stones. I'm afraid you don't have the guts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two women came from an ancient martial family, the Gunter family, located at the southwest border.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Gunter family had been passed down for dozens of generations, living in the rainforest of the southwest border.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman in plain clothes was named Camila Gunter, and the younger one was Jennifer Gunter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both were direct disciples of the Gunter family head, so Camila and Jennifer always considered themselves superior and looked down on others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Marcus had deliberately concealed his aura, others thought he had just reached Ancient Martial Stage Two, far inferior to Camila and Jennifer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Combined with Marcus' hesitant behavior earlier, it made Camila and Jennifer even more contemptuous of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't be bothered to deal with Camila and Jennifer. He asked Cooke, "Do you know where I can gamble on stones?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had seen scenes of gambling on stones in movies and web novels before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gambling on stones involved purchasing raw materials from specific stalls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These raw materials could only be judged by their appearance to determine if they contained high-quality crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This required accumulated experience and judgment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gambling venues would occasionally add ordinary stones to the raw materials to pass off inferior goods and make more profit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, the risk of gambling on stones was extremely high. One careless move could result in losing everything, even going bankrupt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, due to people's curiosity, lust, and desire for excitement, gambling on stones remained very popular.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were gambling stalls in most raw material markets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are many gambling stalls in the Southern Market, but the largest and most extensive one is Grand Fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The raw material quality at Grand Fortune is the highest in the Southern Market, but the prices are also the most expensive, and the risks are great. Mr. Fitzgerald, shall we go?" Cooke asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go to Grand Fortune," Marcus decided immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, under Cooke's guidance, Marcus arrived at the gambling site of Grand Fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Cooke had said, the scale here was indeed grander to the small stalls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grand Fortune occupied a vast area with all kinds of raw materials laid out on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people came here for its fame. Some were selecting materials, others were opening stones, and a large crowd was watching, their faces filled with excitement.</span></p><div class="pagination">
