  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as Landon finished speaking, Marcus' voice rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone paused in surprise, exchanging mocking glances with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially Landon, whose brows furrowed deeply. He turned to Marcus and asked, "Are you trying to lecture Mr. Zack?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied calmly, "I suppose you could say that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Landon's expression immediately turned even more mocking. "Earlier, they said you were skilled in medicine, and I didn't say anything. But now, you've gone too far, trying to teach Mr. Zack a lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Zack is a master of the Celestial Arc Order. You really have no idea what you're getting into!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neil shot Marcus a sideways glance and said to Davey, "Davey, even though he has helped us in the past, we can't let this nonsense continue while our father is critically ill. If his condition worsens because of this person, you'll all be responsible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I suggest, for the sake of our father's health, that we ask him to leave immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe nodded in agreement. "Yes, Uncle Davey. I've always felt something was off about this guy. Now he's totally out of line, trying to boss around Mr. Zack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This makes me question Melina's judgment. How could she possibly choose a guy like this as her boyfriend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Davey and Kari exchanged uneasy glances, their attention shifting entirely to Melina as if waiting for her response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Zack is truly a master of his craft. Perhaps we should calm down and wait for my grandfather's life-extending ritual to succeed. Then, we can leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina's expression was also tense. She had never imagined that Marcus would act this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom had demonstrated numerous extraordinary abilities when he arrived at their home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina had witnessed it firsthand and had been deeply impressed by the man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though she trusted Marcus completely, deep down, she didn't believe Marcus could compare to Tom when it came to medical expertise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I only say this because I'm concerned about Sir Thurman's well-being," Marcus explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words seemed to catch Tom's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom paused his ritual, his gaze turning toward Marcus. He asked, "Are you implying that my attempts to extend Sir Thurman's life are harming him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus fixed his gaze on Tom and responded coldly, "What you call life-extending is merely burning through Sir Thurman's Source Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And even then, it only extends his life by a few days. Once the Source Power is exhausted, Sir Thurman will have no hope left."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Complete nonsense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Marcus could finish speaking, Tom snapped angrily, "What's this about Source Power? I've never heard of it! You, a young man in your twenties, have no right to talk nonsense in front of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you keep this up, I'll have the Thurman family throw you out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Tom was clearly angered, Neil couldn't hold back anymore. He turned to Davey and said, "Davey, this guy is getting more outrageous. Why don't you get rid of him? If you anger Mr. Zack, our father won't make it through the night!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not only will our father die, but you'll also be branded as an unfilial son!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe added, "Yes, Uncle Davey, you can't let this man ruin everything. Mr. Zack was invited here with great effort by Mr. Whitman. You need to think carefully!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Davey's face turned a deep shade of gray as he struggled with the decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Marcus had helped the Thurman family immensely during the Bayside Amusement Park tender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt conflicted about throwing Marcus out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Marcus' gaze shifted back to Tom. He continued, "Not having heard of Source Power only shows how limited your knowledge is.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can tell from your darkened complexion and congested fingers that you've been performing similar rituals for others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because you've burned through too much of other people's Source Power, you're now suffering from severe backlash. Judging by your pulse, I'd say the backlash will peak tonight, and your life is at risk!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These words were met with complete disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neil, Cloe, and Landon all shot mocking looks at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Landon couldn't resist scoffing, "You really know how to talk nonsense. What I admire most about you is how convincingly you spin your lies. If I didn't know better, I might actually think you were telling the truth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now I'm starting to wonder if your billions were made by scamming people with your mouth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, Neil and Cloe nodded in agreement. They felt Landon had a point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their minds, Tom was the authority on this matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this guy in front of them had the nerve to criticize Tom. It was utterly disrespectful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom's expression turned even more sarcastic as he looked at Marcus, clearly amused. "Interesting. Very interesting. I've been performing rituals for decades, and I've never heard of this theory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got my attention now. Why don't you share more? Tell me everything you've seen."</span></p><div class="pagination">
