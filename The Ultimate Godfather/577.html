  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborn and Abraham finally scrambled to their feet, their faces ghostly pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all but dragged Darren, who was still clutching his mangled arm, as they bolted from the room without so much as a backward glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the door slammed shut, Liz seemed to come out of a daze, her expression caught somewhere between awe and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a shaky step forward, she hesitated, then lowered her head and bowed slightly. "Mr. Fitzgerald, I... I was wrong. I didn't recognize your importance, and I said things I shouldn't have. Please forgive me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, Liz truly understood what it meant to be in the presence of a true power player.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The real big shot would only wield their power when needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, the undisputed king of Kingston's underworld, wasn't just powerful&mdash;he exuded an effortless dominance that didn't need to be stated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to that, Abraham, with all his hollow bravado, was nothing but a child playing dress-up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the distance&mdash;a galaxy&mdash;between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liz had spent years looking up to men like Abraham, only to realize now how small-minded and foolish she had been. It stung to admit it, but in every way that mattered, her sister Lila had her beat by a mile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liz finally saw herself for what she was&mdash;a supporting act in a show she thought she was headlining.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, a small part of her clung to the hope that her actions had been motivated by good intentions, no matter how misguided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, the sister bond would end up nowhere but shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If not for Lila, you wouldn't even be worth my time," he said flatly, his voice carrying a sting that left Liz rooted to the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at her briefly, his gaze sharp and cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His meaning couldn't have been clearer&mdash;her apology meant nothing to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liz felt her stomach churn. To Marcus, she wasn't even on the radar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only reason Marcus had even bothered to show up to this dinner was because of Lila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, it had still turned into an unpleasant spectacle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacqueline stood awkwardly </span><span>nearby,</span><span> guilt written all over her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't bring herself to meet Marcus' eyes, the memory of her sharp words earlier cutting into her like a dull knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila, ever perceptive, stepped in, her voice warm and reassuring. "Mom, you don't need to beat yourself up about this. I know you were just trying to protect me. Maybe not like that next time, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacqueline's eyes filled with tears as she grabbed Lila's hand. "It's all my fault. I shouldn't have been so quick to judge. I hope you can forgive me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You may be my stepdaughter, but you're a better daughter than I deserve. I hope you </span><span>can understand that I meant for your own good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila smiled, shaking her head. "If I didn't know where your heart was, do you think I'd still be here having dinner with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacqueline pulled Lila into a tight hug, her tears spilling freely now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus watched the emotional exchange in silence, his face unreadable. He had no interest in intervening&mdash;it wasn't his place to meddle in Lila's family affairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a few more words, Marcus and Lila finally excused themselves, leaving the room together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liz stared after them, her regret weighing heavily on her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only she hadn't been so quick to mock Marcus, a single word from him could've opened doors she hadn't even known existed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now? That ship had sailed. With the way she'd treated him, Marcus wouldn't throw her a crumb unless she got on her knees&mdash;or begged Lila to do it for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Liz," Jacqueline said softly, her tone filled with regret. "We can't hurt your sister again&mdash;not after everything she's been through. She lost her mother young, and she's done so much for us. She still comes back every year, and still helps us when we need it. I don't deserve her kindness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liz nodded so hard it was a wonder her neck didn't snap. Regret etched deep lines across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't believe how she'd treated Lila&mdash;her own sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sisters were supposed to stick together, no matter what.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abraham and Osborn were on the bay home, and in the car, Abraham sat in brooding silence, his thoughts racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad... is Marcus Fitzgerald really that dangerous?" Abraham asked hesitantly, his voice barely above a whisper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think I'm making this up?" </span><span>Osborn</span><span> snapped, his tone brimming with irritation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He killed our general with one move," he said, his voice lowering as if the memory itself demanded reverence. "One strike&mdash;gone, just like that. He wiped out a team of warriors from the Celestial Arc Order, forced Dragon Tiger Hall to bow to the Axe Gang, and did it all without breaking a sweat. If he wanted to, he could've ended everyone in that room without lifting a finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now tell me, Abraham, does that sound like someone to take lightly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abraham's blood ran cold, the weight of his father's words sinking in like lead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' power was beyond his wildest imagination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he'd known any of this before, he wouldn't have dared to even glance at Marcus the wrong way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His stomach churned with fear, his pulse racing like a jackhammer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If his father hadn't groveled like that, Marcus probably would've ended him right then and there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought made his skin crawl, and a fresh wave of sweat dripped down his temple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember this," Osborn said sharply, his voice cutting through Abraham's thoughts like a knife. "Stay away from Marcus Fitzgerald. Don't get involved in anything remotely connected to him. One mistake, and you're done for."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abraham nodded quickly, this time with complete sincerity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally understood&mdash;Marcus wasn't just powerful; he was untouchable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking back, even Marcus' brutal treatment of Darren felt restrained. Abraham shuddered, realizing just how much worse it could've been.</span></p><div class="pagination">
