Suddenly, two bolts of lightning came crashing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Purple lightning lit up the sky, striking with terrifying force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two Wizards, shocked, desperately released spells to resist, but still, the lightning hit them squarely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both let out muffled groans, blood trickling from their mouths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, the elder's smile faded, and a dangerous glint appeared in his ancient eyes. "It seems I underestimated you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the elder moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A simple step, and his body seemed to blur, creating countless afterimages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The aura of an Ancient Martial Art Stage Four expert exploded in full force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He threw a punch, and the punch's energy split into several devastating phantom strikes in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each one was powerful enough to obliterate an average Ancient Martial Art Stage Three practitioner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't want to move so quickly, but you've forced me. You should be proud to die by my hand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elder's voice was low but resonated with a shockwave powerful enough to shatter surrounding stones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the terrifying display of power, Marcus remained unfazed, not even attempting to dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having practiced the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, his personal strength far surpassed that of his current opponents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing the elder's deadly strikes, Marcus simply invoked Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His aura shifted dramatically, growing even more formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simultaneously, </span><span>Thunderfire</span><span> Power surged, coalescing around his own punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massive surge of destructive </span><span>Thunderfire</span><span> Power shot out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deafening crash echoed as their energies collided, unleashing waves of destruction in every direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two Wizards were caught in the heart of the storm, their bodies being pushed back again and again as their chests heaved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elder smirked, pumping even more destructive force into his punch, hoping to strike Marcus down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as the collision intensified, the elder suddenly sensed something was wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From Marcus' punch erupted a terrifying surge of </span><span>Thunderfire</span><span> Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power surged up his arm, burning with incredible force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elder screamed in agony as he tried to extinguish the </span><span>Thunderfire</span><span> Power, but it was futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The destructive force was overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A burning smell filled the air as his arm turned to ash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He staggered back, crying out in disbelief, "How is this possible? You were supposed to be at Ancient Martial Art Stage Three! How could you be a Stage Four expert? And you're mixing magic with martial arts? What is going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smirked coldly, refusing to answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a single step, he moved forward, striking with a terrifying palm aimed at the elder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as he neared, he felt a cold light flash like a lightning bolt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus instinctively dodged, but still felt a sharp pain in his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't reacted in time, he would have lost his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frowning, he saw the elder had drawn a golden curved blade, still stained with blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole area seemed to be shrouded in a deadly aura emanating from the blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kid, your life is mine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elder's eyes flashed with murderous intent as he swung the blade toward Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This strike was more powerful than anything before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, the two Wizards moved as well, channeling their most powerful magic to assault Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Together, their combined assault was overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes gleamed with determination. He wasn't about to waste any more time. Instead of retreating, he charged directly at the elder's blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elder sneered, thinking Marcus was seeking death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in that instant, as the blade was about to strike, Marcus unleashed Celestial Reversal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the deadly blade was deflected by the Celestial Reversal, flying straight back toward the elder.</span></p><div class="pagination">
