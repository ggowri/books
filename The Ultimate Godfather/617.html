  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you claim to be the top-tier custom jewelry store in Solomia, is this how you treat your customers?" Marcus coldly asked as his gaze swept over the numerous security guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gabe chuckled sarcastically and said, "We only treat our real customers with courtesy. People like you, who can't afford it yet come to cause trouble, can only be kicked out of the store!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, you think I can't afford the jewelry here just based on that woman's word?" Marcus continued to inquire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without even a moment of hesitation, Gabe looked down on him and said, "Dude, I can tell you're from the same social bottom as me from your pitiful face. Stop pretending to be rich and just leave. Might get away from beating up as well!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus ignored Gabe and Natalie, instead turning to Elena, who had previously served him. He handed her a card and said, "Pack all the jewelry in this store for me, please!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, everyone was stunned and incredulous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many even thought they were hallucinating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did this guy say? Is he really going to buy all the jewelry in the store?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is definitely out of his mind, talking nonsense like that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, he's getting more and more outrageous. I wonder if he escaped from some mental institution!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The jewelry in this store is all handmade by top-tier jewelers, each piece being priceless. To buy all the jewelry in the entire store would require at least 500 million dollars. He must be insane!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After realizing what was happening, everyone started chatting among themselves, looking at Marcus with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie and Joan also exchanged glances, both showing mocking smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie said, "Marcus, I haven't seen you for years, and I don't know what you've been through to cause those problems in your mind. I just simply can't understand how you can boldly say such things in front of so many people. Do you know how much the jewelry in my store is worth?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus snickered and said, "No matter how much they are, I'll buy it all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie looked at Marcus with strange eyes and asked, "What if you can't?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus laughed and said, "If I can't, you can do whatever you want with me. The question is&mdash;what if I can?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dismissing it with a wave of her hand, she said, "Well, you can do whatever you want with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie didn't even consider it for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason was simple. In her opinion, Marcus was either mentally stimulated or suffering from some mental illness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, a normal person would never say such foolish boasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, in Natalie's view, it didn't matter what she promised Marcus because she would never lose this bet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bring me the inventory bill!" Natalie instructed a saleswoman nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' arrogance seemed to greatly provoke her competitive drive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since he was so presumptuous, she would humiliate this arrogant man severely today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joan was also watching this with interest, waiting for Natalie to make Marcus come to his senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the saleswoman brought out the inventory bill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Natalie calculated the total price of all the jewelry displayed in the store in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>About fifteen minutes later, Natalie's calculator stopped buzzing, and the screen displayed an astonishing number&mdash;650 million dollars!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this number, everyone couldn't help but gasp in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among those present, the lowest-status individuals were from the middle class, but the number of 650 million dollars still astounded them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps someone here could have a total net worth of that amount, but there was a big difference between someone who had 650 million dollars and someone who could casually spend 650 million dollars on jewelry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like a person with a net worth of 600 million dollars was able to afford a piece of jewelry worth 20 million dollars, but they certainly wouldn't be too willing to pay that much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A total of 650 million dollars. You just said you would buy all the jewelry. Now pay up!" Natalie stared at Marcus and said with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her view, she would soon spit on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said to Elena, "The password for this card is 123456. Please help me make the payment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elena's eyes flickered as she looked at the card in her hand, a little dazed. She thought, "Does this card really have that much money? If it does, then the password he set is too random. If someone else took this card, they could easily crack the password."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, these were just her casual thoughts, and she quickly went to the cashier to prepare to swipe the card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, you still refuse to give in, huh? I even began to admire your courage. If you apologize to me now, I can be lenient with you, considering we were classmates once. Otherwise, you'll definitely regret it!" Natalie looked at Marcus and said cockily.</span></p><div class="pagination">
