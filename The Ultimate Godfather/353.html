  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, the factory for the pharmaceutical company is finally ready. When will you come by to check it out? The city engineering team is supposed to inspect it this afternoon," Michelle's soft, composed voice came through the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What time are they scheduled?" Marcus asked, his tone calm but precise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"2:00 PM," Michelle replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll be there before two."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus hung up and decided to take a short rest before heading out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At 1:00 PM, Marcus left Bayside Villa and drove toward the industrial construction site.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon arrival, he was greeted by the sight of spacious, modern factory buildings. The entire park was impeccably designed, with a layout that radiated efficiency and sophistication.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walking alongside Michelle through the newly completed industrial park, Marcus felt a rare sense of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After more than two months of hard work, the project was finally nearing completion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the engineering department completed their inspection, they could move forward with installing equipment and launching production.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought alone filled Marcus with anticipation, his focus sharpening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This pharmaceutical company wasn't just another business venture&mdash;it symbolized the ambitions he had when he first started out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what, he was determined to make it a success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's already 2:00. Where are the inspectors from the engineering department?" Marcus asked, glancing at Michelle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle frowned, her brow knitting slightly. The team should have arrived by now, or at least called to explain the delay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly dialed the deputy director of the engineering department, Oscar Cromwell. "Deputy Cromwell, we scheduled the inspection for 2:00. Everything on our end is ready. May I ask when you'll be arriving?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle's voice was polite, carefully measured to avoid giving any offense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the man on the other end was anything but civil. His voice came through gruff and dismissive, brimming with annoyance. "What's the rush? We've got a full schedule of inspections today. Just wait your turn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle's grip tightened on her phone, though she kept her tone even. "Deputy Cromwell, we understand you're busy, but could you give us an estimate? We have other matters to attend to as well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't say for sure," he snapped. "If you're too impatient, we can reschedule&mdash;but I'm not promising when that'll be!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for a response, he hung up abruptly, leaving Michelle stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle let out a slow breath, visibly trying to calm herself before turning to Marcus with an apologetic look. "Mr. Fitzgerald, they still haven't shown up, and now they're acting like this. I arranged everything days ago, but they're ignoring the schedule. These bureaucrats just keep getting more arrogant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled softly. "Did you grease the wheels a little?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle sighed, exasperated. "Of course I did. We gave two department heads five million each, but it's like they've already forgotten. They're probably fishing for more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew these officials all too well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The delay wasn't an accident&mdash;it was a deliberate move to extract more bribes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, we don't have much choice," Marcus said, his voice steady. "We'll wait a little longer. Without their approval, we can't move forward with production."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the time, Marcus preferred to avoid unnecessary conflict.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as people didn't overstep their boundaries, he was willing to let minor issues slide for the sake of keeping the peace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He understood all too well how murky and corrupt bureaucracy could be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's why he allowed his businesses to offer certain "incentives" to officials when needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a pragmatic approach to ensure his companies could operate smoothly and continue growing without unnecessary roadblocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if someone pushed too far, Marcus wasn't one to let things slide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his calm demeanor, Michelle nodded, though her frustration was evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two spent the next hour walking through the factories, carefully inspecting for any flaws or areas needing improvement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By 4:00 PM, the inspectors still hadn't shown up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Growing impatient, Michelle suggested they leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't wait here forever, after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus reluctantly agreed, preparing to leave the site.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as they were about to go at 4:20 PM, a convoy of vehicles rolled into the industrial park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cars bore large blue lettering: ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leading the convoy was a Toyota Land Cruiser, from which stepped a portly, balding man with an air of smug authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following him were several younger staff members in hard hats and surveyor uniforms, carrying tools for the inspection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle's eyes lit up at the sight of them. Turning to Marcus, she said, "Finally. That man&mdash;the one with the smug look&mdash;is Deputy Director Cromwell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at the group, his expression calm and unreadable, then nodded slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her earlier frustration, Michelle maintained her composure, walking up to greet Oscar with a polite smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deputy Cromwell, we're glad you're here. It's getting late&mdash;let's start the inspection right away," she said, her tone professional but warm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar's gaze lingered on Michelle for a moment, a flicker of greed in his eyes that he didn't bother hiding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cast a cursory glance at the factory buildings before sneering, "No need for an inspection. These buildings aren't up to code. Tear them down and rebuild them from scratch."</span></p><div class="pagination">
