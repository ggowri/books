  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie</span><span> looked a bit confused and asked, "What are you laughing at? Why are you laughing at me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus</span><span> forcibly suppressed his laughter and said, "I'm laughing because you're both naive and adorable."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"To be honest with you, even if you didn't kiss me, I wouldn't ignore these cases."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie</span><span> immediately felt tricked and had the urge to beat up the guy in front of her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tell me, why are you so bad?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie</span><span>'s chest heaved with anger, and the two peaks on her chest seemed as if they were about to break free from her clothes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Haven't you heard the saying, 'Women love bad boys'?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus</span><span> suddenly looked at </span><span>Gertie</span><span> seriously, leaning in so close that he almost filled her entire view, and asked, "Be honest with me, have you fallen in love with me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie</span><span>'s face flushed red upon hearing this, and her heart inexplicably started to race as she looked at </span><span>Marcus</span><span>'s impeccably handsome face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She almost couldn't help but nod, but her inner rationality suppressed it as she said, "Don't talk nonsense, I haven't..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although she still denied it, </span><span>Marcus</span><span> had already gotten a definite answer from </span><span>Gertie</span><span>'s expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah! </span><span>Marcus</span><span>, look, those people you killed </span><span>all looked different</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, </span><span>Gertie</span><span> seemed to see something terrifying</span><span>, </span><span>grab</span><span>bing</span><span> </span><span>Marcus</span><span>'s body tightly and scream</span><span>ing</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus</span><span> followed </span><span>Gertie</span><span>'s gaze and saw that the corpses on the ground had indeed changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, they still looked human, but now they had turned into human bodies with snake heads.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The snake heads were of various types, resembling known species like pythons, cobras, black mambas, rattlesnakes, and so on.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Combined with human bodies, they looked extremely grotesque and terrifying, giving off an unsettling feeling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made </span><span>Marcus</span><span>'s brows furrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He asked </span><span>Gertie</span><span>, "They come from the world beyond the </span><span>Ice Wall</span><span>. Do you know of any continent beyond the </span><span>Ice Wall</span><span> where such </span><span>creatures </span><span>exist?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie</span><span> </span><span>pondered for a moment</span><span>. </span><span>A</span><span>s if recalling something, her eyes lit up and she said, "I remember now. I think I once heard the elders in my family mention that beyond the </span><span>Ice Wall</span><span>, on a continent called Lemuria, there are creatures that are half-human, half-snake living there</span><span> They are called Ophidian</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Could it be that these monsters come from Lemuria?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus</span><span> nodded lightly, "It's very possible. I'll first open their </span><span>Spatial R</span><span>ings to see if I can find any clues inside."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, </span><span>Marcus</span><span> used the Heavenly Circle Diagram to shield this space, isolating everything within from the outside world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately after, he unlocked all the </span><span>Ophidians</span><span>'s </span><span>Spatial</span><span> </span><span>R</span><span>ings and took out the contents one by one.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During this time, </span><span>Marcus</span><span> discovered that, besides common items like pills, weapons, and magical treasures, there were also many strange and unusual </span><span>item</span><span>s.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These strange and unusual items were things he had never seen in this world and were likely exclusive to the world where the </span><span>Ophidian</span><span> lived.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among them, a map drawn on animal hide successfully caught </span><span>Marcus</span><span>'s attention.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He unfolded the map and saw a sea</span><span> area</span><span>, with an extremely vast continent located at the center.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The continent was surrounded by numerous islands.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Th</span><span>e map clearly marked the major cities on the continent, the connecting roads between them, and even detailed down to towns and villages.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the name of the continent was not marked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Lemuria Continent!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as </span><span>Marcus</span><span> was guessing the name of the continent, </span><span>Gertie</span><span> let out a gasp.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Can you be sure this is Lemuria?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus</span><span> asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>Yes </span><span>I ca</span><span>n</span><span>. I once saw a wooden plaque in my family's library. That plaque had the detailed outline and name of this continent engraved on it&mdash;Lemuria. It left a very deep impression on me!"</span><span> </span><span>Gertie</span><span> nodded and said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then that means th</span><span>e Ophidian</span><span> really come</span><span>s</span><span> from this continent."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus</span><span> said in surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lemuria was already the second continent he had encountered beyond the </span><span>Ice Wall</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seems, just as that remnant soul said, </span><span>there are many continents in </span><span>the world beyond the </span><span>Ice Wall</span><span>, each possibly much larger than those within the </span><span>Ice Wall</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There lies the truly vast world, filled with countless unexpected wonders.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since their </span><span>Spatial R</span><span>ings contain this map, </span><span>we can confirm</span><span> that they come from this continent."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie</span><span> took a deep breath and said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, </span><span>Marcus</span><span> continued searching and, besides some cultivation resources, he also found a manual in the old man's </span><span>Spatial Ring</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The manual recorded many events the old man had experienced, including the reason for coming to the world within the </span><span>Ice Wall</span><span> this time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After </span><span>some </span><span>carefully reading, </span><span>Marcus</span><span> discovered that they came to this world under the assignment of someone named Roderick Clifford</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This person should be the master they mentioned.</span></p><div class="pagination">
