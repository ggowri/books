        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The windowless room made escape impossible for any ordinary person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Marcus, however, this was hardly an obstacle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could easily blast the iron door to pieces with a casual display of his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet he chose to remain quietly in the room instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I'm truly sorry for dragging you into this mess," Cecilia said with genuine remorse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt awful seeing Marcus imprisoned alongside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was etched with guilt as she spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please don't think that way, Ms. McHale, and don't blame yourself," Marcus replied reassuringly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I allowed them to bring me here of my own accord. Trust me, no one could keep me here if I didn't want to stay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, as long as I'm around, your uncle won't get his hands on McHale Pharmaceuticals Group. You'll remain at the helm where you belong," Marcus said with a confident smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecilia felt touched by Marcus' optimistic attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her beautiful eyes flickered with emotion before a shadow of sadness crossed her delicate features. "Please don't try to comfort me, Mr. Fitzgerald. I know what lies ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as my uncle doesn't harm my grandfather, I can accept not being the head of the family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From Cecilia's perspective, Marcus tried to console her with empty words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joel would never have dared to send Haywood to </span><span>Uswad</span><span> to make arrests unless he was confident about taking over the Helmsman's position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given his typically cautious nature, Joel would never have taken such a bold step without absolute certainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Joel wielded far more power and influence than she hoped to match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For example, Haywood wasn't someone an ordinary person could mess with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a fifth-generation cyborg for crying out loud!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And his enhancements were top-notch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Marcus possessed exceptional medical skills, he had even managed to cure her congenital heart condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Cecilia couldn't imagine Marcus having enough strength to go toe-to-toe with Joel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even dealing with someone like Haywood would be way out of Marcus' league.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The only thing bothering me right now is dragging you into this mess. If I had known this would happen, I never would have met with you. It is all my fault!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecilia broke down in tears, her grief pouring out uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus rushed to comfort her, saying, "Ms. McHale, I swear everything I've told you is accurate. You have to believe me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I arranged for them to bring us here specifically so I could help you reclaim what rightfully belongs to you tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' words only made Cecilia cry harder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' claims seemed far-fetched to her, given that her uncle was so powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing how deeply distressed she was, Marcus found himself at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only try his best to offer what comfort he could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unconsciously, Cecilia found herself leaning into Marcus' embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gently comforted her, trying his best to help her calm down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time quickly moved forward to the second day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone opened the door before 8 in the morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haywood walked in with several men in black suits and coldly addressed Cecilia, "Ms. McHale, Mr. McHale's inauguration ceremony is about to begin. I suggest you behave yourself, or not only will your grandfather not make it, but this young man won't survive either!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecilia's face turned slightly pale at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It became clear that Joel had kept Rhett alive only to ensure she would surrender her position as the family leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They would kill Rhett without hesitation if she refused to give up her position!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Haywood's direction, Marcus and Cecilia were forcefully escorted to the inauguration ceremony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The event was held in McHale Pharmaceuticals Group's grand ballroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today marked the inauguration of McHale Pharmaceuticals Group's new leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many prominent figures from </span><span>Acoton's</span><span> high society had already gathered there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guest list even included notable personalities from beyond </span><span>Acoton</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The McHale family patriarch, Rhett, sat in the main seat, still maintaining his dignified appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, a closer look would reveal the time bomb that had been planted on his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he didn't follow their orders, the bomb could be detonated at any moment!</span></p></div>
