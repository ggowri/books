        <h1>Chapter 405 Stage Four</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Jane left the room, Marcus sat cross-legged on the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After two consecutive interactions of feminine energy and masculine energy, he felt that the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire he was cultivating was about to break through to Stage Four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hurriedly began to cultivate Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once he broke through to Stage Four, his strength would have another qualitative leap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Strands of Timeless Numinous Energy flew through the energy channels in his body, circulating through the whole body, and finally converged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Timeless Numinous Energy was full and contained powerful nourishing effects, which nourished every inch of Marcus' body cells.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the circulation of the Timeless Numinous Energy in his body intensified, Marcus' Timeless Warrior's Grimoire was pushed to its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He practiced it with all his strength, taking out a pill and swallowing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the help of the pill, the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire finally broke through the bottleneck and reached Stage Four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Marcus underwent another transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Timeless Numinous Energy was also purer and richer than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whether using the Timeless Numinous Energy to fight or heal injuries, it was much stronger than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More importantly, after breaking through to Stage Four, Marcus gained another special ability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Cultivation of feminine and masculine energy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These words emerged in Marcus' mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The cultivation of feminine and masculine energy was a way of enhancing one's abilities through the intercourse of feminine energy and masculine energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before, Marcus had only seen people with similar abilities in some novels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He never thought that one day he would master this ability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The cultivation of feminine and masculine energy in novels was usually about taking feminine energy to replenish masculine energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In other words, through this method, men could absorb women's energy to increase their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, after the cultivation, the male cultivator, who was the dominant one, could usually gain the greatest benefit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, for women, it would cause irreversible and huge harm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were even more evil cultivation manuals that could turn women into mummies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the cultivation of feminine and masculine energy that Marcus mastered was different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With this method, not only could he gain great benefits, but he could also pass on these benefits to his female companion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In other words, both parties benefited from his cultivation, and the extent of benefit to both parties was roughly the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Understanding this, Marcus smiled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If the cultivation of feminine and masculine energy he obtained was to absorb women's energy, he would rather not cultivate it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he didn't reject this kind of cultivation which benefited both sides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was even looking forward to the effects of cultivating with women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, it was early morning of the next day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus received a call from Michelle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The equipment in the Pharmaceutical Industrial Park had been installed and debugged, and it would officially go into production as soon as he went over to cut the ribbon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus took a taxi to the Pharmaceutical Industrial Park, which had already been decorated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Michelle came here with the senior executives of the Golden Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were also people from City Hall in Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even some celebrities from the entertainment industry were invited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When it came to the ribbon-cutting, Marcus didn't want to show up in public, so he asked Michelle and a leader from Solomia to go on stage together to complete the ribbon-cutting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a shareholder of the pharmaceutical company, Charles also attended the ribbon-cutting ceremony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne also came. After a period of familiarization and planning, she had taken over all the management matters of the Pharmaceutical Industrial Park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had extensive experience in management and sales in the pharmaceutical industry abroad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For her, taking over the park was a smooth process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the roar of production equipment, the Pharmaceutical Industrial Park officially went into production.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus had finally fulfilled his dream when he first started his business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the help of Charles, the Pharmaceutical Industrial Park had launched many patented medical drugs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During the preheating stage alone, there were a large number of domestic and foreign orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That night, under the organization of Michelle, the Golden Group hosted a banquet for leaders from City Hall in Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus, Charles, and Yvonne also attended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking that he was not suitable for this kind of occasion, Marcus prepared to leave halfway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne chased after him and stopped him. "What have you been busy with recently? You haven't talked to me for a long time. What do you mean? Have you forgotten me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked resentful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She remembered that the last time she was alone with Marcus was a month ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During this month, the two of them only occasionally chatted online and rarely met each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne felt a sense of crisis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How could I forget you? I'm just too busy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Humph, I think you don't want to contact me because you have another woman. Michelle looks at you differently. You are such a playboy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne snorted coldly and turned away deliberately, no longer looking at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, a red light flashed out of the sky, and before Marcus could react, it fell on Yvonne.</span></p></div>
