        <h1>Chapter 318 Bite the Hand That Feeds You</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"One hundred billion dollars? You must be crazy. Looking around the world, I have never seen anyone dare to charge such a high medical fee!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon reacted immediately, becoming angry and yelling at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One hundred billion dollars, although he could barely scrape it together, it would nearly bankrupt him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the Cole family was a collective, and his personal wealth was not that much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you don't want treatment, leave early. I don't force you to seek my help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus said disdainfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon gritted his teeth angrily and said, "Alright, I promise you, once you cure my grandson, I will immediately transfer 100 billion dollars to your account."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus shook his head. "Pay first, then I'll save him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon's eyes flashed angrily, and his expression was worse than eating dirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly stepped aside and made a phone call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This phone conversation lasted for over ten minutes. It was clear that coming up with 100 billion dollars wasn't easy for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After receiving the payment notification, Marcus headed to Solariae Hospital together with Robert and Jordon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When he was only trained at Ancient Martial Stage Two, Marcus could easily cure the cancer of Catherine's mother, Laura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, his cultivation had reached the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Four, and his strength had skyrocketed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even with Mike's pancreatic cancer, it could still be easily treated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus eradicated Mike's cancer cells in less than 10 minutes and then left the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Mike's complexion gradually returning to a healthy flush, Jordon was filled with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mike, you finally woke up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After waking up, Mike felt that all his previous discomfort was gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, he felt full of strength again and couldn't help but ask Jordon, "Grandpa, is my cancer cured?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon nodded vigorously. "OK, it's all right. I checked it myself with the instrument just now. Marcus is amazing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he hadn't seen it with his own eyes, Jordon wouldn't have believed that such medical skills existed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He finally understood why Robert regarded Marcus as the best doctor in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone who could cure cancer in 10 minutes was likely unrivaled globally!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grandpa, did you beg Marcus?" Mike asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As his illness worsened, Mike soon passed out, unaware of what happened next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, that guy charged me 100 billion dollars for treatment!" Jordon said angrily, his face full of resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What, 100 billion dollars?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this figure, Mike was immediately shocked. "Isn't that all the assets in our family, Grandpa? How could you agree to that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon was filled with helplessness. "If I didn't agree, he wouldn't save you. I had no other choice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This guy is asking for a lot!" Mike said angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mike's gaze turned intense, and he said, "I think he's sincerely trying to extort us. Since that's the case, don't blame me for being ruthless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon looked at him and asked, "What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mike made a throat-slitting gesture. "He dares to blackmail the Cole family. He's asking for death. I must make him pay for this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, Mike directly took out his mobile phone and made a call. "Uswad, Solariae, help me kill someone. Name your price!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying this, Mike hung up the phone and told Jordon, "Grandpa, don't worry, Marcus won't see the sun tomorrow. After he dies, the 100 billion dollars will still belong to us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Mike sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon also sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They thought, "Since Marcus is heartless, don't blame us for our injustice!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus naturally didn't know this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back at the hotel from the hospital, Marcus was ready to continue his training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was one o'clock in the middle of the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sensed some movement outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He instinctively released his spiritual senses, and the scene outside the door became instantly clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He saw a few men in black with their faces covered and submachine guns trying to pry open his door!</span></p></div>
