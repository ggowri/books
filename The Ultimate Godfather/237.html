        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus suddenly felt a soft warmth against his lips, sending a shiver through his entire body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he was no stranger to women, Melina felt entirely different from anyone he'd encountered before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A delicate fragrance, reminiscent of orchids, seemed to emanate from her&mdash;a scent Marcus had noticed the first time he met her at that party.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, he thought it was perfume, but he soon realized it was her natural scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't just any fragrance; it was utterly unique and intoxicating, stirring emotions </span><span>deep within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An Innate Enchanting Physique, Marcus thought, a term surfacing in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this world, where professions like warriors, wizards, metahumans, </span><span>beastmasters</span><span>, physical adepts, and rune crafters existed, some individuals possessed rare and extraordinary constitutions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One such gift was the Innate Enchanting Physique, a natural trait that radiated irresistible charm through an innate fragrance, ensnaring the opposite sex regardless of the individual's personality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina didn't just have striking beauty&mdash;her enchanting physique emitted an orchid-like scent that made Marcus' heart race uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was no surprise that Troy had struggled to keep his hands to himself back at the pool party.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with Marcus so close, Melina could feel his warm breath, thick with masculine energy, washing over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't suppress her emotions any longer. Her lips parted, and her tongue gently slipped into Marcus' mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desire ignited in Marcus like a wildfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled Melina into his arms, kissing her deeply as his hands instinctively wandered to her curves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had admired her enchanting figure before, back at Harvey's private villa&mdash;her smooth skin that seemed to glow, her perfectly shaped chest that defied gravity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her skin was not only smooth but flawless, without even a freckle to be found.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt as if he were holding a work of art.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his hand cupped her breast, Melina let out a soft moan, her cheeks flushing a deep crimson. "Mr. Fitzgerald... I want you," she whispered, her breath warm and fragrant, the orchid-like scent now more intoxicating than ever as her emotions peaked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure?" Marcus murmured, his voice low and thick with desire. "Becoming my woman... you won't regret it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina shook her head feverishly, her body trembling under his touch. "I'll never regret it. Being your woman is the greatest honor of my life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she slowly slipped off her dress, revealing her flawless, porcelain-like body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beneath it, she wore a light pink lace bra, its delicate design perfectly accentuating her ample curves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deep valley between her breasts invited his gaze, an endless source of temptation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus could no longer hold back. With one swift motion, he tugged her bra away, freeing her shapely breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They bounced slightly, their rosy tips standing proudly, as perfect as pearls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kissed her neck, his hands caressing her soft curves, fingers teasing her sensitive peaks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina let out a cry, her voice trembling with both surprise and pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her enchanting physique flared with intensity, a trait that not only captivated others but heightened her own sensitivity to the touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, under Marcus' hands and lips, her entire body was aflame with sensation. Her cheeks flushed like ripe peaches, and her half-lidded eyes shimmered with unspoken desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus took one of her hardened peaks into his mouth, his tongue skillfully teasing her, and Melina's body shuddered as if struck by lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, she reached her first-ever climax, her cries filling the room as her body quivered uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seizing the moment, Marcus' hand slid beneath her skirt, finding the delicate lace of </span><span>her panties already soaked through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint, sweet scent wafted from her, teasing his senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald... you're so naughty," she panted, her body writhing against him. "Do you always treat women this way?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled, his voice a husky whisper. "Only you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Liar!" she shot back, giving him a playful glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could say more, Marcus pinned her beneath him, spreading her long, shapely legs apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pink lace of her panties stood in stark contrast to her smooth skin. With a single tug, he slid them off, revealing the glistening heat beneath.</span></p></div>
