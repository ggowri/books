        <h1>Chapter 418 A Promise to Heal</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite the mess he was in, Darian still considered himself a man of honor. But with both his mother-in-law and wife turning their backs on him in his time of need, even though he felt the sting deep inside, he had no choice but to agree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I didn't come here to ask for the 150 thousand dollars," Marcus spoke up, breaking the tension. "The divorce is no need."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He handed Darian back the 100 thousand dollars that had been given to the dealership that morning. "Here, take this. I told you before, I'll cover the repair costs myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian, overwhelmed with gratitude, stammered, "Mr. Fitzgerald, you're too kind. I can't thank you enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ramona, too, gave Marcus a look that was almost full of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian turned to his mother-in-law. "Aniya, I don't need to pay for the repairs anymore. As for the divorce, I think we can let that go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd been married to Ramona for three years, and they had a deep connection. The thought of losing her was gut-wrenching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not happening!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aniya's voice sliced through the air. "That 100 thousand dollars was borrowed from loan sharks! You think just because this man gave it back, things will magically get better for Ramona? Let me tell you straight&mdash;Director Rollins' son is waiting to marry Ramona.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The minute you two are divorced, he's going to swoop in. So don't drag her down with your failures. Someone like you will never get anywhere!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus couldn't help but feel disgusted by Aniya's attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He finally had enough and shot back, "Darian's only 25. You've been married for five years. How can you be so sure he'll never make something of himself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aniya's face instantly darkened, her hands on her hips as she fired back, "There's an old saying, 'You can tell someone's future by the age of three.' I've seen through Darian from the start. He's always driving that beat-up truck hauling goods&mdash;how much money can he really make?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You really think this guy will ever amount to anything? Think again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Look at Director Rollins' son. He's already a department manager at Golden Group, making over a million dollars a year. That's more than Darian could earn in ten lifetimes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And just so you know, this is none of your business."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus smiled wryly. "A million a year, huh? Is it really that big of a deal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aniya and Ramona exchanged a look, both of them smirking. "Oh, sure. You probably think you can make Darian a millionaire, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus ignored their jabs and turned to Darian. "What's going on with your son? Can you tell me more?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian explained the situation in detail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His son had a severe congenital heart condition, one that could only be controlled with medication.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If the medication was stopped, the condition would relapse and could even be life-threatening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a result, their son had spent most of his life in and out of the hospital, with Ramona's younger sister, Kiera, taking care of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Here's what we're going to do," Marcus said firmly. "Take me to the hospital. I'll treat your son, and I'll also help you with your job situation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing Darian's struggles, Marcus was resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian had the kind of character that made Marcus want to help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian's eyes narrowed in confusion. "Mr. Fitzgerald, do you know any doctors?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hadn't expected Marcus to say he was going to treat his son himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Both Aniya and Ramona gave Marcus a skeptical look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While their family wasn't rich, they had spent nearly every penny they had trying to treat their son. They'd seen the best doctors in Solomia, but nothing had worked beyond managing the condition with meds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Experts from Kingston who had noticed this case had even held a special consultation for their son's condition, but no one had been able to offer a solution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So when Marcus said he could help, neither Aniya nor Ramona had any faith in him. Even Darian couldn't hold on to any hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You'll see for yourself when we get there," Marcus replied confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Reluctantly, Darian nodded. "Alright, I'll take you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I want to go see Cal too," Ramona said quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They'd been working non-stop lately and hadn't visited their son in days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she and Darian divorced, she wouldn't be able to see him as often.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aniya sighed heavily. "I've told you a hundred times, that kid's nothing but a burden. He's born to drain you dry. If you don't toughen up, you'll be stuck with him forever!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Ramona wasn't backing down, and the woman finally relented. "Fine, let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian's son, Cal, was in the ICU at Solomia Hospital, in critical care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, where are the specialists you brought?" Darian asked as they stood outside the ICU. "I'll talk to the nurse and let them know so the specialists can check on my son, but the ICU is very strict. Only half an hour at a time. Hope that's okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian didn't expect anything to come of it&mdash;he was only humoring Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There are no specialists. I'll treat your son myself," Marcus said, calm and confident.</span></p></div>
