        <h1>Chapter 865 Breakthrough to Acquired State Three!-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waves of Numinous Energy coursed through Marcus' energy channels, eventually converging in the energy sea within his Spirit Core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tiny point of light, no larger than a bean, continued to hover inside his Spirit Core, emitting a faint glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This fragment of soul belonged to someone from the Ancient Land of Anak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had temporarily taken refuge within Marcus' Spirit Core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had confirmed the stranger's words through careful observation over time. The soul fragment did not threaten his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It merely occupied a minuscule space within his Spirit Core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Focusing his mind, Marcus began channeling the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire to refine the absorbed Numinous Energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to his previous experience, the refinement process came naturally to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The abundance of Numinous Energy in his opponent's body presented a unique challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The refinement process stretched on for five grueling hours before reaching completion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After fully processing the Numinous Energy, Marcus achieved a breakthrough, advancing to Acquired State Three!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His power had ascended to an entirely new level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whew..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus exhaled deeply, gradually releasing his hold on the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' complexion glowed with vitality as his aura surged like a boundless ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After absorbing their Numinous Energy, Marcus had reached new heights in his Wizard abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had now attained the rank of a Level Seven Wizard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this magical achievement still paled in comparison to his warrior prowess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet even so, he stood among the elite spellcasters in the magical realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that taken care of, Marcus emptied the Spatial Rings he'd claimed from the two Return Essence stage warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He methodically cataloged each item he found.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rings contained various pills, crystals, amulets, weapons, treasures, and currency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While searching through one of the Spatial Rings, he discovered a journal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The journal contained detailed records of its owner's recent movements and activities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The owner was identified as Damien Caldwell, an ancient figure in the world of </span><span>Uswad</span><span> Ancient Martial Arts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the journal entries, this man had walked the earth for over a thousand years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That equated to ten complete cycles of samsara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The journal meticulously documented Damien's journey of cultivation and advancement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It chronicled his progression from novice warrior through the Foundation Establishment Stage until he reached the Return Essence stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He eventually rose to fame as a Stellar Lord in the world of Ancient Martial Arts in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The records documented every detail meticulously, making it essentially a biographical chronicle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the notes, Damien had made three attempts to explore the </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall region.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had tried to uncover the mysteries of the </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall and venture into the world beyond it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, all three attempts failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Additionally, the chronicles recorded an incident where the space-time gate at the </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall lost control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This phenomenon occurred at Damien's training ground about 1,000 years ago and lasted several decades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During these decades, people from the outside world constantly invaded the known world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These invaders acted without restraint, wreaking havoc through murder and destruction across the known world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The known world endured decades of turmoil because of their actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather eventually quelled the upheaval by gathering experts from around the known world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then sealed off the space-time gate at </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From that moment on, Godfather rose to the pinnacle of the known world, becoming a figure whom all living beings looked up to with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus continued to flip through the pages, he uncovered more of Damien's secrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprisingly, he discovered Damien had even documented this operation in his notes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damien's objectives for this mission were straightforward.</span></p></div>
