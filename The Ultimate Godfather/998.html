  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie's heart was filled with struggles and guilt toward Yasser.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that Yasser had feelings for her. Except for that time when he tried to force himself upon her, Yasser treated her very well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was always kind to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Also, it was only natural for him to have the desire for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To think about it now, Gertie could fully understand Yasser.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them had established their relationship for over a hundred years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this period, they had experienced some ups and downs, but their relationship had grown even better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser was a normal man. Having the desire for his fianc&eacute;e was the most normal thing, wasn't it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Gertie was too persistent about her virginity, so she refused Yasser.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that she thought about it, she wished she hadn't refused him in the first place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She might have felt a lot less guilty if she had given her first time to Yasser and then been molested by Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, faced with Yasser's repeated questions, Gertie could only casually prevaricate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't know how to answer him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser seemed to sense something amiss with Gertie and asked, "Gertie, your cultivation has broken through. But why do I feel that you're not very happy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What exactly happened? You can tell me. I'm your fianc&eacute;. Your problems are also mine, and I will not shirk my responsibility!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie immediately shook her head and replied, "It's nothing. Nothing's wrong with me. I've just broken through my cultivation, and my body hasn't gotten used to it yet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing her explanation, Yasser believed it and stopped pursuing the topic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Marcus returned to the Bayside Villa, he felt a very familiar aura approaching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked out of the villa and quickly rose into the void, only to see a gorgeous woman appear in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Ada, the Saintess of the Celestial Arc Order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you here for? Do you miss me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked with a smile and pulled Ada into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada's body trembled, and she struggled slightly. But Marcus' big hands held her tightly, so she gave up struggling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a look of guilt on her face, she said to Marcus, "Marcus, my cousin Gertie came to visit the Celestial Arc Order some time ago. I told her everything about us. You won't blame me, will you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus immediately understood the purpose of Ada's visit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She came to apologize out of guilt because she had revealed the secret between the two of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't. As long as you don't think there's a problem, I certainly have no problem with it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada's face still bore a trace of guilt as she said, "Tell you what, Gertie is straightforward, righteous, and has a very direct personality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have a very good rapport, and we're closer than real sisters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When she found out about what you did to me, she was immediately angry and wanted to take revenge on you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was afraid she might cause you trouble, so I do regret telling her about us..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus patted Ada's back and comforted her, "Don't worry about it. It's nothing. Since you two are close, I understand if you want to share things."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Marcus. If Gertie comes to cause you trouble, please don't take it to heart, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada raised her face and said to Marcus, her voice extremely soft and tender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She and Marcus had experienced a lot recently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been completely subdued by Marcus' incredible power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition, Marcus' talent in bed truly made Ada unable to resist.</span></p><div class="pagination">
