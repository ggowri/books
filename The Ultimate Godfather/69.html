  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, don't do this. I'm so scared." Yvonne let out a low gasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had no intention of stopping. His hand slid down Yvonne's legs and caressed her buttocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne seemed to be more sensitive than those girls Marcus had met.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment his hand touched Yvonne's buttocks, her body twitched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus' kiss deepened, Yvonne's resistance became weaker and weaker. Finally, she began to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want you," whispered Marcus in Yvonne's ear with an ambiguous look in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne's face was rosy, and her eyes, when she looked at Marcus, were full of tenderness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I can have sex with you but not here," said Yvonne, mustering up the courage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, she regretted it and was too shy to even look at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus held Yvonne's hand and walked out of the alley. "With your words, you will be mine from now on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne kept her head down the whole time, but she actually said after a moment, "Why don't you go to my home? There's no one now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus followed Yvonne to her home and then grabbed Yvonne's hips and hugged her to his chest just as he entered the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne's heart was pounding, and she was extremely nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While kissing her, Marcus unbuttoned Yvonne's clothes, revealing her delicate and tender skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Touched by Marcus, Yvonne quickly fell into endless desire and kept letting out low gasps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus pulled off Yvonne's bra and directly took her nipple into his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne took a deep breath instinctively. She had never experienced this feeling before. In an instant, she felt her whole body was like an electric current flowing through it, both exciting and refreshing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus pressed Yvonne down on the sofa, sucking her soft breasts desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne's body kept swinging, and the depths of her vagina were already wet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus quickly took off his clothes and wanted to get straight to the point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go back to my bedroom," said Yvonne with the remaining rationality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Marcus' huge manhood, she felt scared, excited, and a bit expectant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded and carried Yvonne into her bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before the two could take any further action, the door of the villa was opened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yvonne, are you home?" Emily's voice sounded outside the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Yvonne felt that all the lust that had accumulated in her heart had disappeared instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My mom is back. Hurry up and get dressed." She instinctively jumped off the bed and hurriedly sorted out her clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' movements were highly agile as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Emily pushed the door open, the two had just put on their messy clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, Marcus." Emily was a little surprised to see Marcus here. She looked at the two and then looked at the light-colored bra left on the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As someone who had experienced this, Emily naturally understood what had just happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she did not point it out but said, "Yvonne, why didn't you tell me about Marcus' coming? I could go home and cook for you two."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne wanted to hide herself. She also found her bra and said calmly, "Mom, we came back temporarily and have already eaten outside. You don't have to worry about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily smiled, "That's good. I was worried that Marcus would be hungry. Okay, you two can chat. I will go and do other things."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Emily turned and left, giving Yvonne a knowing smile before leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "My daughter has grown up and is in love. I'm truly happy for her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily was very open-minded about such a thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been young once and had desires and impulses for certain things, so she naturally could understand Yvonne and Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily thought, "Young people are full of energy and love to do that. Yvonne has to go through this sooner or later. Now that she has met the right person, she can do whatever she wants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if something goes wrong, the worst that can happen is that she can get married and have children."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this thought, Emily quietly left the villa, creating an opportunity for Marcus and Yvonne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all your fault for being so impatient." Seeing Emily leave, Yvonne glared at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was helpless and said, "Didn't you tell me to come here just now? Why do you blame me now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne put her hands on her waist. "I don't care. It's your fault. You are a bad guy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was helpless, thinking, "Women really change their expressions faster than turning the pages of a book."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne leaned gently on Marcus' shoulder and asked, "You are so skilled. Tell me. Do you have many women?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't know how to answer. Then, Yvonne blinked her big eyes and said, "I have guessed it a long time ago. A man as outstanding as you must be very popular. It is also the reason why I didn't agree to be your girlfriend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus held Yvonne in his arms and gently stroked her hair without saying a word.</span></p><div class="pagination">
