  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Bob so agitated, Joan and her thugs were taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bob, are you sure you haven't mistaken someone? There are only a few people in Solomia who deserve your respect, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tall thug felt that Bob was acting strangely today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as soon as he finished speaking, Bob kicked him in the stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a loud thud, the 6.3-foot-tall man was sent sprawling to the ground, wincing in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! How dare you disrespect Mr. Fitzgerald? You're asking for death!" Bob growled viciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could give the order, several members of Serpent's Coil had already rushed forward, pummeling the man with their fists and feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having spent years in the underworld, they were merciless in their assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, he was left with a swollen face and multiple fractures and was screaming in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you're from Serpent's Coil, you shouldn't just go around beating people. Do you know who my husband is? If you beat up his men, he'll make sure you pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joan was also frightened by the scene unfolding before her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had thought that bringing so many thugs would easily take care of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Serpent's Coil had suddenly intervened, and they seemed to hold Marcus in high regard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in Joan's eyes, Lonnie was almost like an omnipotent deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the infamous Serpent's Coil should be no match for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bitch, who the hell do you think you are, threatening me? What's your husband, some big shot? You're really asking for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bob had a fiery temper and couldn't tolerate threats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slapped Joan across the face so hard that he knocked out her teeth. Blood gushed from her nose, and she wailed in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, the man beside Joan could no longer contain himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled out his gun and aimed it at Bob's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before he could fire, one of Bob's men shot him in the head, splattering blood and brains all over Joan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joan screamed in terror, and her face turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bob sneered, "Damn it! Overestimating yourselves. When I had a gun, you were still playing with toy guns!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He instructed his men, "Beat this bitch up! Kill her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guys quickly obeyed, rushing forward to brutally beat Joan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Accustomed to a pampered life, Joan had never experienced such rough violence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was soon beaten to the point of unconsciousness, crying out in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gruesome scene also terrified Jade. She covered her eyes with her hands, unable to watch any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had heard before that Serpent's Coil was ruthless and killed without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed they were even more ferocious than rumored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These people were not only brutal but also acted without any regard for consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joan clearly had connections, yet they didn't care. They would make anyone who crossed them pay the most painful price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Joan was covered in injuries. She cried out to Marcus for mercy, "Mr. Fitzgerald, please spare me. I didn't know your identity. Please forgive me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't even glance at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bob approached and respectfully asked Marcus again, "Mr. Fitzgerald, what should we do next?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, with just a word from Marcus, they would storm Joan's home and take Lonnie out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll handle the rest. You can go back now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't want Serpent's Coil involved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Serpent's Coil was already high-profile enough in Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they openly killed the oil tycoon, it would trigger a series of chain reactions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That wasn't the outcome Marcus wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bob could only nod in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he looked at the thugs Joan had brought and said, "Take this bitch back. Tell your boss not to provoke Mr. Fitzgerald again, and don't even think about revenge. Otherwise, even if Mr. Fitzgerald doesn't pursue it, we can easily take out your boss!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guys listened to Bob in silence, too intimidated to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As thugs, most of them were former soldiers or athletes from martial arts clubs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought they were tough enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But today, seeing the underworld's desperadoes, they finally understood that the most fearsome were those who feared nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the strongest would fear those who didn't care about dying.</span></p><div class="pagination">
