  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josiah, a headless corpse, was still trying to launch a deadly attack on Marcus!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus reached out and grabbed, and directly inserted his palm into Josiah's body, abruptly cutting out the mechanical devices in his body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josiah screamed miserably, and his body fell. His mechanical device was destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body was shrouded in a burst of white smoke, and it didn't take long to burn automatically!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Abel looked extremely gloomy and was scared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to turn and run away, but Marcus wouldn't give him a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus just moved forward and stopped Abel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abel looked flustered and said, "Uswadian people, if you dare to touch me, the Black Hawk Legion will not let you go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't listen to him at all. He punched again, and Abel's head exploded!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, he launched the second attack and shattered the mechanical device in Abel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, several other cyborgs in the data center seemed to have been given instructions remotely and fled quickly toward the door of the data center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus took out Diana's modified submachine gun and quickly pulled the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several beams of destruction bloomed from the muzzle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rumble of cracking sounds was heard. Under the attack of submachine guns, a few cyborg's bodies were directly broken, wrapped in flames, and they completely lost their vitality!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, all the people of Black Hawk Legion who attempted to attack the information database of Solomia were killed on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Including the leaders, Abel and Josiah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was stunned and looked at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially Oliver, his eyes were full of disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He considered himself as odyssey's individual combat capability, and created a single man to kill 88 warriors in the Middle East battlefield, taking the brilliant record of the enemy generals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the battle with Abel, he was completely abused by the other side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But powerful semi-mechanical monsters like Abel and Josiah are vulnerable in front of this young man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other party just blasted off a few punches at will, Abel and Abel Josiah was directly destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, the other side took out the submachine gun handle, and the power was even more amazing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole process took less than 5 minutes, and Abel and Josiah were killed by Marcus!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such strength completely blocked the mouth of someone in the place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially those swat team members who have been questioning Marcus before, one by one, staring at the boss, like watching a monster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you all right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus walked to the front of Maxine to pull each other up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's beautiful eyes flashed, knowing that she was wrong about Marcus, and asked, "During the time when you disappeared before, did you kill the elite team of the other side?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded faintly and said, "Abel and Josiah were so confident because they can continuously input cyborgs into the data center through tunnels."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They lured you into the data center by way of bait."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I'll have a mantis to catch cicadas and yellowbirds and wipe them all out here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes sparkled with sharpness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, all the people present understand that the person who really controls the overall situation is not Oliver, nor the international mercenary leader like Abel and Josiah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the young man who had been criticized by them before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They suddenly recalled a scene that happened in the Strategic Deployment Office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus appeared, many people were ashamed to associate with this layman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was nonsense to think that Brenden let a person who was not a police officer take part in this operation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no one expected that it was because of Marcus' joining that he turned the tide, not only successfully slaying Abel Josiah, but also saving all their lives!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Death, he really looks like a statue of death, it's so powerful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, there was such a voice in the team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The title of death, in this particular environment, seems to be very suitable for this young man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please receive my respect!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Oliver came along and gave Marcus a deep gift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver, the youngest general in Uswad, bowed down to Marcus in front of someone in the place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew that Oliver was proud, but he was impressed by Marcus' powerful strength at the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't have to do this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved at Oliver and didn't care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I mistook you before. Please forgive me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver said apologetically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He now realized there was always someone stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He, the so-called god of war, was nothing in front of Marcus!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said I don't blame any of you, so don't mention it again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved at Oliver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he walked outside the data center and left a message, "Tell Mr. Wilde to let people come and clean up the battlefield!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he stepped out of the data center, leaving everyone with a dull look!</span></p><div class="pagination">
