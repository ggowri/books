  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many people scoffed and they believed Marcus' 60 million dollars was down to the drain. Even Cooke thought the hope was slim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not to mention the staff who sold the materials to Marcus before. He did not even want to watch the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, with the gradual deepening of the chainsaw, a burst of faint golden light emanated from the saw blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, it was accompanied by a strong wave of energy fluctuations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is that a..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone couldn't help but squint their eyes, and their faces were filled with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is there really an energy crystal in this material?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It can be! How could it be impossible? That pauper is cheated for sure. His 60 million dollars are supposed to be down the drain!" Camila and Jennifer whispered to each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the chainsaw penetrated deep, the golden light became brighter and brighter. Then a powerful energy wave swept across the entire place!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone present could feel the impact of that energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one was calm at this point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The stone was divided into two parts, except for the ordinary rock structure with a skin of about 0.4 inches, which was filled with the golden energy crystal inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, judging by its appearance, no flaw was found and it was believed to be the best energy crystal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More importantly, the energy fluctuations emitted by this energy crystal could be considered the most significant in today's event!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even those raw crystals that cost tens of billions of dollars could not be compared with Marcus' seemingly unremarkable material!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How is it possible? How can it be? How can there be such a powerful energy crystal in this crappy stone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Camila froze. Disbelief was written all over her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jennifer stood there motionless. She thought she was having hallucinations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the staff couldn't help but widen his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This stone had been here for almost two years and he even used to sit on it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And he almost threw away the stone because he found it annoying. Who would have known there was such a perfect energy crystal hidden inside?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>60 million dollars for a perfect stone? He should've asked for more!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He now regretted it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sir. Mr. Fitzgerald. This energy crystal is so good. Its value is at least 20 billion dollars. I am truly impressed!" Cooke said with excitement and looked at Marcus with more admiration in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus waved his hand. "That's just my luck. It's not worth mentioning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Truman's eyes flickered, and his face was gloomy. He didn't expect Marcus to have such good luck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Truman was just a little shocked and was looking forward to his material.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his opinion, even if his material was not ranked first in the audience, it could at least make it into the top three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if the quality of the energy crystal produced by Marcus' choice of that material far exceeded people's imagination, it could not be compared to his material.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the volume difference between the two materials was too large to be compared at all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Camila, that guy's just lucky with a good stone. The material from Mr. Dupont is what truly worth looking forward to!" Jennifer said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Camila nodded vigorously, filled with anticipation for Truman's materials. She hoped to use this material to prove Marcus' failure!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The masters of stone excavation in Southern Market had decades of experience, and their techniques were quite professional and efficient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In just less than 5 minutes, they cut Marcus' energy crystal and evenly divided it into blocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus directly put them in the Spatial Ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>According to his estimation, these energy crystals could modify at least ten guns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could accept a price of 60 million dollars to modify ten guns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, it would be Truman's turn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many people were beginning to look forward to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' piece of material looked very poor in appearance, but it could produce so many energy crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This might mean that the quality of the stones placed here today was quite high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If that were the case, then stones with better appearances would produce better energy crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>According to this logic, they should indeed look forward to Truman's piece of stone more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Truman, Camila, and Jennifer all thought so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the sound of the chainsaw rang again, and two masters of stone excavation joined forces to cut Truman's stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The chainsaw deepened and soon cut into a depth of about 2 inches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was extremely hopeful, but there was no energy fluctuation as they had imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When the masters cut Marcus' piece of material to this depth before, the energy fluctuations were already quite strong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Truman's face darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry, Mr. Dupont. Our material is stronger than that pauper in terms of appearance and volume. If the masters cut a little further, energy crystal will appear," Camila consoled Truman.</span></p><div class="pagination">
