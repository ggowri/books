  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wh</span><span>y</span><span> are you following me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the look of admiration in Chloe's eyes, Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you take me home? You were the one who took me home last time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe's eyes sparkled, and there was a hint of expectation on her face as she spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus frowned and was a little speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before this, he could clearly feel that Chloe had always been indifferent toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never expected her to suddenly act so clingy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What, you don't want to? If you don't want to, I can just take a cab home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, Marcus was silent. Chloe bit her lip, and disappointment flashed in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not that I don't want to. It's just that you </span><span>have </span><span>change</span><span>d</span><span> </span><span>so much</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I </span><span>have </span><span>changed so much?</span><span> How?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe blinked, a bit surprised by his comment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before, you definitely wouldn't have asked me to take you home," Marcus said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe blushed slightly and responded, "That's because you were Lila's boyfriend, so I... I just..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus froze for a moment, then looked at Chloe with an odd expression. "But I'm still Lila's boyfriend. That hasn't changed, so it seems like you're the one who's changed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe was taken aback by Marcus' sharp response and couldn't figure out how to respond at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't </span><span>be nervous</span><span>. I'm just kidding. Of course, I can take you home. It's no big deal. Let's get in the car!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time he finished speaking, they had already arrived at the underground parking lot. Marcus opened the door to his Aston Martin and sat in the driver's seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe, biting her lip, opened the passenger door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was her first time sitting in Marcus' car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the luxurious interior, Chloe couldn't help but feel impressed. She asked him, "I </span><span>notice that</span><span> rich second-generation kids usually like Ferraris or Lamborghinis. Why did you buy this less popular brand? I think it shows your good taste."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I liked watching the 007</span><span> serires</span><span> movies when I was a kid. James Bond was my idol. Buying this car is like fulfilling a childhood dream."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus explained calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another reason was that he didn't like flashy cars, and the Aston Martin fit his personality perfectly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they spoke, Marcus started the car, and the V8 engine let out a thrilling roar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound echoed in the underground garage, becoming even more intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Marcus drove the car out of the garage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, your passenger seat has been occupied by a lot of women, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the way, Chloe asked Marcus another question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled, "If I told you that aside from Lila, you're the first, would you believe me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe immediately pouted. "You're such a liar. A man as impressive as you couldn't possibly only have one woman around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've heard from Lila before that you're not just with her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus felt speechless. It seemed like women loved sharing everything, especially private matters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next time he saw Lila, Marcus was definitely going to have a talk with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, your passenger seat must have been occupied by a lot of beautiful women."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe said, looking at him with her beautiful eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't explain. He knew that would only make things worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe lived in Sunridge Estates, a mid-range neighborhood in Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What confused Marcus was that although Chloe was one of the top 12 rising stars and had just released a hit song, Midnight Serenade, she still gave him the impression of someone poor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a star at her level, it was strange that she didn't even own a private car.</span></p><div class="pagination">
