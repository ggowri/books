  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a grand welcome for Gertie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie had no desire to attend, but Yasser insisted, dragging her to the event.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gertie, Yasser is still young and impulsive. If he has offended you, please don't hold it against him," Brett said apologetically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes rested on Gertie, filled with regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the Tucker family was one of the most prestigious Ancient Martial Art families in Uswad, and Yasser, as the young master, had no shortage of women vying for his attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie was different. She possessed the Exquisite Body, and if Yasser could unite with her, he would master the Tucker family's ultimate cultivation manual, the Nine Revolutions Return to One.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This would propel Yasser's strength to new heights, potentially allowing him to reach the Return Essence stage in a remarkably short time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Considering Yasser had only lived through one samsara, reaching the Return Essence stage would make his future limitless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this required Yasser to consummate his union with Gertie while she remained a virgin, thereby obtaining her Exquisite Body to perfect the Nine Revolutions Return to One.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brett had waited decades for this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Yasser had reached the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Nine, and Gertie had just broken through to the peak of the same level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The time he had been waiting for seemed to have finally arrived!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie waved her hand. "Mr. Brett Tucker, it's not Yasser's fault. I just haven't been able to overcome my own barriers yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't expected Brett to bring up such a private matter so openly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the room was filled with the Tucker family's most esteemed elders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Discussing such intimate matters in front of them made Gertie deeply uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, she felt a growing resentment toward Yasser.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite having lived through a samsara, he still acted like a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what happened between them, Yasser would immediately report it to his father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when his attempt to consummate their relationship had failed, Yasser had told Brett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This left Gertie feeling as if she had no privacy, and Brett's public mention of the matter at the banquet only deepened her embarrassment, though she had no choice but to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From Brett's perspective, however, it was a different story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had long hoped for his son to reach the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Nine and obtain Gertie's Exquisite Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This would allow Yasser to perfect the Nine Revolutions Return to One and ascend to the Return Essence stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For decades, this goal had become an obsession for Brett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He saw no issue in discussing it openly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Brett's gaze swept over Gertie. "With all the elders of the Tucker family present today, I would like to discuss something with you, Gertie."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie raised an eyebrow. "Mr. Brett Tucker, please speak freely. If it's within my power, I won't refuse."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brett said, "You and Yasser have been engaged for over a decade. Now that both of you have broken through to the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Nine, I believe it's time for you to marry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once you're married, I will pass the position of family head to Yasser. You, Gertie, will become the young mistress of the Tucker family, sharing all its resources with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words were met with immediate approval from the other elders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They, too, had long awaited Yasser's marriage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the young master of the Tucker family, he had always been the center of attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once married and united with Gertie's Exquisite Body, Yasser's status would soar to new heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the hundreds of Ancient Martial Art families in the Kinton Mountains, the Tucker family would rise to unparalleled prominence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the shared ambition of all the Tucker family's elders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, as soon as Brett finished speaking, the room erupted with enthusiastic support from the elders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser's eyes gleamed with anticipation as he looked at Gertie, eagerly awaiting her agreement.</span></p><div class="pagination">
