Yvonne was the perfect candidate for the job.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles was overjoyed and immediately agreed, saying, "Of course, no problem! But, Mr. Fitzgerald, since Yvonne will be marrying you, we're practically family now, so we don't need to be so meticulous about the profits, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied, "Even families settle accounts clearly. Besides, your company will be merging with ours, and Yvonne will be involved in the operations going forward. The forty percent profit is rightfully yours, so there's no need to refuse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles finally agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne, naturally, had no reason to decline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been developing her career abroad, but ever since meeting Marcus, she had no desire to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the pharmaceutical company nearly set up, Marcus had completed a major task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finalizing the plans, it was already past ten o'clock in the evening. Marcus, exhausted, returned to the Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he opened the door, Natalia, dressed in a black sheer nightgown, rushed into his arms. "Marcus, you're finally home. I've missed you so much..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught by surprise, Marcus was knocked onto the couch by Natalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She straddled him, leaning down to kiss him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahem... Ahem..." A sudden cough interrupted them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus suddenly noticed that Diana was sitting nearby, typing away on her laptop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia certainly didn't care who was around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Natalia, get off me, you're crushing me," Marcus said, trying to push her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, are you implying I'm getting fat? I guess I'll have to start dieting," Natalia said with a pout, raising her long leg and stepping off him. She then grabbed a dumbbell from across the room and started exercising.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's not what I meant, I just want you to get up quickly," Marcus hurriedly explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia set the dumbbell down. "Marcus, don't you miss me? Why can't I feel anything at all?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus answered indifferently, "I do miss you, but a man's missing is invisible, so you can't feel it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Typical bad boy quote!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia stuck out her tongue at him. "Marcus, I never knew you could talk so sweetly. Looks like you've fooled quite a few girls, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't want to argue with her, so he gave a casual response and went back to his room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly hopped into the shower, eager to enjoy a well-deserved, peaceful night's sleep. However, as soon as he slipped into bed, he felt something soft and smooth shifting under the covers. Before he could react, it coiled around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Darling... I've missed you so much... You haven't fucked me in days..." came Jane's sultry voice from beneath the sheets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus let out a sigh of resignation. Even when he wanted to rest, there seemed to be no escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to get away, but Jane pinned him firmly to the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She just put his dick in her mouth and started sucking it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A shiver ran down his spine, but he didn't dare make a sound&mdash;Natalia and Diana were just outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't believe Jane had the audacity to pull something like this, especially since Natalia still had no idea about their relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane, it seemed, had grown far more skilled in her blow job techniques during their time together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a few seconds, Marcus felt the pleasure, and his penis stood up and became extremely hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's down there was wet, and she just sat down on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a "puff" sound, Marcus felt his dick being wrapped in wetness, which was indescribably refreshing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane moved up and down frantically, with an expression of extreme ecstasy on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she did not make a big fuss, but covered her mouth with her hands to prevent herself from making any sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them looked like a couple having an affair as they had to be sneaky to do such a thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, under such circumstances, it only heightened the sense of thrill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he noticed Jane was trying to hold her groan, Marcus's desire was completely aroused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He simply took her dangling breast into his mouth, sucking it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane couldn't help but let out a groan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she quickly covered her mouth, afraid that the sound would be heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus...what are you doing in the room? Why do I seem to hear a woman's voice?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
