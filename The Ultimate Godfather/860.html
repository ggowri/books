  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus could tell right away&mdash;Jade clearly didn't come to Kingston of her own will. It was a direct order from the hospital, leaving her with no choice but to obey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade quickly filled Marcus in on the situation, confirming what he had already suspected. She had been assigned by the hospital's higher-ups to collaborate with the newly hired Vice President, Ronald, and his private team to negotiate a deal with </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span>. As part of this, she had attended a party.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was where Aiden Nelson, the son of </span><span>MedicaGenix's</span><span> president, took an interest in her&mdash;though "interest" was putting it lightly. Throughout the night, he repeatedly made inappropriate advances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Disgusted, Jade had tried to leave the party. But Ronald and his team had chased after her, pressuring her to go back and entertain Aiden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason? Simple. Aiden had made it clear&mdash;if Jade didn't return to the party and drink with him, </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span> wouldn't prioritize supplying pharmaceuticals to </span><span>Solomia</span><span> Hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronald, fresh from </span><span>Acoton</span><span> and eager to establish himself as VP, saw this deal as his golden ticket. Securing it would cement his position. Failing, however, would mean an uphill battle to maintain his authority, especially since several department heads were eyeing his role.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only reason Ronald had landed the VP spot in the first place was his impressive surgical expertise in </span><span>Acoton</span><span>. Now, under immense pressure, he had resorted to forcing Jade into compliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Jade wasn't about to give in. That was how she ended up in the scene Marcus had witnessed in the taxi moments ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And who the hell are you? You think you can meddle in our business?" Ronald's eyes turned icy as he took in Marcus' stance&mdash;one that all but screamed "knight in shining armor".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>He's</span><span> my boyfriend. Marcus." Jade beat Marcus to the punch, her voice suddenly steadier, stronger&mdash;like she had just found solid ground to stand on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronald's eyes narrowed. "Funny. I don't recall hearing anything about you having a boyfriend. Where'd this guy come from?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade rolled her eyes. "Oh, please, Mr. Hughes. Since when were we close enough for me to update you on my personal life?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronald's face darkened. Taking a deep breath, he tried again, voice dripping with forced patience. "Boyfriend or not, you represent </span><span>Solomia</span><span> Hospital. That means you should put the hospital's interests first. Mr. Nelson wants to drink with you&mdash;it's an honor, not an option. Like it or not, you're going back in there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he subtly signaled to his team. The men who had been standing behind him immediately sprang into action&mdash;loyal and well-trained under Ronald's command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them stepped forward, reaching out to grab Jade's wrist. But before his fingers </span><span>could make contact, Marcus' hand clamped around his wrist like a vice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's eyes flickered with surprise, then turned cold. "Listen, kid. This isn't something you </span><span>wanna</span><span> get involved in. If you know what's good for you, back off. Otherwise, boyfriend or not, we won't be giving you any special treatment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others took a step closer, surrounding Marcus. Marcus swept his gaze over them and let out a slow, mocking smile. "Oh? And what exactly are you planning to do? Use force?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men exchanged glances. "And if we do, what are you </span><span>gonna</span><span> do about it?" Their smug expressions made it clear&mdash;they thought they had Marcus outnumbered, backed into a corner with no way out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment stretched just long enough for one of them to throw the first punch. But before his fist could land, Marcus countered with his own. A solid thud echoed in the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strangled cry ripped from the man's throat as he was sent flying backward. Blood spurted from his mouth&mdash;his molars </span><span>shattered,</span><span> his face twisted in agony. The others froze, shock flickering across their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronald clenched his teeth. "You little punk... I was going to give you a chance, but you clearly don't know your place. Fine. Don't blame me for what happens next." With a sharp wave of his hand, he ordered his men to attack. They lunged at Marcus all at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus barely spared them a glance. With a casual shift of his stance, he dodged their blows and retaliated with effortless precision. In mere seconds, the sounds of fists meeting flesh filled the air&mdash;followed by groans of pain. One by one, Ronald's men hit the ground, writhing and groaning in defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronald's eyes widened. He hadn't expected this&mdash;hadn't expected him. And now, Marcus' gaze was locked onto him. Ronald's body stiffened involuntarily. Even at 6.3 feet, towering over most men, he felt a shiver of fear creep down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus took a slow step toward him. Then another. Ronald found himself backing away until his back hit a wall. His face paled. "What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smirked, "Take a wild guess."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached out, grabbing Ronald by the collar. Ronald struggled, but Marcus' grip was unyielding. "You'd better let me go, or I'll kill you." Panic setting in, Ronald swung his fist to Marcus' face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus scoffed, meeting it head-on with his own. A sharp cry of pain rang out as Ronald's wrist </span><span>snapped,</span><span> his bones crushed under the impact. Cold sweat broke out across his forehead. His knees nearly buckled. "Bastard!" he gasped, voice shaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't even blink. With one swift motion, he drove a kick into Ronald's stomach. Ronald doubled over, curling up on the ground like a wounded shrimp, howling in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade, watching from a few feet away, was momentarily stunned. She had not expected Marcus to be this violent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronald, however, was still seething, even </span><span>through</span><span> the pain. "You think you can get away with this? You're </span><span>gonna</span><span> regret&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had lived and worked in </span><span>Acoton</span><span> for years, his personality as arrogant as ever. </span><span>When it came to people from back home, he carried an unspoken sense of superiority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why, until now, he had never taken Marcus seriously. But after being beaten like this, the fury in his heart had already reached its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is what you get for messing with my girlfriend. The fact that I didn't completely cripple you is me showing mercy." Marcus' voice was cold as he stared down at Ronald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a voice rang out from the entrance of the restaurant. "Well, who's being so bold? Daring to lay a hand on my business partner?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus instinctively turned toward the door, his gaze sharpening as he watched a group of people stride in from outside.</span></p><div class="pagination">
