  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you to interfere with matters of the Burnett family? You're asking for death! Take him down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elderly man was furious, his eyes gleaming with coldness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men in suits charged Marcus with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they were no match for Marcus' lightning-fast strikes. In moments, they were all knocked to the ground, writhing in pain and howling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked at the elderly man coldly. "Didn't you hear? Ms. Burnett told you to get lost. How dare a servant disobey their master?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus' power, the elderly man broke out in a cold sweat. He gritted his teeth and said, "Fine, very well. You've got guts. I'll remember you. Get ready to face the wrath of the Burnett family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the elderly man and the defeated men fled from the restaurant in disgrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, I'm really sorry. You've been interrupted during our meal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine gave Marcus an apologetic smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' display of strength once again stunned her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elderly man was the Burnett family's butler, and the men he brought were mostly retired special forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Together, they were more than a match for someone like Gibson, the half-cyborg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet despite their combined strength, they were easily defeated by Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine couldn't help but rethink her previous assessment of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She even wondered, had she not intervened that day on the plane, Marcus might have easily dealt with the hijackers by himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's fine. Let's continue eating."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved it off nonchalantly. He hadn't wanted to get involved in Maxine's family matters, but he couldn't stand by and saw them take her away forcibly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for offending the Kingston Burnett family, he wasn't worried in the slightest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What surprised him, however, was that Maxine was actually a member of the Burnett family in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Burnett family was one of the four most powerful families in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their influence spanned politics, business, and many other areas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had previously interacted with the Brown family, but they were barely in the top 20 in Kingston, and there was a huge gap between them and the Burnett family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given the truth, the Brown family held sway over all of </span><span>Uswad</span><span>. Therefore, one could easily envision the immense power of the Burnett family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus and Maxine continued their meal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine couldn't help but be surprised by Marcus' calm demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had expected him to be stunned when he learned of her true identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But judging by his reaction, it seemed like he didn't care at all about the fact that she was coming from the Burnett family and, what was more, he seemed entirely unimpressed with the Burnett family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Could it be that he is pretending to be calm?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Kingston Burnett family was so powerful that even she, as Ms. Burnett, was in awe of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Hudson family in Eldoria wielded significant influence worldwide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Burnett family's power, however, likely surpassed theirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After their meal, Marcus drove Maxine back to the Solomia Special Police Academy. When Maxine left, he called Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Check on Pete's whereabouts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Fitzgerald!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana responded immediately, and within five minutes, she sent Marcus the details. "Pete is currently in the VIP 306 room of the Orthopedic Department at Solomia Hospital."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes narrowed. He hung up and headed straight for Solomia Hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still no news from Brel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Solomia Hospital's VIP 306 room, Pete asked irritably, clearly agitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No news yet, Mr. Hudson. But with Brel's strength and Chetak's help, it's a sure thing. Marcus is probably already dead," The man reported.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pete nodded. "Leave me alone. I need to rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man immediately exited the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Minutes later, the door opened again, and someone in a white coat and mask entered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pete, still agitated, didn't notice something was off with this new arrival. He snapped, "I told you to leave! What are you doing back here? Are you deaf?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm here to give you an injection."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice was strangely familiar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pete instinctively looked up, and then he froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus... You didn't die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Pete could finish his sentence, a syringe was plunged into his body, quickly injecting its contents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pete's body shuddered, feeling a sudden chill. A deep, inexplicable fear crept in. He instinctively asked, "What did you just inject into me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, dressed in a white coat, removed his mask and sneered. "Don't worry, it's nothing serious. It's just a sleeping drug. Soon, you'll fall asleep forever and feel no more pain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pete's blue eyes widened in terror as he struggled to call for help, but Marcus immediately pressed his hand over his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pete's body grew weaker, his vision blurred, and within moments, he lost consciousness completely...</span></p><div class="pagination">
