  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing Devon's words, Yasser suddenly felt it made some sense. After thinking for a while, he said, "In the world of the Ancient Martial Art of Uswad, who can set up such a mysterious rune?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Devon's eyes flickered again as he replied, "As far as I'm concerned, this person must be a powerful expert, and his identity must be mysterious!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser couldn't help but nod, agreeing to what Devon said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Will Gertie be in any danger?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the thought that the person who set up this rune was very likely to be a powerful figure, Yasser couldn't help but feel worried about Gertie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Devon answered, "Probably not. With that person's status and position, if he wanted to do something to Ms. Leah, he wouldn't have to rely on such a rune at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I even think Ms. Leah is very likely to have obtained some kind of opportunity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being intrigued by Devon's answer, Yasser asked curiously, "What kind of opportunity? Can you elaborate on that, Devon?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Devon stroked his beard and said, "It's very likely that that powerful expert is currently passing on his skills and teachings to Gertie. But his cultivation manuals are so mysterious and secret that they can't be known by the outside world; he has to set up an illusion rune to avoid being disturbed by people from the outside world."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Yasser suddenly agreed with Devon, and he no longer felt as worried as before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even felt happy for Gertie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she was really being passed on skills and teachings by a powerful figure, Gertie's strength would surely improve, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a thought made Yasser actually feel a faint sense of anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie was Yasser's fianc&eacute;e.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was certainly pleased if she were to obtain such an opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Yasser stopped shouting Gertie's name but waited on the spot instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it wouldn't be long before that mysterious man brought Gertie out of the illusion rune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Yasser have imagined that Gertie was indeed being passed on skills and teachings by a man?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, that man was passing his seed on her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Marcus released his dual cultivation power again, which instantly doubled the sense of pleasure for both of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, under the effect of the dual cultivation power and the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, the cultivation levels of both of them were also steadily increasing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie was improving her cultivation level while enduring an extremely intense sense of pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this time, the sense of pleasure seemed to be even stronger than the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially after having the previous experience, Gertie seemed to be more relaxed than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just the thought of Yasser being outside sent a sharp pain to Gertie's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But every time that stabbing pain in her heart rose at the thought of Yasser being outside, it would be washed away by the intense pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah... oh... um..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie couldn't stop making alluring moans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was enveloped by a huge wave of happiness, and the intense sense of stimulation filled her entire body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just about half an hour, Gertie had had three orgasms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The liquid from her lower body even soaked her thighs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus could feel the continuous contraction of the private part of Gertie's lower body, which also gave him an extremely intense sense of pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After changing several positions, Marcus finally felt that he was coming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he pressed Gertie against a cliff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He made Gertie's hands hold onto the cliff and thrust in from behind, launching the final round of attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While thrusting in and out, he also slapped Gertie's shapely buttocks.</span></p><div class="pagination">
