        <h1>Chapter 452 A Gynecological Condition</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The first time Marcus met Kiera, his attention hadn't been on her, so he hadn't noticed certain details.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, however, his gaze lingered briefly before Kiera, sensing his eyes on her, flushed a deep red. Trying to diffuse the awkwardness, she said, "Mr. Fitzgerald, please wait here. I'll go prepare dinner for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She slipped off her jacket, revealing an elegant figure as she tied on an apron.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was something comforting and wholesome about her as she smiled lightly and walked into the kitchen to start cooking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus wandered casually around the living room, taking in the space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From the decor, it was clear Kiera was someone who loved life and was very disciplined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On a chalkboard near the door, she had a detailed to-do list with neatly drawn checkmarks under completed tasks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her organization and self-discipline were remarkable, something rarely seen in everyday life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Beyond that, Kiera seemed quite frugal. Many items in her home appeared to be repurposed from old materials, creatively transformed into practical and decorative objects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was both money-saving and practical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In today's materialistic society, such ingenuity was rare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most people either lacked the skills or thought it was beneath them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Marcus' gaze fell on the dining table, he noticed several medications.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From their labels, it was clear they were for treating gynecological conditions, including uterine fibroids, ovarian cysts, and vaginitis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Given Kiera's pale complexion and her frail, undernourished appearance, Marcus deduced that her condition was likely severe, at least serious enough to require constant medication.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Kiera emerged from the kitchen, carefully carrying four dishes, which she placed on the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Noticing the medications, she quickly gathered them up, embarrassment flashing across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm afraid the food isn't very good, Mr. Fitzgerald," she said with a sweet smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew it was an honor for someone as formidable as Marcus to come to her place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus sampled one of the dishes and gave her a thumbs-up. "This is wonderful. It tastes like home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In today's world, it was rare to find a young woman who could cook, let alone prepare dishes this flavorful and well-presented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a moment, Marcus asked casually, "By the way, I noticed the medication. Are you dealing with a gynecological condition?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera froze, her cheeks turning crimson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Discussing such matters with a man was deeply embarrassing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She regretted not hiding the medicine earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes," she admitted softly. "But it's not too serious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, her illness had been torturing her for days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In truth, Kiera had been struggling recently. Her lower abdomen often ached, and her chronic anemia left her feeling dizzy and fatigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Take care of yourself," Marcus said gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had already noticed her symptoms but chose not to press further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After dinner, as Kiera began clearing the table, a sudden wave of dizziness hit her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She stumbled, nearly collapsing, but Marcus caught her just in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kiera, are you okay?" Marcus asked, his tone concerned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera rubbed her temples, forcing a smile. "I'm fine. It's probably just from the stress earlier with Gustavo and his friends."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She tried to get back to work, but Marcus held her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your anemia has worsened, and the stress caused your blood to flow abnormally, leading to your dizziness. You need to rest. No more chores."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera chuckled weakly. "Don't worry, Mr. Fitzgerald. I've felt like this before. I just need a moment to recover."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This time is different," Marcus said firmly. "Your uterine fibroids have grown severe enough to compress your cervix. If left untreated, it could lead to serious consequences, even permanent damage."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera stared at him in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She hadn't expected him to know so much just by observing her. "What should I do? Does it require surgery?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though she was frugal, Kiera always took her health seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching her nephew suffer from a congenital heart condition had made her even more cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't want to endure unnecessary pain or burden her family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing that her condition was this severe left her feeling panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Surgery carries risks and potential side effects. I wouldn't recommend it," Marcus said, shaking his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then what should I do?" Kiera asked, her voice trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I can treat your condition. The only question is whether you're willing to trust me and cooperate," Marcus replied calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His Timeless Numinous Energy had cured advanced cancer and leukemia before. A gynecological condition like this was trivial by comparison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Really?" Kiera asked, her eyes widening in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She quickly remembered how Marcus had cured her nephew's heart condition in less than half an hour and felt a wave of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What do I need to do?" she asked, her tone now filled with hope.</span></p></div>
