  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had just parked his car when a sleek white Rolls-Royce Cullinan rolled up and stopped right across from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out stepped two women and a man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was tall, sharply dressed in a suit, exuding an undeniable charisma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Jenson, Marcus and Chad's classmate from high school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By his side was a striking woman, tall with a graceful figure, her features exquisite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wore an elegant evening gown, sparkling with jewels, but it wasn't over the top.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole look was impeccably refined, stylish, and unmistakably expensive, radiating a quiet sense of wealth that caught everyone's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Chad saw her, his gaze froze, and his body began to shake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman was none other than his ex-wife, Vivian Eleanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chad, calm down," Marcus said, slapping Chad on the shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Chad tried to steady himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other woman, Natalie, was also dressed in an evening gown, looking just as stunning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While her gown wasn't as expensive as Vivian's, her beauty more than made up for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, well, look who it is!" Jenson said, strolling over confidently, hands in his pockets, the sound of his leather shoes clicking against the pavement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chad, we met again. It's been three years, and you're still the same. Can't even bother to clean yourself up for a big event like this? You look like a mess. Seriously disappointing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian's eyes turned to Chad, arms crossed, her face twisted in disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We don't have any connection anymore. Just keep to yourself and stop judging me," Chad said coldly, his heart a tangled mess of resentment and bitterness as he looked at the woman who once meant everything to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't she right, Chad?" Jenson chimed in with a smug smile. "You don't even look like someone who's had a proper education. You look so pathetic. No wonder Vivian left you for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." Chad's fists clenched, a mixture of anger and shame bubbling up. He opened his mouth to retort, but seeing how smug Jenson looked, he felt suddenly small, the words catching in his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? You still have a problem with us? I must have been blind choosing you. I wasted my best years on a man like you," Vivian said, her voice dripping with contempt as she looked at him, unashamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're Chad's ex-wife, right?" Marcus suddenly spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian turned her gaze to him, sizing him up before nodding. "Yes, that's me. And you are?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie quickly introduced, "This is Marcus Fitzgerald, our high school classmate. He and Chad were close back then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, you're the one Chad always talked about," Vivian said, her tone now a little more curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you're hanging out with someone like Chad? Guess that doesn't say much about you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, what do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sneered, his eyes sharp. "Nothing much. I just can't wrap my head around it. How does a woman like you, ungrateful and, frankly, cheap, have the nerve to lecture Chad? How shameless can you be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian's face turned crimson, her jaw tightening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't expected Marcus to speak so bluntly, especially in front of Jenson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear he had no fear of Jenson either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, are you out of your mind? Badmouthing my wife in front of me? You think I won't do anything about it?" Jenson's face hardened, his voice cold as ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze then shifted to the sleek Aston Martin behind Marcus, eyeing the car. "Is that yours?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded indifferently. "What's it to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never thought the poorest kid from school would be driving a few million-dollar car now. No wonder you're acting so cocky," Jenson said, sizing up Marcus with a knowing glance, though his expression quickly returned to its usual arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Natalie quickly told Jenson about how Marcus had spent 650 million buying all the jewelry from their store.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson chuckled darkly. "So, looks like this poor guy is rich now. But you don't really think spending 650 million on jewelry is such a big deal, do you? Well, you're mistaken. To me, 650 million is nothing. Just pocket change. But for someone like you? That might be all you have."</span></p><div class="pagination">
