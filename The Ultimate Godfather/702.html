  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite all her tough talk, Lucy was just a girl in her early twenties. Nothing in her life had prepared her for having a gun pointed at her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she lay crumpled on the floor, her body betrayed her&mdash;she lost control of her bladder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The acrid smell quickly spread through the room, drawing disgusted looks from everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucy wanted to die right there. This was beyond humiliating. How could she ever show her face in the entertainment industry again? Her social life was over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila looked at her with contempt. "You know what's crazy? Mr. Fitzgerald never did anything to you, but you kept trying to stir up trouble. I thought you were actually tough. But look at you now. What a disappointment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." Lucy's face turned ashen. For once, she had nothing to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ross, who'd been somewhat attracted to Lucy before, now couldn't hide his disgust as he watched her sitting in her own mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a crimson beam of destructive light materialized out of nowhere. In the blink of an eye, it pierced through the forehead of one of Alaric's armed men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man didn't even have time to react before his body crashed to the ground like a </span><span>fallen tree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone stumbled backward in horror, terrified they might be next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare a tiny hotel in </span><span>Solomia</span><span> interfere with my student?" An elderly voice cut through the air like ice. "You had no idea who you were dealing with."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes turned toward the source of the voice. Through the crowd emerged an old man with distinct </span><span>Southvaian</span><span> features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hair and beard were snow-white, his face deeply lined with age. But there was nothing frail about him&mdash;every step he took radiated pure power. A faint crimson light seemed to pulse around him, marking him unmistakably as a Curse Weaver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ross' face lit up instantly. "Mr. </span><span>Drakov</span><span>, you're finally here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone tensed up&mdash;nobody had expected Ross to have such a powerful teacher in his corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who knew Ross well understood the connection. He'd always been fascinated by </span><span>Southvaian</span><span> culture, thanks to growing up near the border.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since he'd turned eighteen, he'd made yearly solo trips to </span><span>Southvaia</span><span>, spending weeks there before coming home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was where he'd fallen hard for curse magic, constantly searching for masters who could teach him their craft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ross had been struggling with curse magic for ages, getting nowhere&mdash;until he met Victor </span><span>Drakov</span><span>, the old master who changed everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to Victor, Ross finally started to actually get curse magic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All those techniques and secrets he'd been missing suddenly made sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Ross looked up to Victor so much, always respecting him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ross was thrilled&mdash;just when he was backed into a corner by the Golden Hotel crew, his teacher showed up out of nowhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he didn't waste any time showing off his skills, taking out one of their armed guys with some seriously intense curse magic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ross couldn't help but stare. This was his first time seeing Victor's lethal curse magic in action, and that move was insane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If anything, it made Ross even more determined to master the path of a Curse Weaver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow as he sized up the elderly Curse Weaver, who'd suddenly showed up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Based on the curse magic he'd just witnessed, Victor had to be from the Bloodthirsty Cult. But he was only a Level Three Curse Weaver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant he wasn't exactly top-tier in the Bloodthirsty Cult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor gave Ross a calm nod before turning his cold gaze toward Marcus and Alaric from the Golden Hotel. "So," he said, "you're threatening my student? Well, if anyone else wants to die today, come on and try me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the room felt their blood run cold. This was what real power looked like&mdash;someone who could face any challenge without breaking a sweat, who didn't need to fear anyone's threats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor was the real deal&mdash;his power and his presence marked him as someone truly formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, Alaric had been bold enough to defy Ross while protecting Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, under Victor's overwhelming presence, they were in serious trouble. One wrong move would mean certain death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're from the Bloodthirsty Cult?" Marcus asked, breaking the tense silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor's face twisted into a smug grin. "That's right, kid. I'm impressed you've even heard of us." He lifted his chin, radiating arrogance. "Since you know our reputation, why don't you get down on your knees and show some respect to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several people shot </span><span>Marcus</span><span> mocking looks, clearly enjoying his predicament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. </span><span>Drakov</span><span>," Ross chimed in with a cold smile, "this guy's been nothing but trouble. He beat up a bunch of my men earlier. You need to tear him apart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ross was feeling pretty cocky now. With Victor stepping in, even the Golden Hotel's people wouldn't dare lift a finger to help Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus couldn't care less about them. Without a word, he tossed a token straight at Victor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor caught it on reflex. The moment his eyes landed on the </span><span>token,</span><span> his whole body froze. The smug look vanished from his face, replaced by raw fear.</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
