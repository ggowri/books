  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert knew that with so many people watching, arguing wouldn't do him any good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What mattered more was that the reason he was here to acquire the pharmaceutical patents was because of McHale Pharmaceuticals Group's backing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything he did had McHale's support, which gave him the confidence to face off with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as his words dropped, Marcus stepped forward and appeared directly in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert's face turned pale in an instant. A bad feeling gripped his heart. Before he could react, Marcus' massive hand locked onto his wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go of me! Let go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert struggled, but it was no use.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sickening crack, Marcus twisted his wrist, breaking it with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert screamed in agony. Never in his wildest dreams did he think Marcus would dare lay a hand on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm here representing McHale Pharmaceuticals Group. You dare lay a finger on me? Don't you care that McHale might come after you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You hurt my people and still have the nerve to threaten me? Where do you get the guts?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus slapped him across the face, shattering Albert's teeth in one brutal strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert howled in pain again, but before he could recover, Marcus slapped him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost all of Albert's teeth were gone now, his face swollen and unrecognizable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus kicked him hard, sending him crashing to the ground. He turned to the McHale representatives and coldly said, "The Golden Group Park belongs to me. All the patents here are the product of my company's research. I have no intention of selling them to anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go back and tell McHale. Don't think they can push me around with their power. If they have a problem with it, I'm more than ready to take on whatever challenge they throw at me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words hit the crowd like a bombshell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna and the others' faces drained of color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just yesterday, at Jade's birthday party, they had suffered at Marcus' hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, even though Marcus was openly flaunting his power and beating Albert in front of them, they didn't dare say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost!" Marcus snapped, signaling them to leave without a second thought. He clearly wasn't in the mood to waste any more time on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna and her team, their faces ashen, had no choice but to drag the injured Albert and leave the Golden Group Park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'd better wait. Once I'm back in Acoton, I'll report this to the chairman. I'm sure he won't let this slide. You'll feel McHale's wrath soon enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Luna exited the park, she shot a venomous glance at the building and gritted her teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert winced in pain, his face contorted. But as he saw Luna vow revenge on Marcus, a small sliver of comfort filled him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus might have saved Cecilia's life, but he'd also crossed McHale's bottom line too many times. There was no way McHale would let him keep getting away with this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The real reason they were in Uswad wasn't just for the medical seminar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were here to acquire key patents from </span><span>the </span><span>Golden Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And these patents had been an absolute game-changer in the market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were flying off the shelves in Uswad, but the real shocker was how they were outselling even McHale's own products in international markets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That kind of success couldn't go unnoticed, and McHale saw both a threat and an opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were ready to pay top dollar to buy up those patents, turning a potential threat into a massive profit boost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before their trip even started, McHale had already made this acquisition their top priority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now that Marcus had dared to stop McHale's plan, there would be consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, do you really think McHale will just let this slide?" Yvonne asked him, concern in her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave her a sharp look, his confidence unwavering. "If they dare retaliate, I'll make sure McHale disappears from this world."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words sent a cold shiver through the senior staff at Golden Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But most of them didn't take him seriously as they thought he was just bluffing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, McHale Pharmaceuticals was a global powerhouse. There was no way they could just vanish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go back to your office," Marcus said, glancing at Yvonne's swollen cheek with genuine concern. "I'll take care of that for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a simple offer, but the way his eyes lingered on her made her feel a little uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, she couldn't help but think of something else, something she wasn't sure she should even entertain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strange mix of curiosity and anticipation stirred inside her as she caught his gaze.</span></p><div class="pagination">
