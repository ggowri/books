        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She seemed more energized than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade collapsed weakly into her seat, gasping for breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was still overwhelmed by the lingering sense of relief and comfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How do you feel? Better now?" Marcus asked as he withdrew the Timeless Numinous Energy and wiped the sweat from his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade nodded weakly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a moment, she regained her composure and looked directly at Marcus. "You've seen everything&mdash;even that embarrassing moment. You have to take responsibility!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Uh..." Marcus muttered, a few beads of sweat appearing on his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' expression twitched as he asked, "And how do you expect me to take responsibility?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Be my boyfriend!" Jade declared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade's voice was firm, leaving no room for negotiation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She seemed to have regained her usual brash and headstrong personality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She spoke directly and without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You know I've got a lot of women in my life. Doesn't that bother you?" Marcus asked, his tone playful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't care, as long as you don't bring them along when you're with me!" Jade replied firmly, her gaze unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade's eyes were filled with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Earlier, she had exposed herself in a deeply embarrassing situation in front of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was an intimate moment for any woman, laid bare entirely before Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made it impossible for Jade to face any other man besides Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, after these encounters, Jade had become completely captivated by Marcus' extraordinary skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though she refused to admit it, the truth was that she admired Marcus more and more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She even longed for a deeper connection with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But being a proud and private woman, she would never reveal such thoughts to anyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, after what Marcus had seen earlier, what else could possibly embarrass her now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And so, Jade made her bold decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she spoke, she climbed over the passenger seat, straddling Marcus with her legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The heat of the day meant Marcus was only wearing shorts, and Jade's exposed lower body pressed directly against his thigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A surge of heat rushed through him, leaving him struggling to maintain control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Jade made an even bolder move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She swiftly pulled off her top, revealing a purple lace bra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fair, tantalizing curve of her cleavage was now directly in Marcus' line of sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tell me, do I look good?" Jade demanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though phrased as a question, her tone left no room for doubt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In other words, no matter what Marcus actually thought, he had no choice but to say she looked good&mdash;or face her wrath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You look great," Marcus said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This wasn't flattery. From her features alone, Jade was undoubtedly a stunning beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From her face to her figure, she was nothing short of breathtaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now, her glowing, porcelain-like skin added a touch of irresistible charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then kiss me!" Jade commanded again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade's tone left no room for refusal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without waiting for Marcus to agree, her hand had already wrapped around the back of Marcus' head from behind, directly burying Marcus' face into the tantalizing curve of her cleavage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade tilted her head and let out a high-pitched cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The curve was so deep that it instantly gave Marcus a sense of suffocation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sniffing the faint fragrance that passed through Jade's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus naturally wouldn't let go of the chance; one hand directly plucked down that purple lace bra, revealing the pink areola inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That broad bean sized bump, already firm and incomparable, Marcus subconsciously touched it with the tip of his tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A seductive moan escaped from Jade's mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This touching sensation was even more real than the previous treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It made her unable to resist lowering her head and kissing Marcus' lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As his lips met, Marcus also felt an unprecedented sense of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His tongue broke through his teeth and tangled with Jade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the gasps of men and women intertwining came from inside the Aston Martin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus kissed and caressed Jade's huge breasts at the same time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Constantly teasing the other party's most sensitive parts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade had already felt an incomparable emptiness in a certain area, and even though she had reached her peak twice in a row during the course of treatment, that emptiness had increased rather than decreased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, once again being so teased by Marcus in this manner, she naturally couldn't bear it anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While kissing Marcus, she automatically removed her trousers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only the purple lace panties were left on her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' big hand saw that mysterious zone, the interior had long been muddy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' fingers kept tweaking that sensitive area, causing Jade to keep letting out high-pitched cries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A surge of electricity spread around her body, causing her to reach the peak again, her lower body contracting non-stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But before she could react, she felt a huge object suddenly intrude!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An unprecedented tearing sensation spread throughout her body, causing Jade to let out a painful moan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah, it hurts... I'm in so much pain. What was that thing that came in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't care what Jade said, his hands gripped the other party's hip joints and began to move up and down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the movement of his body, that swelling feeling became more and more intense.</span></p></div>
