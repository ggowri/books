Your strength isn't enough to take him down. You'd better bring those three Grandmasters of yours, or you're not going to make it out alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser's eyes narrowed slightly as he listened to Gertie's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a mocking laugh, his voice dripping with disdain. "Looks like that guy really has you under his spell, doesn't he?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A kid barely in his twenties... No matter how strong he is, there's no way he can take me on. Not even close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We don't need the three Grandmasters for this. I'll bring the Four Guardians with me, and that will be more than enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie, as Yasser's former fianc&eacute;e, knew exactly who the Four Guardians were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were strong, but in her opinion, they were no match for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, she suspected that, even together, those four wouldn't be able to stand up to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew this because she had experienced Marcus' power firsthand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he fought, she had felt completely helpless with no ability to even resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't just a difference in strength. It was an insurmountable gap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie couldn't shake the feeling that Marcus might even be an expert at the Return Essence stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser ignored her and left the dungeon without a second glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he left, he felt a sick satisfaction watching Gertie in her tortured state. It didn't bother him in the slightest. On the contrary, he relished it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus, unaware of what had happened, continued with his day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a blissful night with Ada, she had to leave early the next morning due to some pressing matters, heading back to her sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Marcus was about to return to Bayside Villa, a crushing pressure suddenly descended, distorting the air around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like an invisible weight that crushed down on him, warping the space around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a brief moment, it felt like he had been transported to another world entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moment later, five figures descended from the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leading the group was none other than Yasser, flanked by the Four Guardians of the Tucker family. Their auras were heavy and oppressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of them were top-tier martial artists, each at or above Ancient Martial Stage Nine. Together, their strength was formidable and not something to be taken lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow, his gaze settling on Yasser. "What's the meaning of this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser's eyes narrowed as he took in Marcus' presence. A flash of murderous intent flickered in his eyes, and he spat, "I can't believe I ever thanked you. So it turns out you've been messing around with Gertie. If I had known, I would've killed you right then and there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' expression didn't change. He looked at him with a faint, almost amused smile. "You? Kill me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll give you one chance. Leave now with your people, and I'll let you go. Otherwise, things will get ugly for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser's gaze darkened, and a cruel smile spread across his face. "What's this? Trying to act tough when you're about to die? What a joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As soon as I found out about you and Gertie, you became a dead man walking. No matter what tricks you try, you won't escape your fate. Today, I'm taking you back to the Tucker family, locking you up with that slut, and then sending both of you straight to hell!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser's smile turned ice-cold, as if he could already see the scene in his mind, both Marcus and Gertie in his hands, suffering until their deaths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' brow furrowed slightly. "What have you done to Gertie?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser grinned maliciously, his voice dripping with venom. "That slut is already locked up in the dungeon. Once I bring you back to the Tucker family, I'll make sure you both suffer. What's the matter? Are you feeling sorry for her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, Marcus' anger flared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what, Gertie had been with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of Yasser locking her away in the dungeon was something he could never forgive.</span></p><div class="pagination">
