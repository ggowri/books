  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, everyone in the room froze, their expressions stupefied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haley thought, "What's going on? Isn't this guy from the countryside?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How did he suddenly summon so many people? Could he actually have some extraordinary background?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who exactly are you?" Haley blurted out instinctively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus crossed one leg over the other, lit a cigarette, and replied coolly, "Someone like you doesn't deserve to know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haley's face darkened, his jaw clenching in frustration. "Ha! Afraid to say, huh? I bet these people are just the actresses you hired. Gotta admit, their acting is pretty convincing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words seemed to resonate with the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd started to think that this country bumpkin might have spent a fortune hiring the actresses just to put on this charade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These actresses must've cost you a pretty penny, huh? Blew an entire year of your parents' farming income, didn't you? What an ungrateful son!" Robert sneered, his tone dripping with mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfazed, Marcus simply gestured toward Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana led the group to open the cases.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The gifts Mr. Fitzgerald has prepared are as follows," she announced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One pair of Victorian-era golden vases!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A set of ruby-encrusted wineware!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A chest of top-grade black pearls!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One billion dollars in cash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words thundered through the room, reverberating in everyone's ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone stood dumbfounded, their minds blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the guests was Michael Moore, an antique collector.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Haley presented his own antiques earlier, Michael was impressed by the display. But he wasn't too shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those items were rare but attainable with enough money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, however, Michael couldn't stay seated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rose from his chair, his body trembling as he approached Marcus's gifts, his eyes alight with fervent admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These...these are priceless treasures!" he exclaimed, his voice quivering with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is that possible? How could it be? He's just a country bumpkin, how could he possibly have so many priceless treasures?" Haley couldn't accept the reality, and her face darkened to the extreme. "No, these must be fake! These things are definitely replicas!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert immediately chimed in, "Mr. Brown is right! Those can't be genuine. There's no way he could afford such treasures!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said with a mocking smile, "This gentleman is a seasoned antique collector. Let him verify their authenticity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michael retrieved a magnifying glass from an ornate wooden box and began carefully examining the items.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After five minutes, Haley could no longer contain himself. "Well, Michael, aren't these just fakes?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as Michael's evaluation progressed, his expression grew increasingly fervent. His voice trembled as he declared, "They're real. All of them are real. And each piece represents the pinnacle of craftsmanship from its era. Any one of these items at auction would fetch an astronomical price."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The revelation hit everyone like a thunderclap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The news was simply too overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A poor man from the countryside had brought forth a trove of treasures worth unimaginable sums. It was beyond comprehension!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haley's face turned ashen. Struggling to accept the truth, he asked, "Michael, compared to mine, how do his items measure up in value?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michael didn't hesitate. "To be honest, Mr. Brown, any single item here is worth a hundred times the combined value of your entire collection."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haley stood frozen, his face betraying his utter disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't believe that any single item of Marcus' was worth hundreds of times more than all of his gifts combined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert looked flustered. His gaze at Marcus was filled with shock and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "How could this young man, claiming his parents were mere farmers, possess such priceless treasures and a billion dollars in cash?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This isn't the kind of wealth ordinary farmers could ever have."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus took a long drag of his cigarette before turning to Haley. "If you're not convinced, feel free to present gifts more lavish than mine. Oh, wait, you don't have that kind of capability, do you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haley's expression turned stormy. Gritting his teeth, he spat, "Fine, I admit defeat today!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But don't get too cocky. I'm the heir to TreatMed Pharmaceuticals! Your little trinkets are nothing compared to the wealth of my family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"TreatMed Pharmaceuticals, is it?" Marcus turned to Diana. "Inform the group, cancel all cooperation with TreatMed Pharmaceuticals immediately."</span></p><div class="pagination">
