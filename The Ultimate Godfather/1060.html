        <h1>Chapter 960 Impotent</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lecher, this proves Mr. Roger Gellar isn't as shameless as you, nor as lustful as you are. Besides, this is between the two of us. What does it have to do with you? Mind your own business," Alison snapped at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suppressed the disappointment stirring in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words had barely landed when Marcus burst into laughter, a raucous, breathless guffaw that left him gasping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lecher, what's so funny? What's there to laugh about?" Alison demanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His reaction irritated her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus shot back, "He's not as shameless as me? Are you sure?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've lived for over 100 years. Don't tell me you've never understood men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Men liking women is a trait etched into their very genes. Any normal man would harbor those kinds of thoughts about a woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he doesn't have those thoughts about you, there are only two possibilities."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He put away his smile and got serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alison's curiosity was piqued despite herself. "What two possibilities?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He replied, "First, he doesn't like you but prefers other women. Maybe he's surrounded by a harem, drowning in lust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Second, he doesn't like you, or any woman at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Figure out which one he is yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The second one. He's the second one. He doesn't like me, and there aren't any other women around him either," Alison blurted out, only to regret it instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no point telling Marcus anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Worse, she'd just spilled something deeply personal about Roger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus erupted into an even louder fit of laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you laughing at? I genuinely don't get it. Why do you keep laughing like that?" Alison glared at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't just a shameless lecher. He seemed downright unhinged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm laughing because my dear brother, whom I've never even met, can't get it up." Marcus finally revealed the source of his mirth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, it was simple logic: a normal man couldn't possibly lack desire for women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man without such urges had to be impotent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way. Stop spouting nonsense. I believe Mr. Roger Gellar isn't like that. He's just focused on achieving his grand ambitions and doesn't have time for romantic entanglements," Alison retorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet even as she spoke, doubt crept into her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus had pointed out, she'd encountered plenty of men in her century of life, and none had been like Roger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Powerful men often surrounded themselves with wives and concubines, and affairs were commonplace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Roger had never shown the slightest interest in any woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze remained clear, untainted by the flicker of lust she'd come to expect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' words had jolted her, forcing her to confront an unsettling realization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A pang of disappointment welled up within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since she'd joined Roger's side, Alison had considered herself his woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She dreamed of the day she might serve him in bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, it seemed he didn't even like women at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that she desperately needed that from him, but without it, she couldn't have a sense of belonging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her thoughts churned, leaving her distressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could dwell further, Marcus suddenly latched onto her nipple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A jolt of electric sensation shot through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She let out a high-pitched cry, her face flushing crimson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lecher, what are you doing? Let me go right now, or I swear I won't hold back." Alison thrashed desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, her strength was no match for Marcus. No matter how she struggled, it was futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tongue teased her nipple relentlessly, awakening every sensitive nerve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each touch sent a shockwave through her, her body twisting involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That long-dormant desire flared within her once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Memories of the last time Marcus had taken her flooded her mind, her heart pounding uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hated him for forcing himself on her and wanted to skin him alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as those sensations returned, a shameful craving stirred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't deny it. The feeling had been extraordinary. It had been the most wondrous and exhilarating she'd experienced in her entire life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The orgasm had been intoxicating and irresistible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet her pride fought back, and she suppressed her longing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was ashamed of even fantasizing about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like she had betrayed Roger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, with Marcus stimulating her again, that ecstasy crashed over her once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pleasure surged through her, flushing her cheeks and drawing sultry gasps from her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her lower body grew wet. A trickle seeped out, soaking her undergarments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lecher, let me go. You can't do this to me. I belong to Mr. Roger Gellar." Alison struggled on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her resistance weakened as the impulses within her intensified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her protests mingled with heavy, panting breaths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The seductive, soul-melting sounds betrayed just how much she was enjoying it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus ignored her pleas. With a swift motion, he yanked her underwear down, revealing a damp patch that exuded a faint, feminine scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fingers brushed her slick, muddy crevice, and he smirked, "You're the type who says no with your mouth but screams yes with your body. Look at you&mdash;drenched and ready. You want me inside you, yet you keep playing hard to get. I don't get why someone like you even exists."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words dripped with mockery, igniting a flare of shame and fury in Alison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cursed herself inwardly for her weakness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the moment his fingers grazed that sensitive nub within her crevice, her passion was ignited once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A louder cry tore from her throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A stronger current surged through her, her body convulsing as she climaxed instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her crevice clenched rhythmically, fluids gushing out to envelop his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were warm and silky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't hesitate. He plunged deeper, exploring her with abandon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still reeling from her climax, her body shuddered, her cries growing ever more lascivious as he continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah... Lecher. Let me go now, or I'll kill you," Alison moaned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her threats were laced with breathless gasps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her trembling frame glowed with a rosy flush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without further delay, Marcus activated the Heavenly Circle Diagram, unleashing the Illusion Rune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, their surroundings shifted. They found themselves in an ancient palace in Weston Land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the center lay a massive bed. Marcus scooped Alison up and tossed her onto it, pinning her beneath him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lips crashed against hers in a frenzied kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps overwhelmed by the intensity, Alison began to reciprocate, her gasps growing louder.</span></p></div>
