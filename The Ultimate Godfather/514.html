        <h1>Chapter 513 Cut Off One Finger</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver's gaze was filled with disdain as he stared at Landon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Landon gritted his teeth and retorted, "What if my father knows? I've said it already. Even if you are the </span><span>Battle God</span><span>, you have no right to interfere in the Whitman family's affairs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having torn off all pretense, Landon no longer held back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, his uncle was the head of the Deleon family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Oliver wanted to act against him, he would have to consider his uncle's influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, very well. Let's call your father here right now so you can repeat what you just said in front of him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before finishing his sentence, Oliver took out his phone and dialed Kent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Less than five minutes later, the door to the room swung open, and a visibly anxious Kent hurried inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Father? Why are you here? Weren't you busy in a meeting?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Kent coming, Landon rushed forward to greet him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Landon could finish speaking, Kent struck him hard across the face, causing him to stumble and nearly fall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Father, why did you hit me? What did I do wrong?" Landon looked stunned and confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kent's forehead was drenched in sweat as he berated his son. He said, "You ungrateful fool! How dare you disrespect the </span><span>Battle God</span><span>? Are you tired of living? Bow and apologize to him immediately! If you don't, even I won't be able to save you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as these words came out, Landon's face turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked Kent again, "Father, I was only stating facts. Am I wrong?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, you're the head of the Whitman family, and I'm your son. Why should we fear Oliver?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Landon could finish, Kent silenced him with a furious shout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fool. If you don't want the Whitman family to be destroyed, bow and apologize to the </span><span>Battle God</span><span> this instant, do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kent's eyes were bloodshot, and his voice cracked with desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Landon refused to comply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver turned to Kent and said, "Kent, if you can't even control your own son, how can you possibly manage a family as large as the Whitman family? You're clearly unfit to remain as its head."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kent's face darkened at Oliver's words. Panic-stricken, he pleaded, "</span><span>Battle God</span><span>, please listen to me! Landon doesn't understand the situation. I beg you not to punish him or remove me as the head of the Whitman family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't repeat myself. If anyone is to blame, it's you for offending someone you should never have crossed," Oliver said with an icy sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, his gaze shifted to Marcus, and his demeanor softened with reverence. "Let this be clear to everyone. Mr. Fitzgerald is someone my Deleon family holds in the highest regard. Landon dared to disrespect him. That alone is a crime worthy of death. If you cannot earn Mr. Fitzgerald's forgiveness, the consequences will be dire."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These words made Kent, Landon, and the Thurman family members all paralyzed with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had anticipated that Marcus' status could be so exalted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From Oliver's words, it was clear that the entire Deleon family treated Marcus with utmost reverence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deleon family was the most prestigious in Uswad, so what kind of extraordinary status must Marcus hold?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kent's expression completely collapsed as he bowed deeply before Marcus, pleading repeatedly, "Mr. Fitzgerald, it was my son's ignorance and lack of judgment that offended you. I beg for your forgiveness this time. I am deeply grateful to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the distinguished head of the Whitman family, Kent, began bowing repeatedly to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene completely stunned the Thurman family members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Father..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Landon was filled with despair, unable to believe his father would go to such lengths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, it felt as though the very foundation of his being had crumbled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus cast a brief glance at Kent and said calmly, "Your son repeatedly threatened to kill me. Do you think this matter can simply be brushed aside? I need an explanation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Marcus' words, Kent seemed to grasp his intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he drew a machete from the waist of one of his subordinates and approached Landon. Gripping his son tightly, he forced Landon onto the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Landon's face turned pale with terror as he struggled desperately, but his resistance was futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of everyone, Kent ruthlessly chopped off one of Landon's fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Landon let out a blood-curdling scream, nearly passing out from the excruciating pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shocking scene left everyone in the room frozen in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could have imagined that with just a single sentence from Marcus, Kent would willingly sever his son's finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This brutal act starkly demonstrated how insignificant Kent was compared to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Landon writhed on the ground, drenched in sweat, his face contorted in agony as he teetered on the edge of consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could never have foreseen that offending Marcus would lead to such a cruel punishment from his own father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, is this enough? I beg you to grant my son a chance to redeem himself," Kent pleaded, his voice filled with sincerity.</span></p></div>
