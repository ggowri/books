  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing Alison's attack, Marcus was calm. He casually launched a Fist Ray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite its seemingly light and effortless appearance, the Fist Ray contained a destructive force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, it collided with Alison's attack. The explosion echoed through the air, releasing an overwhelming wave of destructive force in all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alison, surrounded by her magic aura, looked radiant and ethereal, like a fairy. Her delicate face bore confidence as if she was sure this strike would be enough to defeat Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as the clash between their attacks intensified, Alison's confidence gradually faded away. She felt an irresistible force descend upon her, and within moments, her attack crumbled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' Fist Ray, undiminished in power, continued its trajectory toward Alison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This realization left Alison horrified. She hadn't expected that even after advancing her cultivation, Marcus could still easily break through her attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Has this pervert also advanced his strength?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As this thought raced through her mind, Alison quickly stepped back, using her experience from their previous encounter to avoid the Fist Ray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite dodging the attack, the sheer force behind it left her disheveled and breathless. Stumbling backward, she gasped for air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's impossible! How can your strength still be so formidable? Did you advance recently?" Alison asked. Disbelief etched on her face as she steadied herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had believed that her cultivation advancement would make dealing with Marcus a trivial matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she had overestimated herself, and this realization dealt a severe blow to her confidence, making it hard for her to accept the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Alison didn't know was that Marcus had only used half of his power in this attack. If he unleashed his full strength, even with her combat experience, Alison wouldn't stand a chance to evade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you regretting coming here now? It's not too late to turn back. Strip naked, get into position, and let me thrust you. Perhaps I'll be gentler with you. Or what awaits you will be far worse than you can imagine," Marcus sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words were blunt and infuriating, causing Alison's breasts to bounce with each breath. "Bastard, I swear I won't rest until I kill you! I'll tear you into pieces and flush them down the toilet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she gathered an even more powerful attack, launching it at Marcus. The force of this attack was immense, enveloping Marcus' body in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus remained suspended in mid-air, looking very calm. Just as the attack was about to reach him, he casually made a Hand Strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This Hand Strike seemed weak, but in the blink of an eye, it intercepted Alison's attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another deafening explosion rang out, unleashing waves of destructive force into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Alison spared no effort, drawing upon all her potential. Yet, Marcus shattered her attack effortlessly. The Hand Strike retained its full power and approached Alison in mere moments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alison's face turned deathly pale. She couldn't believe the sheer magnitude of Marcus' power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alison tried to dodge, but it was futile. In an instant, Marcus' Hand Strike transformed into a claw, gripping her left shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alison felt as if a monstrous force had seized her, pulling her body inexorably toward Marcus. She struggled with all her might to break free, but it was no use.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power Marcus wielded was beyond her ability to resist. The claw tightened, causing a sharp pain that made Alison scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Marcus pulled her into his arms. A powerful surge of male pheromones enveloped her body, making Alison tremble uncontrollably as she fought desperately against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alison growled, "Let me go! Let me go now, or I'll kill you!" She struggled with all her might. But no matter how hard she tried, she couldn't escape Marcus' grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hands tightened further, moving up to grasp one of her breasts and kneading it forcefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Its size has increased since we last met," Marcus said as he yanked at her clothing, exposing her round and voluptuous breasts. One breast was half-covered, revealing a pink nipple, creating a striking visual impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't do this to me! If Roger knows how you treated me, he'll kill you!" Alison threatened, struggling fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regret flooded her heart. She regretted overestimating herself and coming to Uswad to seek revenge on Marcus. If not for her arrogance, she wouldn't be in such a humiliating situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh, because you are his woman, I must have you. I want his woman to climax beneath me," Marcus sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no good feelings toward his unseen older brother, Roger, who had been plotting to eliminate him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Marcus, Roger was a mortal enemy, and possessing his woman was a form of revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are shameless! How can you say such disgusting things?" Alison roared, filled with shame and anger, wishing she could kill Marcus apart right then and there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm curious. Since you are Roger's woman, why were you still a virgin? Does he not like you?" Marcus asked with a mocking smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This question struck deep within Alison's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a hundred years, ever since she was assigned by the Godfather to be by Roger's side, Alison had considered herself his woman. Yet, Roger had never touched her, not even holding hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their conversations always revolved around his grand plans, never delving into personal matters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sometimes, Alison had been troubled by this, questioning her attractiveness. Was she not beautiful or charming enough for Roger to desire her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after a century, their relationship remained purely professional. Alison, as Roger's most trusted confidante, supported him and helped him achieve his ambitions. But their relationship never progressed beyond that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, when Alison heard Marcus' words, a pang of sadness unexpectedly welled up inside her.</span></p><div class="pagination">
