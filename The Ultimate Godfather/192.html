  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's heart skipped a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harvey's eyes immediately widened in shock, and he asked, "Mr. Logan Wilde, this guy is the country bumpkin from Solomia. Did you recognize the wrong person?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan glared at him, and his expression became as cold as before. "Of course not. Even my father needs to respect Mr. Fitzgerald!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His reply stunned Harvey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that Logan's father, Brenden, was a big shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brenden was a founding father and had fought in many major battles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to his advanced age, he was reassigned to head the Solomia Special Police Academy. He was superior in rank and position to the so-called celebrities!&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He should even be respectful to Marcus. What was his identity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was only in his early 20s and came from a small place like Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he be that powerful?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, Harvey's mind went blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides him, Lester, Troy, Peter, Melina, Judy, and the others were so shocked that they were speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As members of Kingston's upper classes, they knew Logan and Brenden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' identity had completely exceeded their understanding!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you Mr. Wilde's son?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brenden's robust figure crossed his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, he is my father!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan nodded. He was over 40 years old, but he acted like a younger generation in front of Marcus. "Mr. Fitzgerald, my father mentioned your deeds to me before. I admire you deeply. I have always wanted to visit you, but I am afraid that I will disturb you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is a great honor to meet you now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan respected Marcus deeply as if he were his junior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your father and I are friends, so you don't have to be so polite."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved his hands and didn't care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harvey said through gritted teeth, "Mr. Logan Wilde, despite your friendship with him, you should arrest him because he broke into my villa to cause trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan glanced at him coldly and stressed, "Mr. Fitzgerald is a righteous man. He is a hero who prevented a hijacking accident. How could he be as evil as you said? You must have provoked him. I can't do anything about it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He saluted Marcus respectfully again and said, "Mr. Fitzgerald, I'm sorry for being ignorant and disturbing you. Busy with official duties, I'll lead the team away first. I'll come to apologize to you another day!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan gave orders to the SWAT officers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, hundreds of officers armed with heavy weapons retreated with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harvey's face turned extremely dark. He was able to get Logan to move such a large force solely because of his father's connections.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his surprise, Logan no longer took care of this matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Harvey was alone and helpless again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's eyes fell on Marcus, who slowly stood up from his seat and walked towards Harvey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harvey's forehead was covered with a cold sweat, and he involuntarily stepped back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want to do, you country bumpkin?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sneered, "You should know what I want to do. Just use whatever tricks you have. I will play with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Harvey was really scared. "I warn you, don't try to harm me. I am part of the Burnett family in Kingston. If you dare to attack me, you are going against the Burnett family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Burnett family? You really think highly of yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked sarcastically, "You are just a member of a branch. How can you have a say in the Burnett family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harvey was completely anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, he was from a branch and didn't have a say in the Burnett family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only person he could rely on was his father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his father had not returned from abroad yet, so he no longer had any means to compete with Marcus!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Harvey could react, Marcus had already grabbed his shoulder with one hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harvey struggled desperately, but he felt that his body was bound so tightly by an irresistible force that he couldn't move at all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You insulted Natalia, so I will destroy your mouth today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus kept slapping Harvey in the face fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harvey screamed miserably.</span></p><div class="pagination">
