  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another male student encouraged Edward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm really sorry. I have something to do this afternoon, so there's no need for us to spar."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus politely declined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't afraid of Edward, and he just found it completely unnecessary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edward glanced at Marcus and said, "Our academy's ring training ground is nearby. I also want to spar with you, Mr. Fitzgerald. It won't take up too much of your time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always been fond of Maxine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she was his student, her attitude towards him was always lukewarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the past few years, Edward had expressed his love for Maxine more than once but had always been rejected by her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Very disappointed, Edward kept looking for the reason but got no answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just now, he saw Maxine and Marcus talking and laughing together, which brought his jealousy to its highest point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Murphy, Marcus said he had something to do this afternoon. Why did you insist on sparring with him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's face darkened. She glared at the male students behind Edward and said, "And you guys, you're just adding fuel to the fire. Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since she even turned against them for Marcus, those male students had strange expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a long face, Edward felt even more jealous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maxine, are you protecting him so much because you're afraid he'll lose to Mr. Murphy? I don't think your worries are necessary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just a sparring match. Mr. Murphy will be careful not to hurt him. Besides, won't it be honored to fight with the national boxing champion?" A tanned, handsome male student couldn't help but say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His name was Caleb Collins, the male student with the best fighting skills in the class, and he was quite popular throughout the academy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine was furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These guys were deliberately making things difficult for Marcus and trying to make a fool of him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Maxine was about to speak, Marcus waved his hand at Maxine, looked at Caleb and Edward, and said, "Let's make a deal in advance. We can have a sparring match, just one. You'll let me go after it's over. How about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edward and Caleb showed a triumphant expression and quickly agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine secretly panicked, believing that Marcus was going to suffer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he had done a good job on the plane, his strength should be on a par with hers, so he was definitely no match for Edward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Murphy, be careful and don't hurt Marcus!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edward's eyes turned icy, but he nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The news of their fight spread through the academy like a whirlwind.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus arrived at the fighting training ground with them. Unexpectedly, it was already crowded with people who came to watch the fight!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus and Edward stepped into the ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Marcus could prepare himself, Edward tried to throw a punch at him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was powerful, fierce, and terrifying. He was indeed the national boxing champion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Edward, how could you do this?" Maxine growled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was very angry about Edward's dishonesty and sudden attack and also concerned about Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus narrowed his eyes and dodged Edward's punch with a casual move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold face, Edward delivered another punch with a force several times stronger than the previous one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he still failed to hit Marcus. Edward became upset and launched frantic attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how fierce his moves were, he could not touch Marcus at all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't expect him to be so powerful!" someone exclaimed in shock. Not many people could handle so many attacks from Edward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! Yet, Mr. Murphy is definitely not fighting against him with his real strength. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been defeated within three moves from Mr. Murphy!" another person retorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone present agreed with him in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edward was a former national boxing champion and a top-notch expert in their entire SWAT academy.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite having killed two gangsters on the plane, Marcus could never be a match for him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's heart was in her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcus were injured by Edward, she would definitely feel extremely guilty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she caused it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus dodged Edward's attack again and whispered, "You are no match for me. Let's stop now. I will show you my weakness, and we can call it a draw!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should fight hard to tie with me. Don't talk nonsense!" Edward sneered, gazing at him with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Marcus' dodging speed impressed him, he still didn't think that Marcus was a match for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were very close to each other, and only they themselves could hear their conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes were sharp. He didn't expect Edward to be so stubborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the secret communication, Edward's attacks became more intense, each of which went straight for Marcus' vital points. Marcus sneered at his almost mad look.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It dawned on him that if he didn't defeat Edward, Edward would continue to harass him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After another heavy blow from Edward, Marcus easily threw him away without hesitation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though strong, Edward couldn't overcome the gravity of the earth. His feet barely touched the ground, and he almost fell!</span></p><div class="pagination">
