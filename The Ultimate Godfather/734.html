        <h1>Chapter 733 Let Her Go</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus leaned back against his seat, a cigarette in hand, watching the smoke curl into the air. The release earlier left him feeling utterly content, and this time, the effects of their Dual Cultivation were astonishing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cultivation had surged, reaching the Ancient Martial Stage Nine&mdash;an unexpected breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had always believed that Dual Cultivation worked best with virgins, delivering diminishing returns afterward. Yet this breakthrough shattered his assumptions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps the effectiveness didn't just depend on one's partner but also on how much he personally enjoyed it. The more pleasure he felt, the more powerful the results seemed to be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few moments later, Natalie finally stirred from her blissful daze. Her face was still flushed, and her body felt like jelly, utterly spent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, you're such a tease. Is this really how you greet someone after not seeing them for so long?" Natalie's eyes shimmered with playful accusation, though even her scolding carried a captivating allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't you miss me? Don't you want to be close to me? If you say no, it only proves you don't really care about me as much as you claim," Marcus shot back with a mischievous grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." Natalie's cheeks burned crimson. After a pause, she murmured, "Of course I missed you. But I'm a woman, Marcus. I can't just blurt out whatever's on my mind like you do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus tilted his head, a playful smirk tugging at his lips. "Alright then, answer me this&mdash;do you want me to hold you like that again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught off guard, Natalie bit her lip. She didn't want to deny it and risk upsetting him. Hesitant but honest, she nodded. "I do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus burst into laughter. "See? So don't blame me anymore. You want it just as much as I do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing she'd fallen into his </span><span>trap,</span><span> Natalie pouted and threw light punches at his chest. "You're such a scoundrel. Tricking me into admitting things like that&mdash;how shameless can you be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unbothered by her protests, Marcus started the car and drove her home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though it had only been a day, Natalie felt like she'd lived through ten. Exhaustion weighed on her, especially after Marcus had thoroughly worn her out. All she wanted now was to collapse into bed and recharge for tomorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dropping her off, Marcus headed back toward Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bitch! Let go! Do you even realize how lucky you are that Mr. Walsh took an interest in you? If you don't cooperate, we won't hold back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus drove past a dimly lit alley near the warehouse, muffled shouts and cries reached his ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A young woman's voice, trembling but defiant, rang out. "You pigs! Get your hands off me. If you don't, I'll call the police."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reply came with a sneer. "Call the police? Go ahead. Let's see if they'll dare lay a finger on Mr. Walsh. He's the founder of Royal Entertainment&mdash;practically untouchable. Be smart, sweetheart. Stop struggling, and who knows? Maybe Mr. Walsh will reward you handsomely for playing nice. Your career might just take off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the commotion, Marcus frowned. The name Walsh immediately clicked&mdash;Zachary Walsh, the founder of Royal Entertainment. But what caught his attention even more was the familiar voice of the girl. He recognized it was Chloe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Memories of her flashed through his mind. Chloe was not only one of the Twelve Rising Stars but also Lila's closest friend in the entertainment industry. And now, she was in trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus pulled over abruptly, stepping out of the car and heading straight into the alley. Under the dim light, he saw a group of burly men surrounding a petite, trembling young woman. Tear streaks glistened on her delicate face. It was Chloe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!" Marcus' voice thundered, halting the men's movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thugs turned to </span><span>him,</span><span> their faces etched with disdain. Having recently arrived in </span><span>Solomia</span><span> from the Greater Bay Area, they didn't recognize Marcus. One of them, a hulking brute, sneered, "Listen, kid. This doesn't concern you. Walk away before you bite off more than you can chew."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe's tearful eyes widened when she recognized Marcus. For the first time that night, a flicker of hope appeared on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe had attended an event hosted by Royal Entertainment earlier that evening. But </span><span>on her way home, she'd been ambushed by Zachary's henchmen. They wanted her to accompany Zachary, claiming he'd taken a special interest in her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe knew the entertainment industry was full of dark waters and unspoken rules. She'd heard the stories and seen others fall victim to them. Even so, compared to many actresses, she had managed to stay clean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So far, no one had forced her into those sordid deals, and she had kept her dignity intact. But deep down, Chloe wasn't sure how much longer she could hold out in this tainted world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the day came when she couldn't resist anymore, what choice would she have but to accept her fate? Still, the thought of being sent to please an old man was revolting. That was why she had put up such fierce resistance earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only now that Chloe saw Zachary's true face. The man who appeared kind and charitable in public was nothing like the reality. Behind his polished image lurked a disgusting, lecherous old man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, Chloe had dismissed the rumors about Zachary's predatory behavior. She thought they were nothing more than baseless gossip. But now that she was his target, she realized just how revolting he really was&mdash;worse than she could have ever imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And as if that wasn't enough, the men who'd cornered her had made it clear: even if she agreed to meet Zachary, she would first have to be "inspected". If she wasn't a virgin, Zachary would send her back without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe felt nothing but disgust. She thought, "An eighty-year-old man obsesses with virgins? How could someone be so twisted?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Marcus caught her eye, giving her a calm but reassuring look. He turned to the group of men, his voice steady and cold. "I don't care who you work for. Let her go and get out of here. If you don't, you'll regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words made the men pause for a split second. Then they burst into mocking laughter. To them, Marcus' warning was nothing more than empty bravado.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These weren't ordinary thugs. As Zachary's bodyguards, they were trained professionals. Many of them had backgrounds as special forces or mercenaries. Together, they were a force few could stand against.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To them, Marcus was just another fool with no idea what kind of power he was up against.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the men stepped forward with a sneer, cracking his knuckles. "You've got guts, I'll give you that. But you clearly don't know who you're dealing with. Looks like I'll have to teach you a lesson about how the world works."</span></p></div>
