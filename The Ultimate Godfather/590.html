        <h1>Chapter 589 Demon Fighter</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? How could this be? Your power has reached the ninth level of the state in </span><span>Solariae</span><span>. How did you do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman said in disbelief, her voice tinged with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clearly remembered that merely a few months prior, Diana was only a Level Five Demon Fighter, while she was a Level Seven Demon Fighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, Diana had been no match for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet now, Diana's power had soared far beyond her own, a reality that she found difficult to swallow for the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not qualified to know that. Alison, let me tell you, get out of </span><span>Uswad</span><span> right now, or don't blame me for killing you without any concern for our past friendship!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alison Krauss looked rather angry and said through gritted teeth, "Diana, don't get too cocky. I will trample you underfoot again someday. Besides, only Mr. Roger Gellar is </span><span>qualified to succeed Godfather. Just wait and see. Godfather is dying, and when he passes away, Mr. Roger Gellar will kill all of you, and then it will be your time to suffer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alison disappeared into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The horrible coercion in the air vanished as Alison left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's body slowly descended in front of Marcus, and she asked him with concern, "Mr. Fitzgerald, are you alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus frowned and clutched his chest in pain. "Uh... It hurts so much. I feel a sharp pain here..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus in such pain, an even more worried look immediately appeared on Diana's pretty face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, where exactly does it hurt? Don't frighten me. Tell me, and I'll help you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus could tell that Diana was truly distraught, afraid that he had been hurt just now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Marcus' current power and strength, there was a huge gap between him and Alison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any random attack from Alison on Marcus could potentially cause fatal harm to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here, Diana! Hurry up and check if I'm dying..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus pointed at his lower abdomen and </span><span>said</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't think too much and directly reached out to touch Marcus' lower abdomen. "Is it here, Mr. Fitzgerald?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, a bit further down. You just need to move a bit further down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana didn't know what was on Marcus' mind. She continued to move down and suddenly touched something quite firm and moving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana, of course, knew what it was, and her pretty face immediately flushed. At the same time, she instantly realized what happened and told Marcus in anger, "Mr. Fitzgerald, are you fooling me? You are so mean!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana wanted to withdraw her hand when she spoke, but Marcus hugged her and kissed her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana let out a soft moan, feeling her body tremble as if electrified. For a moment, it seemed that she couldn't control her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, don't... If someone sees us here..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Marcus raise his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, Diana's pretty face was so flushed that she was panting heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Mr. Fitzgerald was so mean. How could he lie to me in such a way?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Men are truly good for nothing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, are you sure you're alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Diana still seemed to be anxious about Marcus. After all, Alison was too formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course. How can a woman hurt me? No way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, stop bragging, okay? Do you know how powerful Alison is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana curled her lips and said with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How powerful is she? Tell me in detail. I'm just curious," Marcus asked with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's a Level Seven Demon Fighter. You probably have no idea about this level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me put it this way. Whether it's the existing tiers of warriors, wizards, metahumans, and numerous other professions in your eyes, they can all be lumped into the Foundation Establishment Stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Demon Fighter is a state that is above the Foundation Establishment Stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When someone becomes a Level Nine Wizard, he can break through the shackles of the Foundation Establishment Stage and become a Level One Demon Fighter through the cultivation and unique methods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alison is an expert who reached Level Seven Demon Fighter. With your current power at Ancient Martial Stage Seven, she is exactly one great level ahead of you. This gap in power is not something describable with words."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Diana's words, Marcus couldn't help but feel extremely astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Timeless Warrior's Grimoire and Magic Codex both repeatedly emphasized the Foundation Establishment Stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus could verify this from what Diana had said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The state they were in was only Foundation Establishment Stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were many higher states above the Foundation Establishment Stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard Alison say you were a Level Nine Demon Fighter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus calmed down and asked Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm curious why you two look like you're only in your early twenties, but you're cultivating so fast."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked, which was the most puzzling thing in his mind.</span></p></div>
