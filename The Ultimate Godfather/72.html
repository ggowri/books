  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia was so scared that she burst into tears, fearing that Marcus would be hit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus used all his strength to activate the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire. Under the effect of his Numinous Energy, his senses became extremely sharp, and his reaction speed instantly increased several times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how dense the bullets were, they still couldn't hurt him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While dodging, Marcus also counterattacked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Leo's henchmen didn't have Marcus' abnormal reaction speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as Marcus pulled the trigger, someone would fall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Marcus rushed towards Leo like an arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo was a bit shocked and tried to avoid Marcus' attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was just an ordinary person, and his speed couldn't be compared with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus took a step forward, spanning ten feet and landing directly in front of Leo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo was terrified and turned to run away, but Marcus grabbed his shoulder and then his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go of Mr. Brown. I can give you a chance to live." A stern voice sounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, a middle-aged man in his fifties walked out of the manor, who had blond hair and blue eyes, and a faint aura of magic lingered around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a magical aura was light, and Marcus wouldn't have been able to feel it if he hadn't been practicing Magic Codex recently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus recognized his identity at a glance and thought, "He is a Wizard in Weston Land, and he has reached the Stage Two."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Johnson, help me kill this redneck," roared Leo, looking extremely tough on the surface, but his body had actually begun to tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Young man, there is a saying in Uswad that a wise man submits to circumstances. You should understand it. If you dare to hurt Mr. Brown, not only will you die, but the people around you will also be implicated," said Johnson Wood to Marcus. In his palm, there was a faint light of lightning ready to release.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus ignored Johnson and directly broke Leo's neck. Then, he threw Leo's body on the ground like garbage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo's eyes widened. He had never imagined that Marcus would dare to kill him in front of Johnson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Brown." Seeing Leo being killed, Johnson was completely furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chanted a spell, and lightning suddenly burst out in his palm, which transformed into a bolt of lightning and struck Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lightning reached up to tens of thousands of volts. Once being hit, the person would be reduced to ashes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was already prepared and quickly dodged to the side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the lightning fell along his body, causing a stinging pain in his skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnson narrowed his blue eyes. He didn't expect Marcus' reaction speed to be so fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you are actually a warrior of Uswad. No wonder you are so courageous," said Johnson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly realized what was going on, and then a strange smile appeared on his face. "Well, I haven't killed a Uswad warrior yet. I'll kill you today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Johnson attacked Marcus with lightning in his left hand and fire in his right hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus hadn't expected that Johnson actually mastered two methods of magic attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, each attack method was of a high level and could kill the enemy with one blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Marcus' first time fighting against a Wizard, so he didn't dare to be careless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing the attack of lightning and fire, he quickly dodged and took a step forward, rushing towards Johnson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying fist aura broke through everything and landed in front of Johnson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnson chanted a spell silently, and a black vortex suddenly appeared in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' fist aura fell but was utterly submerged by the black vortex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnson showed a smug smile and said, "Warriors of Uswad are nothing more than this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before he could finish his words, he saw that Marcus' fist aura had actually transformed at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mighty flame gushed out from the fist aura, instantly turning into a sea of fire that directly enveloped Johnson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnson looked grim and quickly dodged. But it was too late. The flames spread to the surface of his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then hurriedly chanted a spell that could control fire and finally escaped with difficulty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in a very short period, he was burned beyond recognition and looked highly miserable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uswad also has a saying for you. Pride comes before a fall," said Marcus to Johnson with a sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnson was immediately enraged and released all his magic power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lightning and fire intertwined as if a ferocious beast from Weston Land appeared in the air and swallowed up Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus was not afraid at all and punched out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He merged the Fire Elemental Power in his body into the fist aura and collided with the ferocious beast from Weston Land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a deafening explosion, the beast from Weston Land shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Marcus' fist aura remained as powerful as ever and landed in front of Johnson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are so young, but your cultivation has reached the Ancient Martial Stage Two. How is this possible?" Johnson was a little bit unbelievable. Only at this moment did he truly learn of Marcus' cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Marcus' fist aura, Johnson had no time to dodge and was knocked back continuously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved his hands, and the power of magic transformed into a huge feather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnson then walked up and tried to escape by riding the magic feather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is it too late to leave now?" asked Marcus.</span></p><div class="pagination">
