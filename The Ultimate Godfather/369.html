As a layman, he certainly can't fight alone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When he is on the battlefield, he is likely to be a burden to us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who cares? He insists on taking part in this activity. If anything happens, he deserves it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing these, Maxine frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't believe that these officers were so contemptuous of others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine knew that once the action started, these people would know Marcus' strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps only the youngest general in Kingston was worth competing with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wilde, the latest news from the action group said that Abel and Josiah, and other important figures of Black Hawk Legion will attack Solomia's information database with their mercenary team tonight and steal important information. Please ask the dean to make important instructions!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, an officer from the information department came over, saluted Brenden, and reported.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brenden looked cold and said, "The Black Hawk Legion has been operating frequently in Uswad recently, which seems to be premeditated. Tonight we are going to wait for him in the information database and kill him off guard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you have confidence?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of SWAT officers were in high spirits, and their voices were loud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't expect that just after they arrived in Solomia, Abel and Josiah appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a good opportunity for them to make contributions!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>SWAT officers were secretly calculating in their hearts how to win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wanted to win the first prize for their special police brigade!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You three listen to my command tonight. You must arrest Abel and Josiah before everyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As the capital of Uswad, Kingston must also set an example. The first achievement tonight must belong to us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a tall, heavy-eyed young police officer walked into the strategic deployment office, looking dominating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This young man was upright and majestic, and he looked like a general at a glance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Oliver!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The youngest general in Uswad!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader of Kingston Special Police Brigade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was known as the god of war!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a past peacekeeping military conflict, he killed 88 enemy soldiers alone, pursued the enemy leader to the depths of the desert with a gun, and killed the enemy commander. He became famous after that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver was well known all over Uswad, and no matter where he went, he was the focus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, all eyes were focused on Oliver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone cherished this opportunity to fight side by side with this legendary figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, it also greatly inspired the fighting spirit of the rest of the members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they could arrest Abel and Josiah before Oliver, they would be famous throughout Uswad!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver's words were powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one dared to disobey!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition to Oliver, the Special Police Brigade of Solariae, Concord, and Veritas all had their leaders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was a swat elite who enjoyed a good reputation in Uswad and had rich combat experience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tonight, they were bound to take all the bandits who sneaked into Uswad by the Black Hawk Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, it was nine o'clock at night, and the night had already arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had put on camouflage nocturnal equipment and sneaked into the Solomia's information database.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To keep this operation confidential, no one was informed before the operation, and everything was going on in secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus and Maxine formed a team with several students from Solomia Special Police Academy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far away was the Kingston special police brigade led by Oliver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others were arranged in other directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they could communicate with each other by walkie-talkie</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was ready, only Marcus leaned against a corner, reposed, and even took off all his equipment, looking a little lazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Abel and Josiah may appear at any time. Take your equipment quickly, or it will be too late."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine walked over and warned Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus still didn't open his eyes and said lazily, "Don't worry, these guys are battle-hardened veterans. Even if the two of them appear, they can't get information easily. Even if you stay here for one night, you may not be able to catch them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is better to take this opportunity to have a good rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sentence immediately aroused the dissatisfaction of the special police brigade of Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An officer sneered and said, "A careless action on the battlefield may make you die. Your fighting attitude is not worthy to participate in this action at all. I suggest to exclude him, so as not to affect others!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
