I miss you every night. When I think of the scene with you at that time, I feel so shy..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus couldn't stand this stimulation, and he quickly took off Catherine's clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her breasts bounced out, making him excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus started to suck them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah..." Catherine couldn't help but tremble, and her lower body became even wetter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' hand wandered over Catherine's delicate body, making her feel an unprecedented sense of stimulation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His hand soon reached her lower body, and a warm liquid wrapped Marcus' fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As if stimulated by the fingers, Catherine's lower body contracted and became warm and slippery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' hand began to move, his fingers going in and out of that area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catherine kept moaning, and her body swayed even more violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Marcus touched the bulge, Catherine trembled violently and reached the orgasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A large amount of fluid was secreted from the gap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, stop teasing me. I can't stand it anymore..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catherine was lost in endless lust, feeling her lower body was empty as if in urgent need of being filled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus took off Catherine's pants, revealing her pink lace underwear, which was transparent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even without taking off the underwear, he could vaguely see the scenery inside, especially the gaps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He pulled her underwear off and inserted it into the hole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catherine let out a cry, and her lower body contracted violently in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The strong feeling of expansion gave her great satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She felt as if she was flying into the clouds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Marcus exerted force with his waist, a huge wave of happiness came again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catherine moaned in pleasure and automatically spread her legs, allowing Marcus to invade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus thrust hard, feeling Catherine's lower body constantly contracting, and he also fell into endless lust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unlike last time, Catherine was more relaxed this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter what posture Marcus used, she would try her best to cater to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The dim room was filled with gasps, screams, and the sounds of flesh colliding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Several sounds intertwined together, revealing the lust of the two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Marcus' cultivation improved, his ability was significantly enhanced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sex lasted for an hour and a half.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catherine reached three orgasms in total, and her body collapsed on the bed, with the sheets soaked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before this, she would never have thought that one day she would make love with Marcus on her bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After finishing the sex, Catherine fell into a deep sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus took the opportunity to enter a state of cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next morning, before Catherine woke up, the door was opened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sensitive to the sound of the door opening, she suddenly woke up from her sleep. "My parents are back. Hurry up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While speaking, Catherine was hurriedly putting on her clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Catherine, are you home?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Laura's voice came from outside the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mom, I'm at home. Please wait a moment..." Catherine answered while putting on her clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this time, Laura and Philip had walked into the house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catherine hurriedly put on her clothes and walked out of the bedroom with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Laura and Philip looked at each other and asked Catherine, "Catherine, were you at home with Marcus yesterday?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catherine was very embarrassed, but she nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You haven't had breakfast yet, right? I will make breakfast for you now." Laura took off her coat, preparing to go to the kitchen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Philip walked up to Marcus and patted him on the shoulder, showing a meaningful smile. "Young man, you are good. No wonder you made those desperate men of the Heaven Syndicate surrender. When I was dating Laura back then, I didn't dare to go to her house. You are so bold."</span></p></div>
