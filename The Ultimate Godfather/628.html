  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before Albert could come back to his senses, Marcus' voice rang out again. "Ms. Gomez, since you are here, please authenticate two more pieces of jewelry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elena narrowed her eyes and then replied, "Mr. Fitzgerald, you are a big customer of our store. Of course, there is no problem!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was puzzled, wondering what Marcus was trying to authenticate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said, "I heard that this man bought an Angel's Kiss and a handmade diamond ring in your store an hour ago. Please check their authenticity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, he raised his hand and pointed at Albert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Marcus finished his words, everyone realized that he actually wanted to verify the genuineness of Albert's jewelry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was indeed interesting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in everyone's impression, Albert was from a wealthy family and was known to be a person of great integrity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He and Luna were a loving couple, and the birthday presents they exchanged were, without a doubt, genuine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' request was indeed unnecessary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when everyone was lost in thought, Elena suddenly exclaimed, "An hour ago? Mr. Fitzgerald, I've been on duty in the store today, but I didn't catch wind of any sale of the Angel's Kiss an hour ago!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many of them frowned and gazed at Albert in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mentioned before that he had bought the Angel's Kiss at the jewelry store an hour ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that moment, Elena's statement contradicted his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was going on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert's face immediately darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He promptly explained, "The reason is that individuals at your level aren't eligible to interact with the store's senior executives. I bought the necklace and ring directly from one of them, so you are naturally in the dark!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His explanation seemed very reasonable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone nodded with relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said, "In that case, have your jewelry verified."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had previously noticed a hint of something amiss in Albert's expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given Albert's current reaction, he became even more convinced of his earlier assumption.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Embarrassed, Albert was at a loss for words to refute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Albert could make a sound, Luna, who had been silent for a long time, said, "Albert, since he brought it up, allow them to authenticate the jewelry. After all, the pieces you purchased are genuine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert's face darkened even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To avoid Luna detecting his unusual demeanor, he could only force a smile and stress, "Luna, the Angel's Kiss symbolizes my affection for you. Now that you have put it on your neck, it can't be touched by anyone else. Thus, there is no necessity to allow them to authenticate it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sneered, "That's an excuse. I think you're afraid that your jewelry will be proven to be fake!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nonsense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert flew into a rage, never expecting that Marcus would keep pressing him. "I love Luna so much. How could I buy fakes? Don't slander me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus continued, "Since your jewelry is indeed genuine, then why are you reluctant to present it for verification?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert seemed eager to say something more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Luna took off the Angel's Kiss from her neck and gave it to Elena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her trust in Albert, she always felt something was wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, Jade handed over the diamond ring that Albert had presented her as a token of their friendship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert completely lost his composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the jewelry was proven to be fake, he would be doomed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would make a fool of himself in front of his classmates and might probably lose a girlfriend like Luna!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, out of control, he rushed forward to snatch the two pieces of jewelry back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the moment he extended his hand, Marcus seized his wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus snorted, "Why the haste? Wait until the verification is over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go of me. You have no right to limit my freedom. If you don't release me, I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a livid face, Albert struggled to break free but to no avail. Marcus' grip on his wrist was like a vice, immobilizing him completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was taken aback that things had evolved to this stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Gomez, please verify the jewelry!" Marcus ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elena finally snapped out of her shock and promptly began the verification process with her colleagues.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than two minutes, they returned the Angel's Kiss to Luna and the diamond ring to Jade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am sorry, ladies. Our verification process has determined that these two items are high-quality imitations, not authentic pieces."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as these words were uttered, everyone stared at Albert in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had never anticipated that he would actually buy two fakes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the beginning, didn't he insist that Marcus' Tears of the Angel was fake?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why was the situation reversed now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' Tears of the Angel was verified as genuine, while Albert's Angel's Kiss turned out to be a counterfeit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How dramatic!</span></p><div class="pagination">
