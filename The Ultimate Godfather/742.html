        <h1>Chapter 741 One-Punch Dominance!</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Marcus remained unfazed by the middle-aged man's oppressive aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood calmly, letting the pressure wash over him. Like an immovable mountain, he didn't budge an inch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sight raised eyebrows among the onlookers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all knew this middle-aged man came from an ancient and prestigious martial arts family from </span><span>Uswad</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held considerable influence within that martial arts family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though both were at Ancient Martial Stage Six, his mastery was far more stable than Marcus'.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His aura alone made other Ancient Martial Stage Six masters uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Marcus showed no reaction whatsoever. It was truly astounding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man's gaze froze, studying Marcus intently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned slightly and said, "Well, well, seems you've got some skill, kid. I underestimated you. Let's see how long you can keep this up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man began chanting as he spoke, releasing an even more terrifying coercive force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like millions of pounds of pressure, bearing down on Marcus with overwhelming might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force was so intense that it kicked up stones and sand, making the area an apocalyptic scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under this horrifying pressure, many onlookers stepped back instinctively, afraid of </span><span>being caught in its effects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus stood unaffected, as if separated from this space by an invisible barrier. No matter how terrifying the other's coercion was, it couldn't touch him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that all you've got?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus fixed his mocking gaze on the middle-aged man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling his authority challenged, the middle-aged man flew into a rage. "Fine, very well. You deliberately provoked me, so don't blame me for showing no mercy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he stepped forward, making the ground quake beneath their feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His aura surged rapidly, quickly reaching a new power level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrifying Numinous Energy gathered in his palm as he struck, sending a Hand Strike hurtling toward Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Hand Strike materialized in the void, instantly enveloping the space before Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It descended upon Marcus with devastating force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spectators watched in </span><span>horror,</span><span> shock written across their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone spoke up, "The </span><span>Heavenstrike</span><span>! I can't believe he's using his signature move against this young man!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Though he's only mastered the third level of the </span><span>Heavenstrike</span><span>, it should be more than enough to deal with this youth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Indeed. This young man came in arrogantly, entering without announcing himself and talking back. If he's killed by the </span><span>Heavenstrike</span><span> now, he brought it upon himself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd murmured among themselves, many nodding in agreement with these words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kid, you should feel honored to die under my </span><span>Heavenstrike</span><span>!" the middle-aged man sneered as he unleashed his strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, this strike would end Marcus' life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Marcus remained unfazed in the face of the incoming attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the strike was about to reach him, he casually threw out a Fist Ray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The punch appeared weak and flimsy, with no Numinous Energy surrounding it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like a physical attack without any energy enhancement and lacked significant power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here was Marcus, appearing so arrogant as to face the </span><span>Heavenstrike</span><span> with such an essential move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd shot him mockingly, eager to see him crushed under the opponent's strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>BOOM!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the two forces collided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man let out a sarcastic smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't believe Marcus dared to counter him with such a basic Fist Ray, and his face showed absolute confidence in his victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as the collision intensified, the smirk on the middle-aged man's face slowly froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt an irresistible force hidden within that seemingly ordinary Fist Ray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This power grew more terrifying by the second, and his proud strike began to crumble in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crack after crack echoed through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Marcus' Fist Ray, his strike shattered piece by piece, dissolving into sparks scattered in the wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Marcus' Fist Ray continued its unstoppable advance, enveloping the middle-aged man's body with overwhelming destructive force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Disbelief filled his eyes as he stuttered in shock, "How is this possible? How could a mere physical punch pack such devastating power? Did you use some magical weapon?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish speaking, Marcus' Fist Ray struck him head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying boom echoed through the air as the middle-aged man was blasted away like a cannonball.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slammed hard into the nearby cliff wall, causing a thunderous crash as spiderweb cracks spread from the point of impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man's eyes widened in terror and unwillingness to accept his fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His chest was caved in, his internal organs shattered, and blood continuously spilled from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lips twitched as if trying to speak, but he couldn't manage it. Life slowly drained from his body until there was nothing left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in death, his eyes remained wide open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Never in his wildest dreams had he imagined he would meet his end today atop Divine Mount.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All because of his arrogance, his fatal mistake of looking down on others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, Marcus had been nothing but a worthless junior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though their cultivation levels were equal, he believed Marcus couldn't possibly compare to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd assumed he could lord over Marcus, who would have no choice but to submit to his questioning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he'd kicked a steel plate and paid for it with his life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Witnessing this scene, everyone drew in sharp breaths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their gazes toward Marcus changed, growing heavy with newfound gravity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before this, they thought the middle-aged man had unleashed his ultimate technique, and Marcus would surely pay the price for his actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to their shock, the middle-aged man's proudest skill proved useless against Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With just a casual Fist Ray powered by pure physical strength, Marcus instantly ended his opponent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone trembled at such overwhelming power. They never dreamed this seemingly ordinary young man could possess such terrifying combat ability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deathly stillness fell over the space, no one daring to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially those who had mocked Marcus earlier, who kept their mouths firmly shut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such was the way of this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strong devoured the weak, who endured endless bullying. Only with formidable power could one earn others' respect.</span></p></div>
