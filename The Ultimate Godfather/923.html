  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That evening, the McHale family threw a grand welcome banquet for Marcus. He </span><span>hadn't wanted to make a big deal out of his visit, but Rhett, Cecilia, and the others had been nothing if not enthusiastic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Naturally, Marcus couldn't avoid drinking at the event. With so many elders of the McHale family taking turns offering toasts, he ended up a little tipsy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Out of everyone, Cecilia had been his most eager drinking partner. He didn't know much about her and had no idea if she was always this good with alcohol, but tonight, she had left him completely stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had downed three full bottles of 750ml red wine on her own. And red wine wasn't some light drink&mdash;it had a decent alcohol content. Three bottles of it? That was a lot, especially for a woman. Unsurprisingly, by the time she finished, her face was flushed, and it was clear the alcohol had finally caught up to her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the banquet, Marcus returned to his room, planning to spend the night training before heading back to </span><span>Uswad</span><span> the next day. But he hadn't been at it long when a knock on the door interrupted him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who is it?" he asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, a soft, sweet voice answered from the other side. "Mr. Fitzgerald, it's me. I wanted to talk for a bit. Can I come in?" Despite being born and raised in </span><span>Acoton</span><span>, Cecilia's voice was ridiculously pleasant to the ear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>People always said women from Weston Land were tough and fierce, but she was the exception. With her angelic face and such a lovely voice, she was nothing like the stereotype.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus responded, "It's not locked. Come in." As soon as he finished speaking, the door slowly creaked open, revealing Cecilia's stunning figure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecilia had clearly just taken a shower, now dressed in light, silky sleepwear. The moisture from the bath had left her skin looking even softer and more delicate than usual.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus couldn't help but raise an eyebrow at the sight. "Come sit."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every time he'd seen Cecilia before, she had always been dressed formally, never anything as relaxed as this. But seeing her in such a casual setting only made her sweetness stand out even more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecilia didn't hold back and casually sat down on the edge of Marcus' bed. A faint, soothing fragrance lingered around her, subtly filling the air.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's pretty late, and I'm still here bothering you. You don't mind, do you, Mr. Fitzgerald?" Cecilia asked, her gaze fixed on him. A touch of warmth flickered in her deep blue eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus chuckled, "Of course not." At this distance&mdash;barely half an inch between them&mdash;he had a clear view of the enticing sight just beyond the neckline of her nightgown.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maybe it was because she had just taken a bath, but Cecilia clearly wasn't wearing anything underneath. The gentle rise of her curves peeked through the fabric, her skin glowing under the dim light, smooth and flawless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus could even faintly make out the delicate peaks beneath the thin material, barely visible yet enough to send a rush of heat surging through his lower abdomen. Instinctively, he averted his gaze, afraid he might lose control and do something </span><span>reckless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As if sensing his lingering stare, Cecilia's cheeks took on a faint blush as she asked, "What are you looking at, Mr. Fitzgerald?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Nothing," Marcus replied, deliberately clearing his throat to shake off the awkwardness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're a real hero, a man among men, Mr. Fitzgerald. In my eyes, you've always been strong and fearless. So why not just admit it?" Cecilia's eyes locked onto his, her sapphire irises gleaming with sincerity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' forehead creased slightly as he stammered, "Uh..." For a moment, he was completely at a loss for how to respond.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then tell me, Mr. Fitzgerald&mdash;do you think I'm beautiful?" Cecilia asked again, her tone serious. "And don't give me a polite answer. I want the truth."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus took a deep breath before replying, "You're beautiful. Like an angel. Honestly, you might just be the most stunning </span><span>Acoton</span><span> woman I've ever met."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was no falsehood in his words&mdash;Cecilia truly was the most breathtaking </span><span>Acoton</span><span> woman he had ever seen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for Diana and Alison, they belonged to a different category&mdash;Demon Fighters, not ordinary women. In Marcus' mind, they weren't even in the same classification. But Cecilia? She wasn't just as beautiful as them&mdash;she had a charm that was entirely her own.</span></p><div class="pagination">
