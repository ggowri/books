        <h1>Chapter 664 A Spiritual Anchor</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene had been imagined countless times before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would be a lie to say that Marcus wasn't feeling comfortable at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie had always been an emotional anchor for him during his puberty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, as his long-held wish was finally fulfilled, it only intensified the primal desires deep within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This session lasted nearly two hours before it finally came to an end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie had lost count of how many times she had reached the climax.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body was wet. A large amount of liquid soaked into the seats of the Aston Martin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It emitted the unique fragrance of a virgin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, in a wild, storm-like surge, Marcus completely erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps because he was too comfortable, he even forgot to pull it out and instead poured it all out to Natalie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie's body kept shaking, and she was completely taken over by lust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Filled by Marcus, Natalie felt an unprecedented sense of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body was on the verge of passing out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lay half-reclined in the seat, gasping for air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took a long time before Natalie woke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was still flushed, but the look she gave Marcus was full of desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I told you, I won't take responsibility. Are you going to regret it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus lit a cigarette, taking a drag as he asked Natalie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie's gaze was resolute as she shook her head gently. "No, I won't regret it. I told you before I'll do what I said. Giving myself to you was my choice, and it has nothing to do with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was taken aback by her response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given Natalie's usual demeanor, he had expected her to cling to him afterward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this answer made him regard her in a new light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I promise I won't cling to you, but could you take me home? It's late, and I'm afraid of the dark..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A pleading look appeared on Natalie's face as she turned to Marcus and asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus thought for a moment before responding, "Tell me the address."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie's face lit up with a radiant smile, so bright and beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then sent her home location to Marcus via WhatsApp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dawnview Gardens Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was Natalie's address.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus felt a strange familiarity with the location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking it over, he realized that Natalie hadn't moved in all these years. She had lived in this same community since high school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost ten years had passed, and she was still living here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, you didn't expect that, did you? I remember you came to my house when we were in school. You should know the way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seemingly noticing the surprise on Marcus' face, Natalie smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded indifferently but didn't use GPS, instead relying on the route stored in his memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He drove straight to Dawnview Gardens Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The community, built in the 90s, was fairly decent when Marcus was in high school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, after so many years, it had clearly aged into a run-down area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground, still wet from the recent rain, was filled with pits and puddles, making walking quite difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie stumbled and twisted her ankle, her face contorted in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't move. Let me take a look."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Marcus couldn't just ignore it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately scooped Natalie up and walked toward a nearby step, gently setting her down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire gesture was brimming with masculine confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie had never felt such a strong sense of security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, she felt a flutter in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a feeling of attraction, different from the admiration she had once felt, now distinctly romantic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never imagined she would be moved by the very boy she had once despised and looked down on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, in this specific moment, in this particular atmosphere, she had developed feelings for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie felt incredibly happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, she remembered what Marcus had said in the car, and a feeling of disappointment washed over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "He... wouldn't take responsibility for me... Everything was just my own wish."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, had no idea what Natalie was thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After placing her on the step, he began examining her twisted ankle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a severe sprain, and her ankle quickly turned red and swollen. Even the slightest touch caused her intense pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Endure it a bit. I'll help you treat it," Marcus said softly to Natalie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes narrowed, and she was about to ask Marcus about his medical skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could, Marcus activated his Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of Timeless Numinous Energy began to flow through his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, it surrounded Natalie's injured ankle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strong, comforting energy flowed into the affected area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie immediately felt an unprecedented sense of relief, as if a wave of warmth was flowing through the injured area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie couldn't help but let out a soft, pleasurable moan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having treated other girls before, Marcus knew this reaction was normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Natalie felt a deep sense of embarrassment.</span></p></div>
