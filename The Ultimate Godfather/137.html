        <h1>Chapter 136 Maxine's Instructor</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The image of Maxine, a policewoman as brave as any man, immediately came to Marcus' mind.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't I tell you before that I didn't want the bonus? Why did you apply for it for me?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is just routine work. Your heroic deed must be rewarded. I want you to cooperate," Maxine explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her serious tone made Marcus feel uncomfortable all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, since she insisted, he couldn't refuse. He immediately proposed to meet her at one p.m. at the gate of Solomia Special Police Academy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At 12:30 p.m., because the Alpha had been scrapped, Marcus was left to drive a second-hand Volkswagen Bora, used by the villa's servants to buy groceries, to the Solomia Special Police Academy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon his arrival, he saw Maxine, dressed in a police uniform and looking very capable, waiting inside the courtyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We meet again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus greeted Maxine with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was full of a sense of justice, but sometimes, she seemed very old-fashioned, which was a little unacceptable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine sized Marcus up and then glanced at his second-hand Volkswagen Bora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Come in. You will need to go to the office to sign for the company's special award. I'll take you there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus walked into the Solomia Special Police Academy. It was his first time in a police academy, and he felt an instant sense of solemnity.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the playground, many students were practicing, each with standard movements, full of vigor and a murderous aura. The special police were always in danger because they dealt with the most vicious criminals all year round.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to their physiological disadvantages, women were generally not competent for such high-intensity work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine seemed to be an exception.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of her outstanding appearance and excellent academic performance, she had always been the school belle of the academy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many men admired Maxine. She never even paid any attention to them, but she had a great time talking to Marcus!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They really wanted to know who he was that was worthy of her enthusiasm!&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, under Maxine's guidance, Marcus completed the signature and received a special reward of 100 thousand dollars and a medal for bravery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you so much. May I treat you to dinner tonight?" Marcus asked politely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Maxine was attentive to her and helped him get the bonus of 100 thousand dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he should invite her to dinner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine shook her head and said, "You deserved it. You don't need to invite me to dinner. Moreover, I should treat you instead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked in surprise, "Why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine explained, "You saved my life. Theoretically speaking, you are my savior, so it is only natural for me to treat you to a meal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she admitted that Marcus had saved her life, her tone was still as cold as an iceberg that was difficult to melt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maxine, who is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a tall and straight policeman wearing an instructor's uniform walked over from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He appeared to be around thirty years old, with a square face, thick eyebrows, and big eyes, and he seemed very righteous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Maxine's instructor, Edward Murphy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Murphy, let me introduce this gentleman to you. He is the brave hero I told you about a few days ago. His name is Marcus Fitzgerald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Last time on the plane, I would not have been able to defeat the gangsters without his help," Maxine smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edward looked Marcus up and down with scrutiny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several male students following behind Edward said, "He's a brave hero, so he should be a good fighter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone else analyzed and whispered, "I heard that those criminals were from the Black Hawk Legion and were extremely strong. He was able to kill two of them alone, so he must be quite capable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, my name is Edward Murphy. I'm Maxine's instructor, and I used to be a SWAT member."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edward was the first to extend his hand to Marcus, acting like a gentleman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus politely shook hands with Edward and introduced himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he did not reveal his real identity, and the address he reported was the rural house where his adoptive parents had lived before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ever since I was admitted to the academy, Mr. Murphy has been my instructor and has taught me many things. He has a high level of professionalism and has won the national boxing championship. He is also a very strong fighter," Maxine said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus cast an approving glance at Edward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was surprised that an ordinary instructor at the special police academy had such a glorious past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When someone asked them to compete with each other, Edward felt an immediate thrill, but he soon suppressed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The male students behind him were also excited by the suggestion. One of them smiled, "One of you is a national boxing champion, and the other is a hero who killed two gangsters alone. You should have a fight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes. Mr. Murphy, you could indeed consider sparring with the great hero."</span></p></div>
