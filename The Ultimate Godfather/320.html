Did we get the wrong room?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of the men in black said in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before that man could finish his sentence, a figure appeared like a ghost, silently descending in front of him. "You didn't get the wrong room."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A big hand grabbed his throat and squeezed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a crack, his throat was crushed, and he died instantly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other men in black reacted and tried to shoot Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't give them a chance, quickly unleashing deadly attacks, each one hitting its mark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The men in black were instantly killed, dead beyond doubt!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This scene scared the remaining man in black senseless, causing him to drop his submachine gun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He curled up in the corner, trembling!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tell me, who sent you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' eyes rested on the men in black and his aura liked that of Death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man in black felt a fear that reached his soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No, don't kill me. Mike sent us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man in black said with a trembling voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mike Cole!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' eyes narrowed slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Marcus walked out of the room, the man in black thought he had escaped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus turned and unleashed a burst of Numinous Energy, shattering the man's head, and then left the hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mike's cancer was completely cured, so he didn't want to stay in the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He left the hospital overnight and went back to his original hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the hotel, George was half-lying on the sofa, smoking a cigar and enjoying himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The cancer was completely cured, and he felt like a survivor. He was more relaxed than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How are those people doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon asked anxiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon couldn't be at peace for a moment without hearing the news of Marcus' death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grandpa, don't worry. I hired people from the Black Hawk Legion. The Black Hawk Legion is the first mercenary organization in the world. If their people take action, even if Marcus has superhuman powers, he will only die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mike said with a gulp of his cigar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mike still had considerable trust in the strength of the Black Hawk Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had hired them many times before, and they had never failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not only were they extremely efficient, but they were also very fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time should be no different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's good. Once Marcus is dead, our 100 billion dollars can come back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After listening to his words, Jordon was relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, as soon as Jordon's words fell, the door of the hotel was kicked open!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon and Mike were immediately startled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They looked in the direction of the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They saw a tall and imposing figure in their sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was Marcus!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They couldn't help but widen their eyes, full of disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus, you're still alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon said in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How can I die when you ungrateful people are alive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus sneered and appeared directly in front of Jordon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon instinctively retreated, but it didn't help at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' hand directly gripped his throat and lifted his body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon's face turned pale, and he was immediately surrounded by a sense of suffocation. He couldn't help asking for mercy, "Let me go. Please let me go. I know I was wrong. If you are willing to spare me, I can give you a lot of money!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, before Jordon could finish his words, Marcus punched him in the head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only heard a bang. Jordon's head burst on the spot, bloody pieces flying, and suddenly, he became a headless corpse!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This scene immediately scared Mike out of his wits. He looked pale and shouted, "Grandpa! You killed my grandpa. Aren't you afraid that the Cole family will retaliate against you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus sneered, "If the Cole family dares to retaliate against me, I don't mind getting it off the face of the earth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, he walked step by step towards Mike.</span></p></div>
