I hired people from the Black Hawk Legion. The Black Hawk Legion is the first mercenary organization in the world. If their people take action, even if Marcus has superhuman powers, he will only die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mike said with a gulp of his cigar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mike still had considerable trust in the strength of the Black Hawk Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had hired them many times before, and they had never failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not only were they extremely efficient, but they were also very fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time should be no different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's good. Once Marcus is dead, our 100 billion dollars can come back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After listening to his words, Jordon was relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, as soon as Jordon's words fell, the door of the hotel was kicked open!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon and Mike were immediately startled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They looked in the direction of the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They saw a tall and imposing figure in their sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was Marcus!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They couldn't help but widen their eyes, full of disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus, you're still alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon said in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How can I die when you ungrateful people are alive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus sneered and appeared directly in front of Jordon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon instinctively retreated, but it didn't help at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' hand directly gripped his throat and lifted his body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon's face turned pale, and he was immediately surrounded by a sense of suffocation. He couldn't help asking for mercy, "Let me go. Please let me go. I know I was wrong. If you are willing to spare me, I can give you a lot of money!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, before Jordon could finish his words, Marcus punched him in the head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only heard a bang. Jordon's head burst on the spot, bloody pieces flying, and suddenly, he became a headless corpse!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This scene immediately scared Mike out of his wits. He looked pale and shouted, "Grandpa! You killed my grandpa. Aren't you afraid that the Cole family will retaliate against you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus sneered, "If the Cole family dares to retaliate against me, I don't mind getting it off the face of the earth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, he walked step by step towards Mike.</span></p><div class="pagination">
