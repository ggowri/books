        <h1>Chapter 272 The Devouring Power</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus waved at Cooke and looked quite easygoing about his fantastic success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, the stone cutters divided those energy crystals into small pieces, and Marcus put them all in the Spatial Ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>According to his estimation, these energy crystals could almost purchase sixty miniature submachine guns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although the number was still not much, he still raised expectations for them after witnessing their power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An ordinary man armed with a miniature submachine gun would gain the power as an expert that reached Ancient Martial Stage Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With sixty of them, he got the equivalent of sixty experts at Ancient Martial Stage Two, which almost reached the scale of an Ancient Martial Art Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus was satisfied with that and would be more contended if he could get more energy crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, may I ask you about something?" Vanessa suddenly said to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What is it?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I wonder if you're interested in being my raw crystal appraiser," Vanessa said with expectations in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm afraid my answer is no, Ms. Tillman. I won't stay here for very long." Marcus shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Vanessa hadn't invited him to the attic, he would have left the Grand Fortune and gone around other districts in Southern Market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry, I won't take too much time of you, Mr. Fitzgerald. Just seven days. Does it work for you?" Vanessa said with some eagerness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Please give me some time to consider it." Marcus didn't make a decision right there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Biting her lip, she struggled to make the decision. "Well, I hire you as my raw crystal appraiser just for seven days to sort all the raw crystals we have here into three criteria in terms of their quality. You can have twenty percent of the profits in that week."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I want forty percent. If you can't guarantee that, please find another person for this job, Ms. Tillman." Before Vanessa continued, Marcus expressed his salary expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew that Vanessa hired him for so much money to sort out the high-quality raw crystals in order to control the price of them better so that she wouldn't lose too much money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Besides, she could directly sell some excellent raw crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Marcus' request stunned Cooke and Vanessa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Grand Fortune, under Vanessa's control, was the most prominent stone gambling market in Southern Market, with more than one trillion turnover per day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, it was really a bit unacceptable for Marcus to ask for forty percent of the profits for salary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vanessa still agreed, though.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, they made a pleasant deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus also stayed at the Grand Fortune for the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To entertain him, Vanessa brought many ladies with Southvaian beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't adapt to it and wondered if it was the tradition here to entertain the guests with women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Like last time, he directly refused the service of those beautiful women and was absorbed in the state of cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Several hours ago in the morning, he was able to slap Jennifer by exerting the advantage of the Shadow Step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was also the first time he had used this skill in actual combat, and he was indeed much faster than a warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In addition to improving the Shadow Step, Marcus also practiced Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, at the end of the practice, he had reached level three of Timeless Warrior's Grimoire!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the breakthrough, Marcus felt his physique was greatly enhanced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Plus, he would be rewarded after breaking through each level of the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus was also looking forward to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next moment, he only felt that there was a light in his mind, and he quickly merged into his memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Devouring Power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Devouring Power was the bonus of the breakthrough of the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He once saw something like Devouring Power in some TV dramas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This kind of cultivation manual was way too creepy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Using the power being devoured to boost his power was fucking awesome!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "It's really incredible to master Devouring Power! I can absorb others' power to improve mine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Marcus even began to expect the battle with more experts in the future.</span></p></div>
