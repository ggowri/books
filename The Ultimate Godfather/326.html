  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He got out of the car alongside Tony, walking toward the port.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they moved, Tony dialed a number on his phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a brief conversation, he led Marcus to a specific dock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Several men approached them. Marcus could see pistols tucked into their belts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tony spoke to the leader, a man missing one finger on his hand, "Jack, Mr. Fitzgerald wants to buy Acoton's latest model of submachine guns. How many can you get here today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man with nine fingers sized Marcus up and asked, "Where are you from? Care to introduce yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said and offered Marcus a business card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus took it without answering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tony quickly smoothed things over. "Mr. Fitzgerald is from Solomia. He's also a warrior. Please give us a favor, Jack. Maybe offer a discount?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jack said with a smile, "There are plenty of buyers here. Being a warrior doesn't mean much. I've seen all kinds of people. Look over there. The man is a warrior, too. Whoever offers the highest price gets the goods!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus followed Jack's gaze and saw a man with long flowing hair standing on a nearby abandoned ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Judging by that man's energy, he was indeed a warrior, and his strength had reached Ancient Martial Stage Two. In the secular world, he was already a master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Apparently overhearing the conversation, the man leaped down from the ship and walked toward them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sized Marcus up and said to Jack, "I don't like bidding against others. I prefer to solve things with strength. If he can defeat me, the entire shipment of guns is his."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, the long-haired man's energy flared, and his gaze burned with fighting spirit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without warning, he unleashed a powerful palm strike, its energy so strong that Tony and the others were forced to stumble backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus, however, didn't dodge or flinch. He simply watched the long-haired man approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud sound, the force of the strike descended on Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But it stopped just one millimeter from Marcus' body, blocked by a faint protective barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The long-haired man's eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You? You dare call yourself my opponent?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus sneered and pointed a finger, and a burst of Numinous Energy silently shot out from his fingertip, piercing through the man's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The long-haired man clutched his neck, his eyes filled with unwillingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His body collapsed to the ground. Before his death, he spoke out his final words, "You dare kill me? The Dragon Hall will not let you go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, his body fell still.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tsk..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The chilling scene made Tony and Jack gasp audibly, their spines tingling with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had never expected Marcus' strength to be so terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In their eyes, the long-haired man was already an elite among elites.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he couldn't even withstand a single move from Marcus. His throat had been pierced, and he died instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They felt a cold sweat running down his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tony, in particular, silently thanked himself for having been wise enough to submit earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he had offended Marcus, he would undoubtedly have met the same fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jack's attitude shifted immediately. No longer acting arrogant, he turned to Marcus with a respectful tone. "Mr. Fitzgerald, I'll personally see to it that the next shipment of guns belongs to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus simply nodded in acknowledgment without a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At 2 AM, a ship carrying Acoton's latest model submachine guns docked at the port.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under Jack's guidance, Marcus boarded the vessel and inspected the cargo. It was indeed the latest high-end shipment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These submachine guns were the same as the ones used by Diana, except she only had a dozen of them, whereas this ship carried thousands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was enough to arm a small battalion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Smuggled goods' price was naturally higher than the factory rate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, Marcus purchased the entire shipment for one hundred billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus couldn't take thousands of guns with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jack promised to arrange for the weapons to be delivered to Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Satisfied, Marcus left the port with Tony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the arms problem resolved, Marcus returned to his hotel. It was already 4 AM. He collapsed onto the bed and drifted off into a deep sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next thing he knew, it was 9 AM, and Marcus was woken up by a loud knocking on the door.</span></p><div class="pagination">
