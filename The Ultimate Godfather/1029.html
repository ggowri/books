        <h1>Chapter 939 The Ceremony Began-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the words left his mouth, the black-clad men behind him cracked their knuckles, their eyes filled with malice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them lunged first, throwing a brutal punch straight at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These weren't just hired thugs&mdash;they were Miles' personal enforcers. Ex-military, trained fighters, men who knew how to break bones and make people disappear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That punch? It packed serious weight. An ordinary person wouldn't have stood a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus wasn't an ordinary person. Just as the man's fist came flying at him, Marcus swung his own punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sickening thud echoed in the air as their fists collided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bloodcurdling scream tore through the parking lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The enforcer's hand shattered on impact&mdash;bones splintering under the sheer force of Marcus' counterstrike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stumbled back, his face twisted in pain, staring in absolute horror at his now swollen, discolored hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could even process what had happened, Marcus' next punch slammed into his face, knocking him out cold. He crumpled to the ground, completely unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest of the men saw this and immediately escalated. They reached into the black SUV, pulling out weapons&mdash;knives, iron rods&mdash;before charging at Marcus in a blind rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Son of a bitch," one of them snarled. "I've been doing this job for years, and this is the first time some punk has dared to fight back like this. Boys, break his hands, break his legs&mdash;hell, shove him in a sack and dump him in the ocean!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was laced with cold, murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe, standing just behind Marcus, was terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hands flew up to her mouth, her face pale with fear. She had no idea if Marcus could handle this many men at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus? He didn't even flinch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He moved like lightning&mdash;every punch, every strike landing with pinpoint precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of fists meeting flesh filled the air. Screams followed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just seconds, every single one of them was on the ground&mdash;writhing in pain, groaning, knocked out, or too broken to fight back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus dusted off his suit, his face utterly unbothered, and then turned to Chloe, who was still standing there, stunned speechless. "Let's go," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe blinked, still trying to process what had just happened. "Go... go where?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at her. "The Luminara Awards. Or did you not want to claim the Best Female Singer award that rightfully belongs to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart skipped a beat. "Wait," she asked, her voice filled with curiosity, "you're going to the Luminara Awards too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded. "Of course."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could ask anything else, he was already heading toward the parking garage elevator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe hurried after him, though worry gnawed at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hesitated and then warned, "Marcus... you just beat up Miles Donovan's men. He's not going to just let this go. Maybe you should skip the ceremony, just for tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus only let out a calm, almost amused chuckle. "Don't worry about Miles," he said. "He can't touch me. In fact, if he's stupid enough to come after me, his days as Vice President are numbered."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe stopped in her tracks, staring at him in shock.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Where did this kind of confidence come from?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As far as she knew, Marcus wasn't insignificant, but he wasn't exactly a major player either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was, after all, the new owner of Stellar Entertainment&mdash;a third-rate company in Uswad's entertainment industry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to Royal Entertainment, Stellar was nothing. And Miles?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was one of Royal Entertainment's most powerful figures. Ever since Zachary's death, Miles had effectively taken control of the entire company.</span></p></div>
