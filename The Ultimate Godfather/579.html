  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, what are the odds, Gina, Uncle Rodney?" Catherine Wilson greeted them with a polite smile. "I'm here to buy a house."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The newcomers were her uncle Rodney Wilson and her cousin Gina Wilson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike Catherine's father, Philip, whose gambling and drinking were legendary, Rodney was the picture of discipline and success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in the '90s, Rodney had left his factory job to try his luck in business, and it paid off handsomely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, he ran a thriving health supplements company with annual revenues in the millions and profits that matched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rodney was the shining example of what their family could produce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His relationship with Philip was strained at best.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rodney had long distanced himself from his brother's chaotic lifestyle, and aside from obligatory holiday gatherings, the families rarely interacted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gina, on the other hand, thought Catherine was still working as a real estate agent, just like after college.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> when Gina spotted Catherine here, she naturally assumed she was working there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Buy a house?" Gina asked, her tone dripping with skepticism. "Catherine, you just graduated. How on earth can you afford a place here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Catherine could reply, Rodney chimed in, his expression stern. "Catherine, I set you up with that job at Cedars Villas to give you a solid start.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not selling houses anymore, are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine nodded, her tone even. "That's right, Uncle Rodney. After Cedars Villas sold out, I moved on to a new job."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rodney sighed dramatically, shaking his head like a disappointed parent. "Typical. You're just like your father&mdash;never sticking to one thing. Being a sales agent might not be glamorous, but it's stable, and it pays the bills. Do you even understand how hard it is to find that kind of money elsewhere?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your family's situation isn't exactly rosy, Catherine. You don't have the luxury of flitting from job to job.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And let me guess, this new gig of yours probably pays peanuts compared to selling houses. Am I right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine raised an eyebrow, her patience thinning. "Actually, Uncle Rodney, my current position pays about ten million a year. It's a little more than I made as a sales agent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Growing up with a father like Philip, who treated drinking and gambling like full-time jobs, Catherine'd spent most of her life carrying a quiet shame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Around relatives&mdash;especially Rodney&mdash;she could never stand tall. Every encounter with him turned into a lecture, with Rodney donning his "concerned elder" hat to hammer her with unsolicited advice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, he probably thought he was helping, but to Catherine, his constant nagging felt more like he was rubbing salt into her wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Rodney really cared, where was he when her mother, Laura, was clinging to life in a hospital bed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His family didn't even visit, let alone offer to chip in for medical bills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then there was the job at Cedars Villas. Catherine had found the position on her own, excited to start something new.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But once Rodney caught wind of it, he swooped in like a hero in his own story, calling the sales office manager to "help her out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That "help" turned out to be useless. The manager was too busy playing favorites with another agent and ended up making Catherine's life harder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine hadn't forgotten any of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't need Rodney's charity, but she wished he'd stop pretending to care while making things worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rodney blinked, momentarily stunned, exchanging a glance with Gina, but Gina was quick to recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gina's laugh was sharp and dismissive, her disbelief evident. "Ten million? Seriously, Catherine? Your imagination goes wild, doesn't it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you even know what a ten-million-dollar salary looks like? That's CEO-level money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even executives at top companies don't make that much, and you're telling me you're earning it straight out of college? Come on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gina gave a pointed toss of her hair and smirked. "My dad just got me a job at Sync Group's </span><span>Solomia</span><span> branch as a sales manager. I've been in sales for years, and my salary is just over one million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're telling me you're making ten times that? Sorry, but I'm not buying it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine hadn't started her work at the branch office yet, so what Gina didn't realize was that Catherine was not only working at Sync Group but was her direct boss as the general manager.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rodney, meanwhile, looked like he'd reached the end of his rope. "You're sounding more and more like your father, always full of grand claims with nothing to back them up. Our family's reputation is bad enough without you making it worse."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When it came to his brother Philip, Rodney didn't just dislike him&mdash;he practically couldn't stand the sight of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine's jaw tightened, but she kept her composure. "Uncle Rodney, Gina, my boyfriend helped me get this job. And for your information, my dad doesn't gamble anymore, and he's cut back on drinking."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, Philip was a train wreck of a gambler and could outdrink a sailor&mdash;Catherine wasn't blind to his flaws.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But hearing someone else trash-talk her dad still hit a nerve, no matter how true it was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rodney snorted, crossing his arms. "Your dad quitting gambling? Sure. And I'm the King. Let me know when that happens."</span></p><div class="pagination">
