  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Atlas turned to Marcus and sneered, "Who do you think you are? I'm not looking down on you, but with someone like you, how could you possibly afford to run a company?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why don't you tell us the name of your company? Let us all hear it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Atlas' words, Edwin immediately chimed in, "Right, Atlas is right! What company do you run? Why don't you tell us? We'll help you check it out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Payne and Cora also wore smug expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had been acting calm so far, but now it was becoming more and more absurd. His words seemed to make no sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he really owned a company, why was he still so low-key?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And in their minds, </span><span>a company boss</span><span> would surely have a dedicated driver, wouldn't they?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus then asked, "You've heard of Golden Group, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as these words left his mouth, even Natalie looked at him in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During their last class reunion, she had learned that Marcus was the behind-the-scenes owner of Sync Group in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She also knew that even the Serpent's Coil of </span><span>Solomia</span><span> treated Marcus with utmost respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he was mentioning Golden Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Golden Group was the largest diversified company in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>, and its name was indeed well-known across the entire region.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Mia, who wasn't particularly familiar with large corporations, had heard of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that Marcus owned not only Sync Group but also </span><span>Solomia's</span><span> Golden Group?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie couldn't quite believe it. After all, it was rare for one person to control two large publicly listed companies, even in all of </span><span>Uswad</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was just a country boy who graduated from high school less than ten years ago. Could he really have two major companies now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that Natalie didn't trust Marcus, but the news was so shocking that it was hard to process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha, so you're saying Golden Group is yours?" Atlas laughed mockingly, his tone dripping with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sort of," Marcus replied calmly, nodding slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Marcus spoke, Atlas, Edwin, Payne, and Cora all burst into laughter, their expressions more cynical than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edwin spoke first, "Kid, you really can talk big!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you said you were a driver for Golden Group, no one would question you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But claiming to be the owner of Golden Group? Who could possibly believe that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of strength do you have? What's your background, pretending to be the boss of Golden Group? You've got no self-awareness!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Payne's face darkened as he looked at Natalie and said, "Natalie, this is the kind of boyfriend you're into? He dares to publicly pretend to be the boss of Golden Group. He's completely out of touch, treating us like fools! Someone like him is not worth your time. You better break up with him right now. Do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie's face darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the manager of a high-end jewelry boutique, she had conducted thorough research on potential clients in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clearly remembered that the chairwoman of Golden Group was a young woman named Michelle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet now, Marcus was claiming that Golden Group was his company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Natalie start to doubt Marcus' words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Atlas, being the sales manager of Bayside Petroleum Company, had also interacted with people from Golden Group before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He naturally knew that Marcus was lying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To prove it to everyone, Atlas immediately took out his phone, opened one app, and searched for Golden Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the company details popped up in front of him, including the legal representative, shareholder distribution, and key personnel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The legal representative was none other than a woman named Michelle, who held one hundred percent of the shares, meaning she was the absolute owner of Golden Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furthermore, Marcus' name didn't appear anywhere in the records.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at this. This is all the information on Golden Group. Where is this guy's name?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With how easy it is to look things up now, how could he still dare to lie in front of us? He really thinks we're all fools!" Atlas </span><span>sneered,</span><span> his face filled with mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing Atlas' words, even Mia, who had previously felt some positive regard for Marcus, now saw him in a completely different light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was an honest person and didn't like people who bragged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus had mentioned driving a company car to pick her up earlier, Mia had already criticized him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Mia's view, Marcus' actions seemed driven by vanity, trying to show off for no reason at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edwin's eyes gleamed with malice as he smirked. "How about this? Since he claims Golden Group is his, and he has such a big company, if he wants to marry my sister, his wedding gift has to be more than 20 million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Marcus and said, "Did you hear that? If you want to prove yourself or marry my sister, you better come up with a wedding gift worth more than 20 million dollars. Only then will we believe you!"</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
