        <h1>Chapter 804 Grace Was Kind-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many of those present grimaced and covered their noses in disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia's composure completely shattered. Unable to bear it any longer, she collapsed in front of Grace, crying and pleading, "Grace, I was wrong. I truly know I was wrong. I shouldn't have looked down on you all. We are classmates, so please help me beg Mr. Fitzgerald to forgive me this one time. I promise I won't dare again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace's heart softened. She hesitated and said to Marcus, "Mr. Fitzgerald, why not let her off this time? After all, she is my old classmate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Grace was a kind-hearted, soft-hearted girl, so he said, "The decision is yours. I really have no time to waste on this sort of person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And indeed, Marcus meant it. In his eyes, Kenia was no different from a lump of stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no desire to waste any more time on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Marcus' words, a faint, pleased smile appeared on Grace's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Kenia had behaved terribly before, Grace simply couldn't bring herself to be harsh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "I forgive you this time. I hope there will never be a next time. Now, go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Relieved, Kenia exhaled deeply. She thanked Grace before scurrying out of the restaurant in disarray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As her figure receded, many of those present sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They believed that Kenia's downfall was entirely of her own making.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She and Grace were classmates, yet Kenia had always been jealous of Grace. When she heard that Grace's father had fallen from power, she sought to kick her when she was down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she never imagined that she would ultimately bring ruin upon herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I truly apologize. I'm so sorry for disrupting our meal because of me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Kenia left, Grace cast an apologetic look toward Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gently ruffled Grace's hair and laughed, "It wasn't your fault at all. Why apologize?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the tumultuous events, everyone had learned of Marcus' true identity. Even the owner of the restaurant was well aware of the incident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they realized that such an illustrious figure was dining there, the restaurant staff immediately reserved the very best table in the house for Marcus and his companion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since this table was now occupied by Marcus, they believed that in the future, many patrons would come specifically to sit there and savor their meal as a way to bask in Marcus' noble aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The restaurant, too, would undoubtedly become even more popular because of Marcus' visit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the owner, it was a stroke of sheer luck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So he ordered the kitchen staff to prepare every specialty dish on the menu for Marcus and Grace, and to serve it all free of charge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet when it came time to pay, Marcus politely declined the owner's generous offer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the owner had worked hard for his business, and money was just a number to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Lydia had handled the matters concerning Nash and Kenia, she left with her team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, after finishing their meal, Marcus and Grace returned to the Ritz-Carlton Hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night was once again filled with passion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus engaged in three consecutive, intense sessions with Grace, driving her to the peak of desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only when she had completely fainted from exhaustion that he finally stopped and entered a state of cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He discovered that after their dual cultivation, his progress in refining his skills seemed to accelerate compared to when he trained with other women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After three sessions together, Marcus' cultivation had approached the critical threshold of the Hidden State. It was now just one step away from breaking into the Return Essence stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, before Grace had awoken, Marcus received a WhatsApp message from Natalia.</span></p></div>
