  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus turned to Kiera, clearly uninterested in watching the domestic drama any longer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera gave a small nod. "I'm good. Let's go."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without another word, they started walking toward Marcus' sleek Aston Martin.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kiera, leaving already?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Kiera turned to walk away, one of her friends from earlier hurried up, calling out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her eyes were glued to Marcus, unable to hide her curiosity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had no idea Kiera was friends with someone like him&mdash;someone so powerful, so attractive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Why couldn't they meet someone like him?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The girls couldn't help but feel a mix of envy and admiration.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald is taking me home. I'll head out now. Let's catch up another time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera smiled at her friends.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her friends, a bit shy, hesitated, but Kiera didn't blame them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, even if they had stepped in to help her in front of Maximilian, it wouldn't have made a difference.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It could have gotten them in trouble, too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera's worst fear was dragging anyone else into the mess she was in.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright then, we'll meet up another time. But next time, bring your boyfriend along! We'd love to meet him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of the girls, with a sweet face, said, her eyes flicking to Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Admiration sparkled in her gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera's cheeks reddened at the comment, and she quickly responded, "Oh, no, Mr. Fitzgerald and I are just friends, really. We're not dating, so don't get any ideas."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera felt a little embarrassed by the suggestion. She had never been confident enough to think that someone like Marcus would be interested in her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, she came from a modest background, and the idea of dating someone like him&mdash;powerful, wealthy&mdash;seemed out of her league.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From the first moment they met, Kiera was swept away by Marcus' commanding presence and his near-magical skills in medicine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Especially the way he treated her, which had felt so intimate, leaving her heart racing even now when she thought about it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera had known from that moment that she had developed feelings for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But her own insecurities kept her from expressing those feelings, and she buried them deep inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, with the girl's comment, Kiera felt those feelings bubbling to the surface, impossible to suppress.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Come on, Kiera, stop being so modest. If you were just friends, would he really be </span><span>going out of his way to help you like this? Just admit it already, when are you two getting married? You better let us know, so we can be your bridesmaids!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another girl teased, a knowing smile in her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, seriously, Kiera. You've got a boyfriend, and you didn't even tell us? And he's so amazing&mdash;lucky you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The rest of the girls joined in with playful banter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera's face flushed an even deeper shade of red.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Realizing there was no way to explain herself without feeling more embarrassed, she finally said, "I really should get going. Let's hang out another time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, she quickly slid into Marcus' Aston Martin.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus got in after her, started the car, and drove off smoothly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they watched the car speed away, the girls couldn't help but stare in envy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most of them came from average families, their parents working regular jobs and never having seen anyone as wealthy as Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What made it even more amazing was that he was dating one of their own friends&mdash;Kiera.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera didn't know what her friends were thinking, but she could feel her nerves getting the better of her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She kept her head down in the car, avoiding eye contact, feeling unsure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's on your mind?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus asked, breaking the silence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera hesitated for a moment before finally lifting her gaze, still blushing. "Oh, it's nothing... Thank you so much for today, Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><div class="pagination">
