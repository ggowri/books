  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Allan made a gesture for everyone to be quiet and answered the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hello, Mr. Dawson, I'm out handling something. Is there something you need?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A deep voice from a middle-aged man came through the other end of the line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you out handling things during working hours? Allan, do you even care about your job? How many times have I told you that your work attitude needs to be serious? The competition for your position is fierce. Since you're not listening, you don't have to come to work tomorrow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Allan's expression darkened, and he hurriedly explained, "Mr. Dawson, please listen. I asked for leave this morning, and to make sure it didn't affect my work, I finished everything for today, last Saturday. Have you forgotten?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although both of Allan's parents worked for the government, he had never relied on them. Allan had worked hard on his own to rise to his position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Allan thought, "Years of hard work weren't easy, yet Mr. Dawson was now threatening to fire me for something trivial."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't care. Your attitude towards work has been an issue lately. I've already reported this to the chairman, Mr. Dixon. Come in tomorrow to collect your salary, and then you can leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Also, your wife's stall is being taken back too. You two can get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aaron didn't want to listen to Allan's explanation and hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Allan's expression collapsed utterly. He felt like the sky had fallen, almost fainting from the shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Allan, what happened? Why do you look so pale?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lisa noticed something was wrong and quickly asked Allan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I... I've been fired. Aaron also said he's taking back your stall, too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Allan said, his expression was full of misery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lisa felt dizzy as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This news was like a bolt from the blue for both of them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Allan, you've been doing such a good job. Why would Mr. Dawson fire you? Since you've taken over, the wholesale market has been running smoothly. I'm sure Mr. Dixon has noticed that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lisa said with frustration, standing up for Allan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He's only firing me because he's got Mr. Dixon's approval. Otherwise, Aaron doesn't have the authority to do this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Allan's face was grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick and Aria, as well as Richard and Melinda, had more or less understood what had happened, and their faces darkened as well after hearing their conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't understand why Mr. Dixon always sides with Aaron," Lisa said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If Allan gets fired, we're finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>My stall will be taken back, too. We'll have no way of making money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>We still have nearly ten thousand in mortgage payments every month. I don't know what we're going to do," Lisa thought to herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Aaron not only has a ten percent stake in the wholesale market, but he also gave his daughter to Mr. Dixon, that old pervert. Of course, Mr. Dixon favors him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If it weren't for this, the position of general manager would have been mine long ago!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He's scheming to fire me because he has a nephew who recently left a foreign company's clothing business. Now he's eyeing my position as vice manager at the wholesale market, preparing to take over!" Allan growled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing Allan's words, Lisa's expression became even worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lisa thought, "So Aaron is holding onto the general manager position through favors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He's trying to push his nephew into the position, greedy and insatiable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Allan, what should we do? Do we just let Aaron get away with it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lisa said, her face filled with dissatisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, she felt that the world was terribly unfair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She also felt a deep sense of helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Aaron has the chairman backing him. I really can't do anything about it. It looks like I'll just go collect my pay and leave tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Allan sighed, his expression firming up with resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Lisa, don't worry. Even if I leave this company, I'll apply to other companies and work hard to support you and take care of our parents!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Allan really had a sense of responsibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And it was clear that he genuinely cared for Lisa, and this care extended to Nick and Aria as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's the name of your wholesale market?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Marcus' voice came through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone froze for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Allan replied, "Builder Market."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow, thinking to himself, "Builder Market... That must be something from the 1980s."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was established when Golden Group was first founded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It once contributed to a third of Golden Group's overall revenue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Golden Group diversified and expanded its business,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Builder Market gradually faded from their focus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even so, Builder Market remained a pillar of Golden Group.</span></p><div class="pagination">
