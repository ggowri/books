  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're a brave one, huh? You actually dared to hit me. Just wait. Even if I can't get back at you today, I'll make sure to beat you so badly your own mother wouldn't recognize you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man, holding his nose, retreated cautiously while glaring at Marcus, not forgetting to throw out his threats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, he disappeared into the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't pay attention to the man. Instead, he turned and helped Chloe, who was still sobbing on the ground, to her feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps she was too heartbroken as Chloe continued to sob uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus took out a tissue from his pocket and gently wiped away her tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling overwhelmed with emotion, Chloe suddenly threw herself into Marcus' arms, crying even harder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the sweet scent of her body reached Marcus, he suddenly felt a little uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hands seemed to have nowhere to go, but eventually, he placed them on Chloe's silky hair and gently stroked it. "Don't cry," he said softly. "People like him, addicted to drugs, have lost their conscience. Even if he's your brother, you shouldn't bother with him anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giving him money just encourages him to keep using drugs. It's harmful to both you and him. It'll only lead to more trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe, with her hands wrapped around Marcus' broad waist, sobbed as she spoke, "If he doesn't stop using, he'll die. After all, he's my brother, the only family I have in this world. No matter how bad he is, I can't bear to see him die..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Foolish girl."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said, feeling that Chloe was being too naive. He tried to comfort her, "Look at him. He's not at the point where he'll die without drugs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he were, he wouldn't have the strength to come threaten you, and he wouldn't have had the energy to fight me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's just using your weakness to get you to give him money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing Marcus' words, Chloe seemed to relax a little. She looked up from his broad chest, looking up at him with her tear-streaked face, asking, "Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I wouldn't lie to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled and reassured her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you hit him. He'll definitely come back to get revenge. He's involved with a drug gang. Besides selling drugs, they're all criminals. I'm worried they might come after you in the dark..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe said with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled, "Don't worry. They can't hurt me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe looked uneasy. "You should leave. I feel like he'll be back soon, and I don't want to drag you into this..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew her brother's temper all too well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Marcus had hit him, he would certainly bring people to get revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not leaving. I'm handling this today. I'll help you with this trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some reason, hearing Chloe's cries earlier made his heartache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he felt deep sympathy for the girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally understood why Chloe always seemed so melancholic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't like other girls her age, so lively and full of energy. Instead, she always seemed distant and hard to approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out she carried this hidden burden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any other girl in her twenties might have been broken under such pressure, but Chloe hadn't only endured it. She had also fought her way through the entertainment industry with no connections or financial backing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Step by step, she had risen to become a rising star in the industry. It truly felt like an inspiring story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, this girl refused to engage in any kind of underhanded dealings to get this far. One could only imagine the hardships she had faced.</span></p><div class="pagination">
