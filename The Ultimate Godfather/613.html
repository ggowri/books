  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, how was it? How did you like our little duo?" Jane took a deep breath, her face flushed, beads of sweat still glistening on her forehead, her eyes sultry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus stayed silent, and Pearl, wrapping herself in a towel, quickly dashed into the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's still a bit shy, the first time and all. I told you she likes you, but you didn't believe me," Jane chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm caught in your trap now." Marcus shot her a look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane rolled her eyes. "Honestly, you really don't know a good thing when you see it. Without me, when would you ever get a taste of something like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus felt a wave of frustration. Jane's words left him speechless. The experience had certainly been unlike anything Marcus had ever had, and even now, he couldn't help but reminisce about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Pearl was done with her shower, she quietly slipped out of the room, seemingly too shy to face Marcus. Marcus knew she was probably embarrassed. He didn't pay </span><span>much attention to </span><span>it, quickly showering himself before heading out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These past few days, Diana had been busy working on upgrading the guns. After all the effort, Marcus' guns from Solariae were almost all upgraded now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy crystals he bought in the southwestern Uswad region were originally enough for about 1,800 guns. Still, after defeating Phoenix and Asher, he gathered more energy crystals and used them for the upgrades. This bumped the total number of upgraded guns to about 2,500.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few days ago, when Marcus returned to Solomia from Kingston, the Axe Gang received 100 energy crystal micro submachine guns from Marcus. Blake and Baron were over the moon and immediately tested the firepower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the guns weren't quite on par with Marcus' weapon, they were still enough to outclass any advanced guns on the market. These 100 guns significantly boosted the Axe Gang's strength, allowing them to crush their rivals, the Flying Daggers, in a fierce battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader of the Flying Daggers, Maxen Blackwell, practiced Ancient Martial Art and was on the brink of breaking through to Stage Two. He was known as the top expert in Kingston's underground world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally, Blake would have been cautious about Maxen. But this time, thanks to the energy crystal submachine gun, Blake killed Maxen with a single shot. The Flying Daggers instantly lost their fighting spirit and surrendered to the Axe Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, the Axe Gang officially became the number one gang in Kingston's underground world. Before this, although the Axe Gang had some influence, they never ranked higher than 4th or 5th in terms of overall strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But since aligning with Marcus, the gang had undergone a complete transformation. They defeated the Celestial Arc Order-backed Dragon Tiger Hall in a firefight and then crushed the Flying Daggers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they firmly held the top spot. Blake knew that his rapid rise had everything to do with his submission to Marcus. In other words, everything he had now was thanks to Marcus. This only deepened the respect and loyalty Blake and Baron had for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, wasn't paying much attention to these developments. As </span><span>the number of guns </span><span>Diana</span><span> had modified</span><span> increased, he also supplied Serpent's Coil with 200 guns. With the constant increase in magic levels among Serpent's Coil members, the group had quietly grown into a force to be reckoned with&mdash;strong and full of potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was lounging in the yard, enjoying the sun, when his phone buzzed with a message from Jade on WhatsApp. After a quick glance, he realized today was Jade's birthday.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Marcus had gotten involved with Jade, he hadn't actually remembered her birthday. Jade had messaged to invite him to a dinner party with some of her close friends. As her official boyfriend, Marcus knew he couldn't miss it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about it, Marcus quickly got ready, picked out a nice outfit, and headed out. He couldn't show up without a gift for Jade's birthday.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He drove to the largest luxury mall in Solomia, looking for a top-tier gem customization shop. He wanted to buy her a custom-made gemstone necklace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shop's gems were the finest in the world, and top jewelers from abroad handcrafted each piece of jewelry. Although the store didn't have a specific brand, the value of its items far exceeded any ordinary luxury goods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a quick scan of the store, Marcus saw that even the simplest gemstone ring started at over 100 thousand Uswadian coins. One particularly dazzling sapphire necklace was priced at 18.88 million Uswadian coins. For most people, the cost of such jewels was astronomical.</span></p><div class="pagination">
