  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus instinctively glanced inside the car dealership, thinking that the reason the salesperson stopped them was due to too many customers inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after looking around, he realized there were no other customers in the dealership.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since there were no customers, theoretically, the dealership should attend to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked, "There are no other customers in your store. Why can't you serve us? We want to test drive the new Aventador, and if it meets our expectations, we want to purchase it today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The new Lamborghini Aventador had just launched in Uswad this year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because the new model included an electrification system, Marcus was worried that the driving experience would differ from previous models, so he wanted Natalia to test drive it first before making a decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when Marcus and Natalia were full of anticipation, the saleswoman said, "I'm sorry sir, but the Lamborghini dealership is a high-end car store and only serves customers who have made appointments. Since you don't have an appointment, we cannot assist you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing the ridiculous remarks from the saleswoman, Natalia couldn't help but ask, "Why? We really want to buy a car. Are you not able to serve customers?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss, the starting price for the new Aventador is eight million Uswadian coins, and with various options, it totals around 15 million. Are you sure you can afford that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The saleswoman crossed her arms and swept her gaze over Marcus and Natalia, a hint of disdain flashing in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her actions were mainly not because of the store's policy but because she felt Marcus and Natalia seemed a bit unreliable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had dealt with numerous clients before, including some top-tier wealthy individuals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even those top-tier wealthy buyers rarely paid on the same day they decided to buy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most people compared several brands and did extensive research before making a purchase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, an Aventador was indeed not cheap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, after listening to Marcus and Natalia, the saleswoman fundamentally concluded that they were just bragging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She believed Marcus and Natalia just wanted to take the opportunity to test drive the new Aventador and then post pictures on social media to show off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were plenty of such people. They were not real customers at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, the saleswoman didn't bother to engage with Marcus and Natalia any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Natalia immediately got angry. "How do you know we can't afford it? You are a service representative. Isn't this a violation of basic service principles in sales?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The saleswoman dropped her pretenses and said, "You can't afford it. This is Lamborghini's Aventador, a top sports car, not a toy. Miss, you'd better assess your financial capabilities before yelling at me. You're wasting my time with important customers. Please leave now and don't delay my business."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, the saleswoman turned to walk away, no longer paying attention to Marcus and Natalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a group of people entered the dealership.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leading them was a young man dressed in top luxury brands, looking quite stylish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He exuded wealth, clearly indicating he was affluent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beside that young man was a mature-looking girl with an influencer's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wore a sparkling jumpsuit, and her long, smooth legs were visible beneath it. The sound of her delicate high heels clicked as if she were a model.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing the young man, surprise immediately crossed the saleswoman's exquisite face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wilder, what brings you here? Didn't you just pick up an Aventador a few days ago?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man casually glanced at Marcus and Natalia before saying to the saleswoman, "I'm planning to buy Lara another Aventador to make it easier for her to go to the set."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The saleswoman beamed with delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man's name was Ronan Wilder, the son of the vice president of BioFusion Pharmaceuticals, worth billions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although this amount of money wasn't considered significant in Kingston's wealthy circle, Ronan's spending was quite generous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a few days ago, he had bought a new Aventador through that saleswoman, and now he was looking to buy another one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The saleswoman earned a commission of 100,000 Uswadian coins for every new Aventador sold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For someone like her, with a monthly salary of 20,000 to 30,000 Uswadian coins, that was no small sum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, she was very eager to assist a client like Ronan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Even though Ronan didn't make an appointment, he is a genuine potential customer. Those two guys who can't afford a car want to test drive a top luxury car and take pictures to show off. They aren't worth my time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman standing beside Ronan was a popular influencer named Lara Stone, with tens of millions of followers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recently, Lara signed with Stellar Entertainment, a company under Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Stellar Entertainment was not the top entertainment company in Uswad, it had been gaining momentum in recent years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many low-budget films produced by Stellar Entertainment received good box office and critical acclaim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Stellar Entertainment even signed with top artists like Lila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It could be said that Stellar Entertainment was a very promising media company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Ronan backing her, Lara would likely become famous soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about this, the saleswoman couldn't help but feel envious. She wished to find a boyfriend like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The saleswoman exclaimed, "Mr. Wilder, you are so good to Ms. Stone, truly attentive. I really admire that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just so happens we have a blue Aventador, the top configuration. That car suits Ms. Stone's temperament perfectly, and she will definitely like it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing the salesperson's words, both Ronan and Lara's eyes lit up. Ronan said, "We also like the blue Aventador. Since Lara just got her license and her driving skills aren't great, the top configuration is the most suitable for her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronan was indeed wealthy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luxury cars often come with many impractical configurations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally, people wouldn't pay for expensive and non-functional features when buying a car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ronan didn't even glance at the configuration list and simply wanted to make the purchase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wilder, you are so nice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara linked her arm with Ronan's, resting her head on his shoulder, showcasing a sweet smile, radiating happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronan affectionately replied, "You're my woman. I must treat you well. I want you to drive luxury cars and live in mansions, and I'll help you become a top actress."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like Marcus and Natalia, they had just bought a house and came to the car dealership to buy a car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the saleswoman began to lead Ronan and Lara to look at cars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This infuriated Natalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because she particularly liked the blue Aventador as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blue was the main color for the Aventador, and Natalia had dreamed of driving that car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So she couldn't help but question the saleswoman, "Excuse me, they didn't make an appointment either and arrived later than us. Why are you serving them but not us?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
