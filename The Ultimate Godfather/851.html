  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd did not expect that Marcus actually dared to challenge. They thought, "Could he really drink five bottles of </span><span>Everclear</span><span> in one go? How is that possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their understanding, two or three bottles of </span><span>Everclear</span><span> were already the limit for an average person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A normal person, if they consumed five bottles of </span><span>Everclear</span><span>, would either be dead or in the ICU.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, even if Marcus could drink five bottles of </span><span>Everclear</span><span>, he would definitely not be Nolan's match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five bottles of </span><span>Everclear</span><span> were just a piece of cake for Nolan. If Marcus drank five bottles, he would surely lose his ability to fight, even if he didn't end up in the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, there was still a considerable gap in their strengths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Marcus got drunk by Nolan, Nolan's purpose would be achieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about this, the crowd unintentionally glanced at Melina's perfect figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They sighed to themselves, "Such a beautiful girl might end up under Nolan tonight. Just thinking about it makes me envious and anxious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan disdainfully glanced at Marcus and said, "Are you sure you want to compete with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold smile, Nolan's gaze was filled with arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why not?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus remained calm. He looked at the wine glasses on the table and said to Nolan, "But these glasses are not big enough. Change them for bigger ones."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he said this, the crowd was once again shocked, thinking, "He's insane, actually asking for larger glasses. This is too overconfident. He's not even Nolan's opponent, yet he wants bigger glasses. Is he afraid of getting drunk too slowly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan laughed, "Interesting, I've never seen anyone ask for larger glasses. I will accommodate you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan summoned the waiter into the private room and instructed, "Bring two larger glasses."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The waiter apologetically replied, "Sorry, Mr. Watson. These are the largest wine glasses we have."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the waiter could finish, Nolan interrupted, "Then bring beer mugs instead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under normal circumstances, a beer mug has a capacity of about five hundred milliliters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This means that a beer mug can almost hold an entire bottle of </span><span>Everclear</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The audience had never heard of anyone drinking </span><span>Everclear</span><span> from a beer mug. It was simply outrageous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The waiter was also taken aback, somewhat shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he did not dare to disobey and hurriedly ran out of the private room. A short while later, he returned with two brand-new beer mugs at the dining table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan took the beer mug and showed it to Marcus, saying, "Is this big enough?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus remained expressionless and said, "That's about right."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saying this, he took out a bottle of </span><span>Everclear</span><span>, opened the cap, and poured the entire </span><span>bottle into the beer mug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene made everyone's scalp tingle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They struggled to down 150 milliliters of </span><span>Everclear</span><span>. Marcus and Nolan were actually going to drink </span><span>Everclear</span><span> from 500-milliliter beer mugs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people took out their phones, trying to record this shocking moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, isn't this mug a bit too big? You shouldn't do this," Melina warned Marcus with a worried expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's fine, just enjoy the show," Marcus reassured Melina with a comforting glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus filling the beer mug with </span><span>Everclear</span><span>, Nolan was unwilling to fall behind. He also picked up a bottle of </span><span>Everclear</span><span> and filled his beer mug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he lifted the beer mug and poured it into his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd only heard the continuous gulping sounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Nolan's throat moved, he finished a full 500 milliliters of </span><span>Everclear</span><span> just like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan showed no reaction and licked his lips in satisfaction, eyeing Marcus, "Kid, it's your turn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people watched in horror. They had never seen anyone drink </span><span>Everclear</span><span> like this. It was incredibly thrilling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at Nolan, then quietly activated his X-ray vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He discovered that Nolan was able to chug down 500 milliliters of </span><span>Everclear</span><span> because he used Numinous Energy to vaporize the alcohol and expel it from his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant that while Nolan appeared to drink </span><span>Everclear</span><span>, it was virtually the same as drinking water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this ability was not something all warriors could possess. At least lower-level warriors could not master such skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan was capable of this due to the cultivation method he practiced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus used his X-ray vision to examine and discern that Nolan's method originated from the Swords Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were waves of sword energy coursing through his body, emitting a sharp aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cultivation method he practiced was a type of Inhalation method, extremely mysterious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the method sounded complex, within two seconds Marcus understood everything about Nolan clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The alcohol vaporized and lingered in the air, which was precisely why there was such a strong scent of alcohol in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After figuring out Nolan's trick, Marcus did not hesitate and downed a glass of </span><span>Everclear</span><span> in one go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he had not practiced Nolan's extraordinary method, as a powerful Return Essence stage warrior, he could freely release Numinous Energy, thus easily refining the alcohol entering his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the domineering aspect of having high-level strength. Although Marcus had not practiced a method similar to Nolan's, he could still use the powerful Numinous Energy in his body to refine and break down the alcohol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, after finishing a glass, Marcus felt completely unburdened, and even seemed more composed than Nolan, managing to drink alcohol as if it were water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene left everyone present dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never expected Marcus to have such a good alcohol tolerance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, they did not think too highly of Marcus. After all, this was just the beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some ordinary people with good alcohol tolerance could also down a bottle of </span><span>Everclear</span><span> if they went all out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were still four bottles of </span><span>Everclear</span><span> waiting for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan applauded Marcus and said, "Impressive. I hope you can keep it up. Don't let me down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saying this, Nolan opened another bottle, poured it into the glass, and downed it again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, just like before, he quickly vaporized and decomposed the </span><span>Everclear</span><span> using his method, keeping himself completely sober.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan arrogantly stated, "Very refreshing. Kid, it's your turn again. You did impress me. But if you can take no more, surrender. I won't make it difficult for you. I just want you to leave the private room and let Melina stay here with us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While speaking, Nolan glanced at Melina again, his eyes filled with greed.</span></p><div class="pagination">
