  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna's reaction amused Marcus. He asked, "Are you going to attack me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her azure eyes betrayed her pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her previous silence was due to her disdain for associating with those whom she considered beneath her.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their distinct backgrounds led to varying cognition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna was unwilling to waste her time with the lowly people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they actually dared to frame Albert. She must avenge him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not going to tell me, are you? Then don't blame me for being ruthless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Luna beckoned to those armed men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They promptly stepped forward and surrounded Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader, a Westoner clutching an iron rod, growled with an icy face, "How dare you offend Ms. Perez? You will regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, he forcefully swung the iron rod towards Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching the scene, Albert instantly gloated, waiting for Marcus to be beaten up by these people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, facing the siege of a great number of people, Marcus remained unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even charged into the crowd and continuously pummeled them with his fists that were as large as sandbags.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Muffled bangs rang out nonstop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus unleashed his Fist Ray, an incessant stream of screams echoed through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In mere seconds, he single-handedly knocked every one of those armed Westoners to the floor, where they were moaning in distress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene immediately dumbfounded everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of them had expected Marcus to be so powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder he remained so calm when facing a large number of people encircling him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at Luna and Albert and sneered, "Given such a meager level of strength, how dare you be so cocky in my presence?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert said, "Luna, this guy is too arrogant. It seems that we can only ask Ms. McHale for help!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His statement reminded Luna, and she immediately nodded to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she said to Marcus, "If you're brave enough, stay right here. I'll have Ms. McHale teach you a harsh lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus narrowed his eyes slightly, remained fearless, and replied, "Don't worry, I'll stay here. I'm curious to find out what kind of formidable individual you can summon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no desire to stir up trouble, yet Luna and Albert took the initiative to provoke him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His restraint didn't equate to timidity. Given that Luna and Albert were being so overbearing, it was justifiable for him to deal with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Worried that Marcus might suffer, Jade hurriedly urged, "Marcus, don't bother with them. Let's leave now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved his hand to her and said, "Don't worry. I can handle it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna soon hung up and, wearing a smug expression, said to Marcus, "What a coincidence! Ms. McHale is in the vicinity and will be here in five minutes. Don't run away. Wait for her to teach you a lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words caused everyone's heart to skip a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, someone deduced the identity of the lady Luna had talked about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It should be Cecilia McHale, the daughter of the chairman of the McHale Pharmaceuticals Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Cecilia! She has come to Uswad as well. Luna wants her to deal with Marcus. He's really in a tough spot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! Cecilia is the princess of the McHale Pharmaceuticals Group. Her standing is far superior to Luna's. Relying solely on her own clout, she'll make Marcus pay dearly. His fate is sealed. He's about to face Cecilia's fury!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone burst into discussion, all believing that once Cecilia arrived, Marcus would be completely destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Jade was part of the medical system, it was natural that she had heard of Cecilia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing how powerful the McHale Pharmaceuticals Group was, she immediately became worried about Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. McHale will be here soon. If you regret it, apologize to me right now. Maybe I will beg Ms. McHale to show mercy to you because you are Jade's boyfriend. Otherwise, you're bound to rue the day," Albert declared proudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was aware of the power that Cecilia controlled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, she made a low-profile visit to Uswad to take part in a medical seminar and declined all forms of receptions organized by the media and government officials.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, her arrival would surely cause a sensation in Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the mayor would receive her personally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If such an influential figure like Cecilia truly lost her temper and launched an attack on Marcus, it would take merely a few minutes to kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus simply ignored Albert, which caused him to grit his teeth in annoyance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, the door of the room was pushed open again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several people walked in, led by a blonde girl with green eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her age was comparable to Luna's, but in terms of appearance and temperament, she outshone Luna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next to her was a bearded Westoner.</span></p><div class="pagination">
