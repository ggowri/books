        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course it's true. I have no reason to lie," Marcus replied lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raphael's eyes flickered, and he bowed to Marcus, his expression earnest. "I dare to ask Mr. Fitzgerald for help in freeing my tribe from the Cursed Power. Would you be willing to assist us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, hope sparked in the eyes of the Nuer Tribe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had suffered from the Cursed Power for years, and its removal would feel like a new beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, everyone looked at Marcus expectantly, hoping that he would agree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a Nuer Tribe member rushed into the castle, panic in his voice. "Mr. Stewart, urgent news! The Shark Tribe has come to challenge us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raphael's mood darkened. "How many are there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man replied, "The chief, deputy chief, and other high-ranking figures of the Shark Tribe are all here. There are more than a thousand of them in total. They are now challenging us outside our tribe. Mr. Stewart, what should we do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raphael's expression turned grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Shark Tribe had invaded this underwater world a thousand years ago, seeking to monopolize the space-time gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As its guardians, the Nuer Tribe naturally fought back hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in terms of overall strength, the Shark Tribe was stronger, while the people of the Nuer Tribe have been suffering from illness for many years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the struggle between the two major tribes, they had always been at a disadvantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only relying on the tribe's last means of survival, they had been able to occupy the space-time gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the space-time gate set to open in three days, the Shark Tribe's challenge felt more formidable than ever, with their leaders present, a rare occurrence in the past millennium.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Space-Time Gate opens in three days, and the Shark Tribe intends to claim its power. As guardians, we are resolute in defending its sovereignty to the death. Nuer Tribe soldiers, do you have the confidence?" Raphael </span><span>declared,</span><span> his steely gaze fixed </span><span>on the Nuer Tribe leaders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Nuer Tribe leaders' faces were grim with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They raised their arms, shouting in unison, "We will defend the sovereignty of the space-time gate to the death and drive out all invaders!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raphael's expression softened with gratitude, and he quickly activated the Nuer Tribe's alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the Nuer Tribe was mobilized, all standing at attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There is an invasion of foreign enemies, and today's battle is inevitable. The matter of life and death for our tribe. Time is short to protect Mr. Fitzgerald, and I hope you can forgive me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have an amulet that leads to the top of the undersea rift. If danger arises, you can reach safety by crushing it," Raphael said, looking at Marcus as he handed him an amulet from his pocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved it away, saying, "The Shark Tribe has already activated the Great Formation of Confinement to seal this undersea world, seemingly intent on wiping us out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Under the confinement formation, the amulet won't work. I'll go out with you to assess the situation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Raphael quickly used his spiritual powers to probe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He confirmed Marcus' words. The Shark Tribe had set up an invisible confinement array sealing the entire underwater world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During its activation, nothing could leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, even if he wanted to send Marcus to a safe area, he couldn't do it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raphael's expression turned apologetic. "Mr. Fitzgerald, I'm sorry. This is our Nuer Tribe's issue. I've dragged you into it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But don't worry, I will protect your safety, even if it costs me my life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest of the Nuer Tribe echoed his sentiment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had already saved Nadia, making him a benefactor to the tribe, and they were committed to safeguarding him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia and Susan approached Marcus, worry etched on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia said, "Mr. Fitzgerald, I've leveled up. When the war breaks out, I'll protect you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her determination was evident as she sought to shield him from danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To the Nuer Tribe, Marcus was merely a human with exceptional medical skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He likely needed their protection due to his limited combat abilities, and he appreciated their gratitude, responsibility, and courage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Raphael led the Nuer Tribe's leaders out of the castle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the castle was an extremely spacious giant square.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thousands of tribe members had gathered there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both men and women displayed remarkably consistent expressions, resolute in their readiness to die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had protected this underwater realm for millennia, battling various forces without yielding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the past thousand years, the Shark Tribe has invaded, initiating a prolonged </span><span>conflict with the Nuer Tribe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the Shark Tribe surrounded them, riding fearsome undersea beasts radiating a murderous aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One beast, the largest, had thick scales and razor-sharp teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus froze at the sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before coming to the Nuer tribe, he had encountered a collective siege by five sea monsters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the sea monster leading the Shark Tribe was somewhat similar to those he had killed before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But both in size and momentum, they were much worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The five sea monsters that Marcus killed were obviously much more powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nuer Tribe, listen! The Shark Tribe's elites are here to seize the space-time gate. We've set a dragnet. If you wish to live, kneel and submit! Serve the Shark Tribe as slaves, and you will be spared!" a tall figure with dangerous eyes declared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body bore scale armor like the beasts, exuding terror.</span></p></div>
