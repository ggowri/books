  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Golden Hotel was packed with people attending the general manager selection conference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Golden Group's really top-tier. Look at all these big shots from Solomia!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail stared at the lineup of luxury cars, buzzing with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without Felix's invite, she'd never have gotten into something this fancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone's here to kiss up to the new chairman, someone said he'd come," Felix </span><span>replied</span><span> casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail's eyes sparkled. "Golden Group's new chairman? He must be someone incredible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What, want to meet him?" Felix smirked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Obviously!" she gushed. "Who in Solomia wouldn't?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well," Felix puffed up importantly, "he's actually an old friend of mine. Once I'm general manager, I'll introduce you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix bragged shamelessly, confident as if he could bluff his way past Abigail's expectations later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, Mr. Yannis, you're amazing!" Abigail squealed, kissing his cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">A connection to the Golden Group's chairman would definitely put the Winchester family on top.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Dumping that useless Marcus and getting close to Felix was the wisest choice I'd ever made.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That loser can get out of my life forever!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did she know, the chairman she was so desperate to meet was Marcus - her husband of three years whom she'd written off as worthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail clung to Felix's arm, beaming as they approached the entrance with their invitations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then a familiar figure appeared, walking toward them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mar... Marcus? Is that... is he a ghost?" Abigail stammered, her face pale with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix, more composed, studied the figure before sneering. "Well, It's really that loser. Can't believe he's still alive. How could he even survive that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After her shock wore off, Abigail's eyes turned to ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, this is the Golden Group's general manager selection conference. What's trash like you doing here? Get lost before you embarrass my family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus shot them a disgusted look. "If you two are allowed in, why can't I be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had bigger things to deal with today. These shameless scumbags weren't worth his time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm the deputy general manager of Golden Group, I belong here," Felix interjected smugly. "But you? A worthless nobody. How dare you show up here and talk to me like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll count to three," Abigail snapped, "and you'd better leave. Or else it gets messy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disdain on their faces couldn't have been clearer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus just ignored them, pulling out a black card and handing it to the hostess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hostess smiled and said politely, "I'm sorry, sir. You'll need an invitation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Felix and Abigail burst into mocking laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at this loser trying to crash the </span><span>day</span><span>!" Abigail sneered. "Did you really think that fake card would work?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is Golden Group's Supreme Card," Marcus said coolly. "I don't blame you for not knowing. After all, It's a bit above your pay grade."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix was momentarily stunned, and then he snorted. "Supreme Card? Never heard of it. What a good joke."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail hung on Felix's arm</span><span> quickly</span><span>, soothing him. "Don't waste your time on him, Mr. Yannis. He's just jealous of us and wants to make a scene."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Marcus with a smirk. "Get lost, loser. That worthless card won't help you here. Leave before security throws you out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, and FYI," she bragged, "Mr. Yannis isn't just getting the general manager position</span><span> today</span><span> - he's also besties with the new chairman. He's introducing us later. That's someone you'll never be important enough to meet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The new chairman's his friend? Are you sure about that?" Marcus's lips twitched with amusement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't recall ever being Felix's friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course!" Abigail lifted her chin. "Mr. Yannis knows everyone who matters. Once I meet the chairman, my family's set for life. By then, you'll be nothing but dirt beneath my shoes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Face it - we're in different leagues now. Stop trying to win me back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus barely held back his laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Abigail, how did I never notice you were this stupid before?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But you're right about one thing - we are indeed in different leagues</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> now</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Because you're not even fit to polish my shoes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Can't wait to see your face when you find out I'm the chairman you're so desperate to meet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Security!" Felix barked. "Get this trash out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guards with batons rushed forward as Abigail watched eagerly, ready for the show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"WAIT!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the guards could move, the hotel manager hurried over, looking panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The group just informed us a distinguished guest with a Supreme Card would be attending. May I ask who it is?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
