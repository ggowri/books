        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because the Great E</span><span>poch</span><span> </span><span>was</span><span> approaching.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, the world's rules w</span><span>ould</span><span> change.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The rulers of various continents </span><span>were restless</span><span>, trying to seize the advantage and claim more resources before the Great </span><span>Epoch</span><span> arrive</span><span>d</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And after the world's rules change, all existing order w</span><span>ould</span><span> be disrupted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the barriers between major continents w</span><span>ould</span><span> weaken with the rule changes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, as the Great </span><span>Epoch arrived</span><span>, countless opportunities w</span><span>ould</span><span> emerge across all continents.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, many destinies w</span><span>ould</span><span> </span><span>be rewritten</span><span>, and a new group of kings w</span><span>ould</span><span> rise, making their mark across the continents.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They may even replace the continent's former rulers, holding the power of life and death over it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the rules change</span><span>d</span><span>, the world within the </span><span>Ice Wall</span><span>, once seen as a cage by them, </span><span>wa</span><span>s also likely to give birth to many new opportunities.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, not only on the Lemuriat, but people from other continents also beg</span><span>a</span><span>n to stir.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The</span><span>y</span><span> captur</span><span>ed</span><span> young girls in the </span><span>Solomia</span><span> </span><span>not because of</span><span> an order from </span><span>Roderick</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instead, it was </span><span>because of a</span><span> vanguard </span><span>called</span><span> </span><span>River Banks</span><span> who came to this world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>According to the elder's notes, </span><span>Rivers cultivated</span><span> a sinister technique that consum</span><span>ed</span><span> the blood of young women to enhance his cultivation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, after arriving in this world, </span><span>Rivers</span><span> ordered his subordinates to capture some young women for his cultivation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This led to the recent cases of young women disappearing in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The </span><span>G</span><span>reat </span><span>Epoch.</span><span> </span><span>T</span><span>he world's rules </span><span>will change</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at the contents of the elder's notes, </span><span>Marcus</span><span> seemed lost in thought.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If what </span><span style="font-style: italic;">he</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> said is true, then more and more invaders will arrive in this world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">All the previous tranquility and peace will also be shattered after these invaders arrive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, </span><span>Marcus</span><span> couldn't help but feel a sense of urgency.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew he must grow fully before the </span><span>Great Epoch</span><span> arrives.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only in this way c</span><span>ould</span><span> he protect himself after the world's rules change</span><span>d</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, he </span><span>could</span><span> better protect those around him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The notes don't </span><span style="font-style: italic;">tell</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> the exact time </span><span style="font-style: italic;">when the Great Epoch will arrive</span><span style="font-style: italic;">, but the sudden appearance of </span><span style="font-style: italic;">the Ophidian</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> in this world</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> suggests the time is near</span><span style="font-style: italic;">. I must quickly enhance my personal strength!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus</span><span> thought to himself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie</span><span> said, "For thousands of years, people in our world have been endlessly longing for the world beyond the </span><span>Ice Wall</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Many even risked their lives to explore the world beyond the </span><span>Ice Wall</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who would have thought that after the arrival of the </span><span>Great Epoch</span><span>, the barriers between worlds would completely weaken, and</span><span> what was unattainable</span><span> might soon be easily accessible."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus</span><span> nodded and said, "In theory, that's true, but the sudden weakening of the barriers might not be a good thing for the people of this world. They've grown accustomed to this peaceful and stable life."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, the world beyond the </span><span>Ice Wall</span><span> is certainly harsher than this one, with countless unknown dangers. If they venture there recklessly, </span><span>they will pay a heavy cost</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie</span><span> agreed with </span><span>Marcus</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>She</span><span> said calmly, "This </span><span>Great Epoch</span><span> is beyond our control. By the way, does the notebook mention where those girls are being held?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus</span><span> nodded and said, "</span><span>Yes</span><span>, but we don't know the situation on the other side. There might be danger. I'll go rescue those girls alone. Wait for my good news."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus</span><span> didn't want </span><span>Gertie</span><span> to take risks with him, as he had no idea how many people were on the other side or what level of strength each of them possessed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he rashly took </span><span>Gertie</span><span> along, it could very likely put her in danger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, as soon as </span><span>Marcus</span><span> finished speaking, </span><span>Gertie</span><span> hurriedly said, "No, I want to go with you. No matter how dangerous it is, I must go. You can't leave me behind!"</span></p></div>
