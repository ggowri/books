        <h1>Chapter 476 Freya's Despair</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Freya's face darkened; she hadn't expected Marcus to press her so relentlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What bet? I never agreed to any bet! Stop making things up!" she snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus chuckled coldly and casually explained the bet between him and Freya to Carter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Carter's expression turned icy. "Freya, we don't keep parasites in this hospital. Are you resigning, or should I fire you?" he asked bluntly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Freya felt dizzy and hurriedly said, "Mr. Lake, I trained in Acoton! Firing me would be a huge loss to the hospital. You should think this through!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Carter sneered, his face full of disdain. "You're threatening me with that? Tell me, could you have completed that surgery just now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Freya was speechless. Even with her overseas credentials, she knew she couldn't have handled that operation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you can't complete it, what's the point of your training in Acoton? The goal of training is to improve skills, not to earn an empty title!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since you won't resign, I'll formally fire you now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Freya looked utterly desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was a doctor who had trained in Acoton.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Solomia Hospital had excellent benefits, and her family was based in Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Losing this job might force her to leave her hometown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, other hospitals might not offer the same benefits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More importantly, she enjoyed her unchecked freedom here, but at another hospital, she'd likely have to start as a junior doctor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But it was too late now. Carter was firing her, and there was no way to change his mind. She could only accept her fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This left Freya full of regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She regretted going against Jade. If she hadn't teamed up with Jayden to ostracize her, she wouldn't have ended up in this situation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, do you have any further instructions? If so, just say the word, and I'll take care of everything," Carter asked Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Carter looked at Marcus as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was the first time Marcus had come to him for help, so Carter wanted to handle it flawlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A master healer like Marcus was someone he, even as a director, had to curry favor with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Marcus cured a late-stage cancer patient at their hospital, Solomia Hospital's reputation had grown significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had even risen two places in some professional rankings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These tangible benefits were all thanks to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus waved a hand dismissively and said, "I just hope no one else bullies my friends again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade felt a surge of gratitude. She hadn't expected Marcus to be looking out for her all this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Carter readily agreed, and Jade was promoted to department head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The doctors and nurses who had mocked her before now stood frozen in fear, their hearts full of anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she took over, they were likely in trouble!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was the ultimate turn of events&mdash;what goes around comes around!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Life's tides shift; don't underestimate anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone learned an important lesson&mdash;never bully anyone&mdash;you never know what they might become.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus, thank you," Jade said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She turned her face up to Marcus, her eyes brimming with gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was the first time she had smiled at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was also Marcus' first time seeing her smile. He hadn't expected her smile to be so beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She usually wore a serious expression, so very few people had probably ever seen her smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's nothing. We're friends, aren't we?" Marcus said casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He waved his hand nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Part of the reason he helped Jade was that he couldn't stand Jayden and Freya's shallow politics.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another reason was out of respect for Robert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More importantly, because he had killed Jordon, Jade had lost the opportunity to train in Acoton.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was why she had been reassigned to Solomia Hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He bore some indirect responsibility for her being ostracized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you really consider me a friend?" Jade asked, her eyes sparkling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What else? A girlfriend?" Marcus teased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade's cheeks turned red, and she shot him a fierce glare. "Don't joke around. You've got so many women around you&mdash;why would you be interested in me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And what if I really was?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade's cheeks flushed even redder, and her heart started racing for reasons she couldn't explain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since Jade had just completed a major surgery and was exhausted, she was able to clock out early.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade didn't own property in Solomia, so she lived in the hospital's dormitory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The dormitory was several miles from the inpatient wing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus started his Aston Martin, ready to drive Jade back to the dormitory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By the way, why did you transfer to Solomia Hospital?" Marcus asked as they drove.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I requested the transfer. Working under my dad in his department meant he handled everything, and I could never grow on my own," Jade explained.</span></p></div>
