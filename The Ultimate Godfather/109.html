  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The little girl being scolded was Josie's daughter, Leia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Audrey Torres, who had a landlord-like appearance, pulled away from Josie's grasp, placing her hands on her hips. "This little brat knocked my daughter over today. What's wrong with making her apologize?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beside Audrey stood another little girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This girl was chubby and looked like a miniature version of her mother!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even at five or six years old, she was dressed head-to-toe in designer brands, looking every bit like a nouveau riche child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If my daughter really did knock over yours, she can apologize. But you, as an adult, screaming at a child like this in public? That's unacceptable!" Josie retorted firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leia had grown up without a father, which left her withdrawn and deeply insecure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie knew her daughter well&mdash;Leia would never intentionally hurt someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Leia had accidentally knocked over the chubby girl, it wouldn't have been on purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, kids playing together at kindergarten often bumped into each other&mdash;it was perfectly normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Audrey was clearly making a mountain out of a molehill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Josie's response, Audrey snarled, "Then make your little brat apologize! If she messed up, she needs to kneel and apologize to my daughter. Right here, right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie's face turned bright red with anger. She shot back, "What you're doing is illegal! I can sue you for slander and violating personal dignity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Audrey let out a cold laugh. "Ha! You little tramp, don't think I don't know who you are. Aren't you Josie, the woman from BioFusion Pharmaceuticals?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sue me for slander? Keep dreaming. Do you know who my husband is? Just mentioning his name would scare you!" she boasted smugly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, with a triumphant smirk, she added, "Oh, that's right&mdash;you don't even have a husband. Your kid must be the result of some fling with a random man, huh? Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leia raised her tear-streaked face to Josie and asked, "Mom, am I really what the fat lady says I am&mdash;a bastard?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Leia's swollen cheek, Josie's heart broke. With tears in her eyes, she said, "Leia has a dad. He's just in another world now. Leia is not a bastard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leia's words were like a spark to a powder keg, enraging Audrey. "You little brat, who are you calling fat? You're kneeling today and apologizing to my daughter!" she shouted furiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She grabbed Leia's hair, trying to force her to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie tried to intervene, but Audrey was too strong. She shoved Josie aside, nearly knocking her over!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Audrey was about to hurt Leia, a tall, commanding figure stepped in and blocked her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Marcus!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus..." Leia cried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus appear, Leia's emotions overwhelmed her, and she burst into tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the pitiful little girl before him, Marcus felt a wave of tenderness. He picked her up and gently wiped her tears. "Don't cry, Leia. I'm here, no one will bully you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Josie noticed Marcus as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt like she was seeing a mirage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man she had dreamt about countless nights had actually come...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless nights, Josie had woken from her dreams, her mind filled with Marcus's tall and imposing figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There had been times when Josie had an overwhelming urge to go to Solomia to find Marcus, but she had always suppressed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie was a self-aware woman. She had always believed she wasn't good enough for Marcus and had no right to intrude on his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And so, she had endured her pain and longing in silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never imagined that in her most helpless moment, that man would appear!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Marcus's figure seemed larger than life in Josie's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Shelman, are you alright?" Marcus asked gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus stepped forward, helping Josie to her feet and speaking with warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For reasons she couldn't explain, seeing Marcus again brought tears to Josie's eyes. "I'm fine. I'm just... so happy to see you again, Mr. Fitzgerald," she said, her voice trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, look, the secret lover has arrived! Everyone, check it out&mdash;this is Ms. Shelman from BioFusion Pharmaceuticals, the famous businesswoman of Kingston!" Audrey mocked loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Turns out, she's just a slut sneaking around with random men!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
