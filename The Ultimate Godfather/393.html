        <h1>Chapter 392 Bragged</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Several people began to criticize Catherine, looking at her with disdain. Some people even laughed out loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Baily sneered, "Catherine, do you think this joke is funny? To suppress me, you actually bragged. Marcus is the owner of Golden Group? Do you think he looks like that kind of person?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betsy said, "I remember that the head of Golden Group is Michelle Smith. I saw her on the news a few days ago. She is so beautiful, a strong woman. She is a model for women!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone echoed, "I saw it too. Catherine is lying. The person in charge of Golden Group is Michelle Smith. It can be found on the Internet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sheila glanced at everyone, showing a bit of pride on her face, and said, "Speaking of Golden Group, I have to brag about my boyfriend, Scales Bernard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Have you heard that Golden Group recently invested in a pharmaceutical industrial park on Bayside Avenue to build the largest pharmaceutical manufacturing base in Solomia?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"These days, the Pharmaceutical Industrial Park is installing production equipment, and the person in charge of this is Scales!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Upon hearing this, many people exclaimed. A woman said, "Sheila, your boyfriend is really amazing. A big company like Golden Group actually cooperates with him. I'm so envious!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For a while, many people flattered Sheila and Scales and looked at them with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sheila really enjoyed the feeling of being flattered, and she felt very elated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said with pride, "You are right. It is an honor for my boyfriend to cooperate with Golden Group. I believe that after this project, my boyfriend will definitely be well-known in this industry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing so many envious gazes, Scales became arrogant. "Thanks to Ms. Smith's appreciation, I could get this project. I hope I can do better and better in this industry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Scales, a rich, capable, and humble man, many women present became even more envious. They looked at their boyfriends with complaints.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A woman said sarcastically, "Catherine, Sheila's boyfriend is so outstanding. And most importantly, he dares to tell the truth. But you actually bragged. What do you take me for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catherine couldn't help but explain anxiously, "Marcus is really the head of Golden Group. Believe it or not. When I was the sales manager of Cedars Villas, it was Marcus who promoted me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone doubted. "Oh, you used to be the sales manager of Cedars Villas. I never thought of that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Catherine took out her mobile phone, opened the photo album, and found some photos of her time as a sales office manager to show everyone as proof.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A woman laughed, "Catherine, what can these photos prove? Many people would take such photos and show them off on social media. I think yours looks posed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some people said, "Catherine, be realistic. If your boyfriend is jobless, let Scales help him. Your boyfriend looks quite interested in the job at Golden Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betsy pulled on the corner of Catherine's clothes and whispered, "It just so happens that Scales has a cooperation with Golden Group. With Scales' ability, he should be able to help your boyfriend apply for a job there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Scales said sarcastically, "Not anyone is qualified to work in Golden Group. This company is strict. I felt this when I worked for it. People without solid ability can't join Golden Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I help Marcus join it, but he doesn't do a good job and boasts like Catherine, it's too embarrassing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus is suitable for some basic jobs, such as delivering takeout, delivering express, or being an online ride-hailing driver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Being realistic is better than anything else. Don't live in a vain world all day long."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many people thought the same and nodded. They had already believed that Marcus was the kind of jobless and boastful loser.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Baily spoke, "Sheila, my girlfriend doesn't have a job yet. Can you let Scales arrange for her to work at Golden Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His girlfriend had just graduated from college and had little work experience. He had just had a foothold in the City Hall, so he had no way of helping his girlfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing that Scales was so capable, Baily wanted to take this opportunity to help his girlfriend work in Golden Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Baily heard that the working treatment at Golden Group was even better than that of some foreign companies. If his girlfriend could really get a job there, it would be pretty good.</span></p></div>
