  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus soon announced that Rising Logistics Company and Darian Logistics Company would merge, and Darian was the president.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this way, Darian Logistics Company became the largest logistics company in Solomia and even among the surrounding cities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After completing the merger, Darian Logistics Company still adhered to its previous business philosophy. The main focus was on customer experience and relatively favorable transportation costs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It immediately gained recognition and unanimous praise from the market and customers. From then on, the monopoly of Solomia's logistics industry by Rising Logistics Company became history.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William, the director of the Solomia Department of Transportation, was sentenced to 18 years in prison for corruption and bribery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As William's accomplice, Tim knowingly broke the law, and he was guilty of harboring a criminal and was sentenced to three years in prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't care about their </span><span>ending</span><span>s. He was practicing in the room of Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the help of pills, his cultivation finally broke through to the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Seven, and it was only one step away from Ancient Martial Stage Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition, Marcus' magic level had been upgraded to level six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The breakthroughs in both magic and Ancient Martial Art had greatly raised Marcus' strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had practiced in his room for three days. In addition to a breakthrough in his cultivation, he made considerable progress in Heavenly Circle Diagram and Shadow Step, and Timeless Warrior's Grimoire had reached the threshold of level six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three days of training were boring. Marcus went out to relax and called Pearl to give him a massage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this period, with Pearl's care, Marcus' daily life had become more regular than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pearl's massage skills seemed to have improved as well, and it helped Marcus to relax completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps because they had known each other for a long time, Pearl had become more talkative than before. She would occasionally tell Marcus about her hometown and some interesting stories from her childhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was noon, and Diana had already prepared lunch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After having a massage, Marcus felt a lot more relaxed. When he walked out of the room to have lunch, Jane stopped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's up?" Seeing Jane's mysterious look, Marcus became curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, what do you think of Pearl?" Jane asked in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's good, a kind and simple girl, and she is very hardworking," Marcus praised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that all? Don't you think Pearl is pretty and exotic?" Jane smiled meaningfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's true. Just come straight to the point," Marcus said. He was sure that Jane must have other means.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane said, "Maybe you can keep Pearl. She's quite lonely. I have chatted with her several times, and I can tell that she wants to be your woman. So don't let her down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled wryly and said, "I only regard her as my sister."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane pouted, "Honey, others might believe it, but do you think I believe this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked at Jane and asked, "Why don't you believe it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane said, "When we were in Winchester Villa, except for Abigail, Natalia and I became your women. Later, when we came to Bayside Villa, Diana fell in love with you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"'I know that you have many mistresses. It can be said that all the women who know you have a relationship with you. You said you only treat Pearl as your sister. Do you think I will believe it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So just do what you want, and don't let Pearl down. Besides, I really want to serve you together with her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the end of her words, Jane's eyes became lustful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bad girl. What are you thinking about all day? You are so slutty," Marcus smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane chuckled. While Diana was cooking in the kitchen and Pearl was cleaning Marcus' room, Jane knelt in front of Marcus and pulled down his pants. Then, she held his penis and sucked it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gasped and felt as if his body had been electrocuted. His magic almost burst out, and he suppressed it forcefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked around and reminded in a low voice, "Are you so hungry for sex? Someone will see this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane looked up at Marcus, her face full of intoxication. "What are you afraid of? There are three women in the house. Two of them have made love with you, and one wants to be yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Jane continued to suck Marcus' penis, and Marcus soon had a hard-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane said softly, "Honey, I haven't seen you for a few days. Your dick seems to have gotten bigger. I want you."</span></p><div class="pagination">
