        <h1>Chapter 918 My Fiancé Is Here-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie once again felt that intense electric shock sensation, and her delicate body stiffened instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she was about to resist, Marcus forcefully pressed her beneath him, his hands kept caressing her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That made the desire that Gertie had just extinguished ignite once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't know why she had such a strong physical reaction to this lecher and couldn't help but curse herself secretly for being lewd and cheap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, no matter how Gertie tried to suppress the lust in her heart, she couldn't control it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' hands seemed to possess some kind of magic, turning Gertie on immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly submitted to her desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Marcus parted Gertie's beautiful legs and once again thrust himself in her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a "puff" sound, his well-endowed private part filled Gertie again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The instant sense of satisfaction made Gertie let out a high-pitched cry, and her whole body kept trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You pervert! Why are you doing this again? I must kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While moaning in pleasure, Gertie uttered threatening words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus didn't care about what Gertie said. He just started to thrust in and out vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, his movements were even rougher and more brutal than earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Very soon, Gertie reached the top again, and her secret garden was wet all over!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Marcus was fooling around with Gertie, several people suddenly appeared on the top of the seaside mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the lead was a tall and imposing young man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was very handsome, his eyes extremely bright, and he imposed a strong presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprisingly, like Gertie, he was also an expert at Ancient Martial Stage Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, the aura imposed by this young man was even stronger than that of Gertie before she broke through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the fianc&eacute; that Gertie had mentioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His name was Yasser Tucker, and he was the young master of the Tucker family, an ancient martial arts family in Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That family had been hiding deep in the Kinton Mountains, isolated from the world, and rarely set foot in the mundane world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason why Yasser led people to Solomia was to look for his fianc&eacute;e, Gertie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie left the Kinton Mountains half a month ago and had never returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, Yasser tried to contact her but never received a reply from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Worried, Yasser went to the Celestial Arc Order and sought information from Ada.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, by following the remaining aura on Gertie's body, he traced all the way here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser could clearly feel Gertie's aura in this place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how he searched, he couldn't find her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Yasser's face turn slightly dark. He couldn't help but ask an old man with white hair and a beard beside him, "Devon, I can sense Gertie's presence. Why can't we find her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Devon Paxton, Yasser's senior, answered, "I also felt Ms. Leah's aura, and her aura seems to be constantly fluctuating, and it's rhythmic. I think Ms. Leah is very likely to be in trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Devon's words made Yasser's face turn even darker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but shout Gertie's name loudly, "Gertie! Gertie! Where are you? I know you're nearby. Please answer me if you hear me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gertie! Gertie! Say something! I know you're still mad at me, and I'm sorry. I'm here only to apologize to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser shouted sincerely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half a month ago, he and Gertie were in seclusion and cultivation together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Gertie so young and pretty, Yasser couldn't resist the temptation and let his lust get the better of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he tried to force himself upon Gertie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But unexpectedly, Gertie rejected him mercilessly, which made Yasser feel embittered. Gertie was his fianc&eacute;e.</span></p></div>
