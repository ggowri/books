        <h1>Chapter 620 Birthday Party</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathaniel spoke to the blonde girl, "This is Uswad. We just finished the medical seminar and you fainted. Thanks to this gentleman, he saved you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blonde girl looked at Marcus and said gratefully, "Thank you for saving my life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved his hand and said, "It's nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to Nathaniel, he added, "I've only temporarily suppressed her illness. She's not fully recovered yet and needs further hospital examination."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathaniel nodded immediately. "I'll keep that in mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have some things to do, so, goodbye!" Marcus bid farewell to the blonde girl and Nathaniel before turning back to his Aston Martin and driving into the traffic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Marcus left, the blonde girl, helped up by others, said, "Oh, I forgot to ask my lifesaver's name. I should thank him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathaniel took out his phone, took a picture of Marcus' license plate, and said, "I took a picture of his license plate. We'll find a way to reach him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blonde girl nodded satisfactorily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where's Luna?" she scanned the crowd and asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She went to her friend's birthday party with her boyfriend and will be back tonight. By the way, Luna said that today is also her birthday," Nathaniel replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl said, "Luna has been so distracted at work since she got a boyfriend. When we get back to Acoton, I need to help her focus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathaniel nodded, thinking that Luna had neglected their master to spend time with her boyfriend, which was indeed improper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although there was traffic congestion, Marcus, with his excellent driving skills, kept squeezing through the traffic and arrived at the agreed restaurant in half an hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since many people came to Jade's birthday party, they had booked a private room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus entered the private room, it was already full of people, mostly women and all around Jade's age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus arrived, Jade's pretty face immediately lit up with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of something, she blushed slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, you're finally here," Jade said, wrapping her arm around Marcus'. Her eyes were full of love for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The traffic jam. Sorry for keeping you waiting," Marcus smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, something besides the traffic jam also delayed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jade, who's this? Introduce us!" A sweet-looking girl asked Jade with curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade scanned the crowd and smiled sweetly, saying, "Let me introduce. This is my boyfriend, Marcus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although everyone had a certain expectation, they were still surprised when Jade officially announced it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, in their impression, this was Jade's first public boyfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In college, she was very conservative, never contacted </span><span>boys</span><span>, and never dated anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Jade had found a boyfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This immediately frustrated two boys who had a crush on Jade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jade, what does your boyfriend do? How did he win your heart? It's really not easy!" a girl asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their memory, even their class leader Albert had pursued Jade for two years without success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert was not only handsome and did well in school, but he was also a native of Solariae with a solid family background. Many girls had a crush on Albert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even the excellent Albert couldn't make Jade agree to date him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't disclose his specific job, but since everyone is in the medical industry, you should know that my boyfriend Marcus' medical skills are so admired by the director of Solomia Hospital," Jade said proudly, feeling proud of Marcus from the bottom of her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's so young. Is he really that good?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many were skeptical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked about the same age as them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Doctors of this age were usually in the stage of accumulating experience and rarely could handle things independently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But according to Jade, Marcus' medical skills had reached a level that even impressed the director of Solomia Hospital. Many couldn't help but doubt it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course. Why should I lie to you?" Jade smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many classmates still didn't believe it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the door of the private room was knocked on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please come in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After getting permission from the people inside, Albert and Luna walked in, making Jade slightly stunned.</span></p></div>
