  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus did not know what Grace was thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He began to channel his cultivation manuals, quickly summoning the Fire Attribute Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a ball of fire appeared in his palm, about the size of a fist, floating there and radiating an intense, scorching glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace's eyes widened in disbelief as she watched this incredible sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this magic? Mr. Fitzgerald, you can use magic? This is unbelievable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace had only seen such things in TV shows and novels before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "I never imagine I would actually meet someone who could use magic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to learn?" Marcus asked, gathering the fire back into his palm with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace eagerly nodded, her eyes filled with admiration. "I do! I want to become a master like Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After examining your body, I think you are more suited for practicing Ancient Martial Art. If you reach a certain level, you can also wield Fire Attribute Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But your three main energy channels are blocked. If you want to learn martial arts, you will first need to clear these blockages."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus spoke calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace blinked, looking a little confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, can you help me clear my energy channels? I really want to learn martial arts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus hesitated, looking slightly embarrassed. "Clearing the energy channels is no problem, but it might be uncomfortable for you. You should think it over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace's face lit up with urgency. "I do not need to think it over. I am determined to learn martial arts. I will do whatever it takes, Mr. Fitzgerald!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her determination, Marcus continued to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To clear the energy channels, you will need to be undressed. That means you will have to be completely naked. If you are not okay with that, we can stop here. Honestly, a young woman like you does not really need to learn martial arts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace's face turned bright red upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shyly looked at Marcus, her voice barely above a whisper. "Mr. Fitzgerald, is there no other way? Do I really have to take off all my clothes?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded, "Clothes are an obstacle to the flow of Numinous Energy. If you try to clear your energy channels while wearing clothes, it could hurt you. Even I might get affected."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace bit her lip, thinking for a moment, before a determined look crossed her face. She thought, "I am not taking off my clothes for any other reason. I am doing this to learn martial arts...Yes, that is it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words seemed like self-reassurance, but it was clear she was resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, can we start now?" Grace asked, biting her lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can," Marcus said with a calm nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though she had made up her mind, Grace still felt a bit embarrassed when it came time to undress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face flushed bright red as she hurried into the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moment later, she emerged, wrapped in a bath towel, her face shy and hesitant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lowered her head, her cheeks flushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her beautiful legs were perfectly shaped and fair, and despite the towel, her curves were still subtly noticeable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I am going to take the towel off now. I am not very attractive, so I hope I do not scare you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Grace let go of the towel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The towel slipped from her body, revealing a stunning scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace was about 5.4 feet tall and weighed around 99 pounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had a thin frame, but her figure was perfectly proportioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her skin was pale, glowing softly in the room's light, almost like a piece of art.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her flat stomach and slim waist formed a perfect curve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike most women, her lower body had sparse hair, and it was a light brown color, making it easy to see the delicate skin underneath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her legs were perfectly shaped, and everything about her body was harmonious and balanced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though her beauty was not immediately striking like Diana and Maxine, Grace's features were well-balanced, giving her an innate, natural charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, why are you not helping me clear my energy channels? Am I ugly? Did I scare you...?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could feel Marcus' gaze, but she did not dare look him in the eye, her voice barely audible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, you are beautiful. I was just observing the blockages in your energy channels," Marcus reassured her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked over to her, placing his hands on Grace's shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment their bodies touched, Grace trembled involuntarily, her body stiffening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought Marcus might do something inappropriate, but to her surprise, he simply guided her to sit on the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Marcus sat across from Grace and began to perform Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.</span></p><div class="pagination">
