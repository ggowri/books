  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Upon hearing this, Jerry's eyes immediately lit up. He had, of course, heard of the Death Syndicate, but someone of his status had never been in direct contact with the higher-ups, let alone the syndicate's leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His uncle, however, was a different story&mdash;one phone call and he had managed to bring the Death Syndicate's top boss into play.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jerry's gaze shifted back to Marcus, and his demeanor shifted to one of outright arrogance. "Kid, you've heard of the Death Syndicate, right? You've crossed the line with me, and when those guys get here, I'll make sure you pay the price for it. And it won't be pretty."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian, Ramona, and Kiera immediately went pale, their faces hardening in concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though they couldn't understand why the police had backed off earlier, if the Death Syndicate really was coming, things were about to take a turn for the worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was simple that the Death Syndicate, formerly known as the Shadow Syndicate, had been one of Solomia's most notorious underground powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These were men who killed without hesitation, ruthless and fearless. If they showed up, Marcus would be finished&mdash;no doubt about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian, looking increasingly concerned, stepped forward, seemingly ready to urge Marcus to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus simply waved him off. "Death Syndicate, huh? It's been a while since I've checked in on them. I'm curious to see how they've been doing. Today seems like the perfect time to catch up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus spoke with no trace of bravado.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though the Death Syndicate had long since fallen under his control, he had largely been focused on the Serpent's Coil organization and had somewhat neglected the Death Syndicate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He recalled Orion Webb&mdash;he had been there when Marcus had single-handedly killed the leader of the Shadow Syndicate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At Marcus' words, everyone in the group froze. Director Rollins, Jerry, Darian, Ramona, and Kiera exchanged confused glances. They couldn't make sense of what Marcus was implying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this guy for real?" Jerry scoffed, laughing derisively. "The Death Syndicate's under his control? That's laughable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rollins joined in the mocking laughter, though he remained silent, likely biding his time until Orion arrived. That was when Marcus would truly learn his place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A few moments later, the sound of luxury vehicles approaching cut through the tension in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Death Syndicate had arrived. Orion, flanked by his loyal followers, stepped out of one of the cars. He was exuding confidence, a man accustomed to power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Director Rollins, it's been a while," Orion greeted with an amiable smile, his tone cordial but carrying an undeniable edge of authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Indeed, it's been a couple of months. And now, I seem to need your help again, Mr. Webb," Rollins replied with a tight smile, clearly eager for what was to come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Orion's eyes flickered with sharpness as he scanned the area. "Who hurt Director Rollins' nephew? I'm curious to see who's brave enough to make such a move."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jerry immediately pointed a trembling finger at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's him, that bastard over there! Mr. Webb, please, don't hold back&mdash;cripple him! I want him to suffer for what he did!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mr. Webb's gaze fell on Marcus, and for a brief moment, he seemed to hesitate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes narrowed as he took a closer look. And then, recognition struck. "Mr. Fitzgerald..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His voice faltered slightly, a tremor of fear creeping in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The memory of the day Marcus had single-handedly killed the leader of the Shadow Syndicate came rushing back&mdash;one swift strike, a moment that had haunted him ever since. It was a scene that still chilled him to his core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jerry, oblivious to Orion's change in demeanor, impatiently urged him, "Mr. Webb, what are you waiting for? Finish him off already!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But just as Jerry finished speaking, a resounding slap echoed through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Orion's hand connected with Jerry's face, sending him crashing to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The slap was so forceful that it left Jerry howling in pain, his already battered face now bearing a fresh, crimson mark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You really want to talk? You've got the nerve to insult Mr. Fitzgerald? No wonder you got yourself into this mess," Orion snarled. "If you speak again, I'll cut your tongue out and feed it to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words were harsh, his anger unmistakable&mdash;but beneath it all, there was a palpable sense of fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What had started as a simple job for Rollins had quickly spiraled into a nightmare for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He never expected to find himself caught in the crossfire between Rollins and Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Marcus came after him for this, he'd never be able to escape the consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For a moment, the entire group stood in stunned silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one had expected Orion, the usually polite and composed leader of the Death Syndicate, to suddenly turn on Jerry like this. They were all too stunned to move, unsure of what had just transpired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rollins, equally stunned, finally spoke up. "Mr. Webb, what's going on here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mr. Webb shot him a cold glance, a mocking smile playing on his lips. "You've got a serious problem, Rollins. You want me to take out Mr. Fitzgerald? You may run the city office, but you've clearly lost your mind if you think I'll take orders from someone like you. How dare you even think about crossing him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Turning to face Marcus, Mr. Webb bowed deeply, as did the rest of his syndicate members, their faces etched with deep respect. They weren't just bowing to the man&mdash;they were acknowledging the power that he wielded, a power that Rollins, for all his influence, could never hope to match.</span></p><div class="pagination">
