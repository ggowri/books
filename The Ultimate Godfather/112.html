  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the words left his mouth, Noah gestured to the men behind him. They immediately understood and moved to attack Marcus together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before they could make a move, Marcus threw a punch that landed squarely on Noah's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to dodge, Noah flew backward, landing hard on the ground. Two front teeth were knocked out, and blood gushed from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard! How dare you hit me! I'm going to make you pay!" Noah shouted angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah scrambled to his feet, trying to use his height advantage to overpower Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus responded with a powerful kick to Noah's stomach, sending him flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah let out a scream as he hit the ground, rolling in pain and groaning loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd stood frozen in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one expected Marcus to strike Noah so decisively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Josie looked surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus really didn't play by the rules!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think someone like you can take me on?" Marcus said, brushing off the dust on his clothes and glaring at Noah with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, this outsider is too arrogant! You have to kill him!" Audrey yelled, her face full of rage at seeing her husband attacked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah glared at his men and roared, "What are you waiting for? Kill him already!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His subordinates immediately obeyed and surrounded Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they were no match for Marcus. In less than a minute, he had taken them all down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was stunned. They couldn't believe this young man was so overpowering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There weren't many in Kingston who could humiliate Noah like this, but Marcus was one of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dealing with those fools, Marcus strode over to Noah and hauled him off the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me warn you, don't even think about crossing me! I'm one of the Godfather's men. If you don't want to die, let go right now!" Noah shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus ignored him and shattered both of Noah's knees with a swift kick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah let out a series of agonized screams, his legs giving out as he collapsed in front of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers were shaken to their core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one expected Marcus to be this ruthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after Noah revealed he was one of the Godfather's men, Marcus still acted. His arrogance was shocking!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn you! You dared to touch one of the Godfather's men? Just wait, you won't live through today!" Noah hissed through gritted teeth, his face pale from the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Audrey panicked and rushed forward to support her husband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, call the preachers right now! They'll handle this outsider! He can't be allowed to get away with this!" she cried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing the situation, Noah quickly pulled out his phone and made a call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up, he snarled at Marcus, "If you have the guts, wait right here and face the Godfather's wrath!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing how serious the situation had become, Josie couldn't help but warn Marcus. "Marcus, Noah really does have ties to the Godfather. We should leave before the preachers arrive. I'm worried it'll end badly for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus just smiled indifferently. "Let them come. I'll wait right here. Let's see what they can do to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie trusted Marcus, but she had heard plenty about the Godfather's reputation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the most powerful man in the world, and even an unknown subordinate like Noah could act unchecked in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus attacking one of the Godfather's men was undoubtedly dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're dead, outsider! The preachers will be here in five minutes, and I'll make sure you're tortured to death!" Audrey hissed, practically seething with hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Audrey's words dripped with venom, and it was clear she wanted Marcus skinned alive right then and there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five minutes later, a convoy of vehicles pulled up, and several men stepped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint magical aura surrounded these men, leaving no doubt that they were Wizards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had another identity as well&mdash;they were Western Missionaries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Western Missionaries operated worldwide, with branches in every major city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah was the head of the Kingston branch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His role was purely administrative, and he held no real authority over the Missionaries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only reason the Missionaries heeded his orders was to protect their reputation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honorable Missionary, this man has openly challenged the Godfather's authority. He must face the harshest punishment!" Noah said venomously, the pain in his knees fueling his hatred for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Missionaries turned their gaze to Marcus, and one of them spoke in halting Uswadian. "You've defied the Godfather's authority. You must die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the Missionaries moved as one, surrounding Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie's heart raced with fear, lodged in her throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was nothing she could do. All she could do was watch as Marcus faced a seemingly inescapable fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before the Missionaries could make their move, the lead Missionary's phone began to ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly answered, and Diana's voice came through the line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Honorable Ms. Harrison, how can I assist you?" he asked respectfully.</span></p><div class="pagination">
