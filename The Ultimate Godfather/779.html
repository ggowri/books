  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, since you're already here, come in," Marcus said, pulling his thoughts back to the present and looking at Ada.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada frowned and shot him an annoyed glare. "Why do I feel like you're not exactly thrilled about this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sighed, feeling a twinge of helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Women," he thought, "are truly a puzzle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not too long ago, when he'd forced himself on Ada, she'd regarded him as a mortal enemy, vowing to tear him apart piece by piece.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, after his exhausting return from the space-time gate, all he wanted was a good night's sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moment's hesitation on his part, and she was offended again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, "She didn't even want to be near me before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So why is she upset now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I asked you a question. Are you willing or not? If not, I'll just find some random place outside to spend the night," Ada said, her voice crisp with irritation as Marcus remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never said I wasn't willing. Just come in," Marcus replied hastily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Ada could be quite stubborn at times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he didn't appear welcoming enough, she really might go off to sleep elsewhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And no matter what, she was his woman. There was no way he'd let her spend the night outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing his response, Ada finally stepped inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But once she was in, she simply stood there, unmoving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you here to sleep? Why not get on the bed?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't trying to take advantage of her. He was genuinely curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, sleeping usually involved getting into bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada gave him another sharp glare. "Turn around. I'm going to undress and take a bath. Do you know how filthy I feel after all those fights with those beasts in the space-time tunnel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow and replied casually, "I've already seen everything there is to see. What's left to hide?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada's cheeks flushed crimson. She glared at him again, this time with even more ferocity. "Never bring up such embarrassing things again," she snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she walked straight into the bathroom. Moments later, the sound of running water echoed through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled quietly to himself, thinking </span><span>that</span><span> </span><span>Ada might just have a touch of obsessive cleanliness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if to confirm his suspicions, she spent over an hour in the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time she emerged, Marcus was already on the verge of dozing off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she finally stepped out, she was wrapped in a thick bathrobe, her elegant figure concealed beneath its folds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet despite the modest covering, Marcus' sharp eyes couldn't help but notice her long, graceful legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Freshly washed, Ada looked more radiant than ever, her beauty exuding an air of ethereal charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you planning to stand there all night? Why don't you get on the bed already?" Marcus asked, noticing her hesitance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada glanced around the room and bit her lip. "The people of the Nuer Tribe are unbelievably stingy. They couldn't even arrange a room with a sofa for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It dawned on Marcus then that she'd been hoping he'd offer to sleep on the sofa. He silently cursed her ruthless streak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, there's nothing we can do about that now. Let's just make do with the bed for one night. Tomorrow, we'll both head home. It's not like we're in a position to complain about their hospitality," Marcus said matter-of-factly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada begrudgingly admitted that he had a point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cautiously approached the bed and lay down, keeping her bathrobe on and looking visibly tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus saw it and reached out to the belt of her bathrobe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada's hand shot out to grab him, her expression sharp with alarm. "What are you doing?" she demanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's uncomfortable to sleep in a bathrobe. We've had a long day. You should get some proper rest," Marcus said with a faint smile, gently tugging at the belt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was genuinely trying to help. Anyone would agree that sleeping in a bathrobe wasn't ideal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ada glared at him yet again. "There's no need. I'll make do for one night. Sleeping in a bathrobe is just fine," she said firmly, pushing his hand away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the fact that they'd already been intimate twice, this was the first time they were sharing a bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada couldn't help feeling a little nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her insistence and feeling his own weariness catching up to him, Marcus decided not to press the issue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned over and said, "Alright, do as you like. I'm going to sleep now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And with that, he left her alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada blinked in surprise, her beautiful eyes narrowing slightly. She hadn't expected him to give in so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Doesn't he feel the slightest temptation with someone like me lying next to him?" she wondered, a strange sense of disappointment flickering in her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she quickly brushed the thought aside, reminding herself that she was only here for a place to sleep. There was no point in overthinking things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She told herself to focus on resting. She was just as exhausted as Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After coming to terms with it, Ada settled down, ready to sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, as the silence stretched on, Ada found herself unable to fall asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tossed and turned, her mind spinning with thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could he really be angry with me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or is he just the kind of man who loses interest after getting what he wants?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more she dwelled on it, the harder it became </span><span>to</span><span> quiet her racing thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, after nearly thirty minutes of restless fidgeting, Ada couldn't take it anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She reached out and tapped Marcus lightly on the back. "Hey, are you asleep?" she asked softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus feigned a groggy tone. "I've been asleep for ages. What is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada's cheeks puffed with frustration. "How can you be so dense? There's someone else in your bed, and you're able to fall asleep just like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus rubbed his eyes and replied, "Well, you're not talking to me, and you're not doing anything else either. What else am I supposed to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada caught the implication in his words and immediately felt her blood boil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus turned back over and closed his eyes, letting out a faint snore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This infuriated Ada even more. She gave him a hard shove and said, "Don't sleep! Talk to me for a bit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine," Marcus replied lazily. "What do you want to talk about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada hesitated for a moment, then said, "You gave me a Return Essence Crystal today, but my cultivation is only at Ancient Martial Stage Seven. I still have a long way to go before I can use it. Who knows how many years it'll take."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied casually, "With your current level, it's not hard to advance quickly. The only question is whether you're willing to."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada's eyes lit up with interest. "Do you have a method? I'm willing to try."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at her with a mischievous smirk. "It's the same method we used the last time you broke through. If you're up for it, I can help you reach Stage Eight tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada's cheeks flushed bright red. She glared at him, torn between shame and indignation.</span></p><div class="pagination">
