        <h1>Chapter 970 Moral Coercion-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike Marcus, this guy didn't bother with formalities&mdash;he had zero patience for Morgana's authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morgana's expression darkened, clearly shocked by how brazen and violent these men were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You not only barged into the girls' dormitory, but you also hit a faculty member?" she gritted her teeth. "Do you realize I can call the police on you right now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the thugs snorted, crossing his arms. "Call the cops?" he laughed. "Do you even know who you're talking to?" He jabbed a thumb at the man standing in the center of the group. "This is Sebastien Faust, son of the CEO of Faust Properties. And guess what? His uncle is the chief of police for this entire district. Go ahead. Call the cops. Let's see if they dare to touch us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morgana's face twisted with anger, but hesitation flashed in her eyes. Marcus, meanwhile, watched silently&mdash;unmoved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morgana noticed his lack of reaction, and she suddenly turned to him. "You're just standing there?" she snapped. "As Nicole's older brother, you should have a strong sense of justice! How can you just stand by and do nothing? What kind of example are you setting for your sister?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seriously?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This woman had spent the last ten minutes treating him like a criminal for stepping into the dorm. Now, suddenly, she expected him to step in and help?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was classic moral coercion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Marcus smirked and said, "Weren't you just scolding me for entering the girls' dorm? Now you want me to help?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morgana's face flushed red, and she suddenly felt like the other side of her face was burning just as much as the one that got slapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, one of the thugs suddenly locked eyes with Nicole. "Sebastien," he said, nudging the man in the middle. "Isn't she the girl from last night? Gotta admit, she's damn fine. Still got that pure, youthful vibe. If you take her home tonight, I bet she'd be a real treat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes gleamed with lust as he openly ogled Nicole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the other men smirked and added, "Yeah, Sebastien, this chick is way too hot to pass up. Looks like this trip was worth it after all. Once you've had your fun, let the rest of us have a turn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastien's eyes roamed over Nicole, and a twisted smirk spread across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was young, but already fully developed, her delicate features radiating innocence, and her figure borderline perfect&mdash;the kind that made his lust surge uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn," he chuckled. "She's even better than I thought. Too bad she got away from us last night at the KTV. But no big deal&mdash;we've got her now. Take her back to my place. I'll have my fun first. Then you guys can have what's left."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment those words left his mouth, the thugs lit up with excitement, their eyes filled with depraved hunger. Like predators closing in on their prey, they rushed straight toward Nicole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole's face turned pale, her youthful features taut with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! You can't do this!" Morgana shouted, stepping forward without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She threw herself in front of Nicole, using her own body as a shield. "Nicole is my student! I won't let you lay a hand on her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men finally took a closer look at Morgana&mdash;specifically, their eyes fixating on her chest. One of them let out a low whistle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn, Sebastien," he snickered. "This one's not bad either. She's got a more mature vibe, and she's a university professor. Imagine taking both of them at the same time. That'd be one hell of a fucking experience."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastien's tongue flicked over his lips, his interest piqued. "You know what?" he mused. "You're right. Let's take her too. It's been way too long since I had a good threesome."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Sebastien's approval, the thugs lunged forward, their eyes gleaming with sick anticipation. Like starving wolves, they charged at Morgana and Nicole, ready to drag them away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morgana, however, stood her ground, completely disregarding her own safety. She clutched Nicole tightly, her voice firm and unwavering. "Nicole, run!" Morgana yelled. "Go with your brother&mdash;I'll call the police!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the men let out a harsh laugh, his expression turning sinister. "Call the cops?" he sneered. "You dumb bitch. I already told you&mdash;Sebastien's uncle is the chief of police. You think the cops are gonna do shit? You must be out of your fucking mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, his hand shot out, aiming to grab Morgana's collar&mdash;ready to rip her shirt open.</span></p></div>
