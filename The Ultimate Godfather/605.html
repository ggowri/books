        <h1>Chapter 604 Too Pretty to Kill</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The palm strike was incredibly powerful, fully displaying Colby's Ancient Martial Stage Six peak cultivation. It enveloped the space in front of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada smirked, her eyes filled with scorn. She watched Marcus as if he were a joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lad, this is what you get for killing members of our order. Go to hell!" Colby sneered. He infused his Hand Strike with destructive force, aiming to obliterate Marcus in one blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that all you've got?" Marcus replied casually, barely phased by the attack. With a casual flick of his wrist, he unleashed a powerful fist strike that collided head-on with the man's palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thunderous explosion echoed through the air as the two forces clashed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Colby had expected Marcus to be overwhelmed, but as the battle progressed, a look of horror crept across his face. An unstoppable force was pushing back his attack, shattering his Hand Strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' fist strike continued unabated, slamming directly into Colby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a deafening roar, Colby was sent flying like a cannonball, crashing into a nearby tree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tree splintered and collapsed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Colby spat out mouthfuls of blood, his eyes wide with disbelief. "You... you're an Ancient Martial Stage Seven expert..." he gasped before succumbing to his injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada was dumbfounded. She had never imagined that Marcus was so powerful. An Ancient Martial Stage Seven expert was on par with their order leader, Millet. Even at the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Six, she was no match for such a formidable opponent. With Colby slain, she knew she had to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus didn't give her a chance. He activated his Heavenly Circle Diagram, and countless Runes erupted from his body, enveloping the area in a powerful formation. Ada was trapped within and unable to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't you say you'd kill me if I didn't join your order?" Marcus sneered, his gaze fixed on her. "Well, now's your chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada's expression turned sour as she realized how arrogant she'd been. As Marcus approached, she grew wary. "What are you going to do? Don't kill me, or Mr. Spacey won't let you go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sneered, "Don't worry, you're too pretty to kill. I couldn't bear to."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada seemed to understand what Marcus meant. She narrowed her eyes. "What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' smile grew more sinister. With a flick of his wrist, he activated a rune within the formation, completely isolating the area. They were now cut off from the outside world. "You'll see," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada's face turned ashen as she looked into Marcus' greedy eyes. She knew exactly what was coming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a woman of virtue, Ada would never submit. Seizing an opportunity, she tried to launch an attack to regain the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus had anticipated her move. He grabbed her wrist swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go of me!" Ada cried. Her face was grim. She struggled to break free, but his grip was firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a gentle tug, Marcus pulled Ada into his embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me go, you pervert!" Ada shouted, her face flushed with embarrassment. She had never imagined that she would find herself in such a predicament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada had planned to kill Marcus. There was no way he would let her go. He slid his hand up her body and cupped her breast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada let out a muffled cry. Like Diana, she had lived through an entire lifetime before, yet she had never been intimate with a man. The sensation of his touch sent shivers down her spine, and her mind went blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift rip, Marcus tore her white gown.</span></p></div>
