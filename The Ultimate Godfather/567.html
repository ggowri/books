  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The high-ranking members of the Axe Gang were struck with sheer terror, a suffocating pressure washing over them in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, Derek's massive hand gripped tightly, ready to claim his opponent's life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoosh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, a beam of destructive light shot down from the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek's instincts screamed in warning, the threat approaching fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swiftly tossed the Axe Gang member aside, his body darting to the side just in time to avoid the annihilating beam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone turned their gaze toward the direction of the blast, eyes widening as they saw Marcus walking slowly toward them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, you've finally arrived..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake and Baron couldn't hide their relief, their faces lighting up with a mix of hope and awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus&mdash;he was their last hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcus couldn't handle Derek, it would mean the end for the Axe Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded at Blake and Baron before turning his gaze to Luther and Derek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who gave you the courage to kill my subordinate?" he asked coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luther froze for a second before sneering. "What are you? A nobody daring to act all high and mighty in front of an elder of the Celestial Arc Order? You must be asking for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes narrowed slightly, and he turned to Luther, his voice calm but dangerous. "Did you say he's from the Celestial Arc Order?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luther's face took on a smug, arrogant expression. "That's right. This is Derek, an elder of the Celestial Arc Order. He could wipe the floor with scum like you. I suggest you kneel and beg for mercy, or maybe he'll spare you, seeing as you have some strength. But don't get your hopes up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Luther could finish his taunt, the air cracked with the sound of thunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a blink, a bolt of lightning descended from the sky, striking him down without mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luther didn't even have time to scream before the bolt exploded on impact, his body disintegrating in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flesh and bone shattered, raining down in pieces, and the stench of blood filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd froze, their hearts pounding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one expected Marcus to strike so decisively, especially when they had just learned that Luther was standing next to a Celestial Arc Order elder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet Marcus had killed him without hesitation. The speed and power of that lightning were terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Luther was just an ordinary person, the fact that he was backed by Derek didn't matter. He was obliterated without a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake and Baron's expressions shifted, a flicker of hope igniting within them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given the power Marcus had just displayed, maybe he really could stand toe to toe with Derek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek's cold eyes swept over Marcus, his voice dripping with disdain. "So, you're a Level 5 Wizard? Well then, I guess I'll finally see what all the fuss is about."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had mistaken Marcus for a Level 5 Wizard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't bother to correct him. He simply watched as Derek took a step forward, the full force of his Ancient Martial Art power unleashing with a deafening roar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The aura of a Stage Five Master flooded the area, and in the blink of an eye, a crushing palm strike was launched toward Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The palm carried with it an overwhelming, almost impossible force&mdash;a deadly blend of martial arts and mystical techniques. In a heartbeat, the space in front of Marcus was completely sealed off, the air vibrating with raw energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This palm strike is insane. Let's see how this guy plans to survive it," muttered one of the Celestial Arc Order's experts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Derek was only at the Stage Five of Ancient Martial Art, he had been entrenched in that realm for years, his strength honed to a razor's edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His experience gave him the power to challenge opponents far beyond his level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking down a young Level 5 Wizard should be a walk in the park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the looks of the palm strike, Derek was clearly planning to end this quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kid, you're so young and already looking for death... What a shame," Derek sneered as he released the devastating attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice dripped with mockery, as if he were certain that this one strike would seal Marcus' fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, didn't flinch. Instead, he let out a cold laugh. "You really think that palm of yours is strong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he threw a single punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air shook violently as the shockwave of destruction spread in all directions, a low, thunderous roar ripping through the sky. The ground trembled beneath them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek's mocking grin quickly faded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment their attacks collided, he felt an irresistible force crash into him, like a sledgehammer slamming into his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next instant, there was an explosive crack, and Derek's body was sent hurtling through the air. Like a bullet, he slammed into a nearby wall, shattering it on impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire structure collapsed into ruins, burying him in a pile of debris.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood poured from his mouth as he lay in the wreckage, his eyes wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How... how is this possible?" he gasped weakly, his voice barely a whisper. "You... you're actually... an Ancient Martial Art Stage Six expert..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those final, incomprehensible words, Derek's body went limp, his life snuffed out in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been so certain that Marcus was just </span><span>an Ancient Martial Art </span><span>at </span><span>Stage Six</span><span>. In the end, he couldn't have been more wrong.</span></p><div class="pagination">
