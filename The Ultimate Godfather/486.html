        <h1>Chapter 485 Power Display</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus stepped forward. With a burst of Shadow Step, he blurred into countless afterimages, moving with lightning speed until he appeared right before Andrew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew's face twisted in shock as he tried to retreat, but it was too late. Marcus was already clamped tightly around his throat with his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus ' grip tightened before the rest of the Cole family members could react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sickening crack echoed through the hall, and Andrew's throat was crushed in an instant. His eyes widened, filled with disbelief and unwillingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments ago, Andrew had arrogantly ordered his subordinates to hunt Marcus down and eliminate him. Yet now, less than five minutes later, he was dead at Marcus' hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Cole!" The other Cole family members froze in terror. Among them, the senior leaders exchanged glances, gazes toward Marcus brimming with cold hostility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the senior members barked an order to the armed guards. Guns were immediately raised, all aimed at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before they could pull the trigger, a deafening crack of thunder descended from above, striking the senior leader who had given the order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The senior leader didn't even have time to scream as the lightning obliterated his body, leaving nothing but ashes behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd gasped, their blood running cold. No one could have imagined Marcus' power was this overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bullets rained down like a storm, shredding the furniture in the hall to splinters. But to Marcus, the projectiles were as sluggish as snails. He weaved effortlessly through them, his movements smooth and unhurried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of his hand, Fire Attribute Power erupted from thin air, engulfing the armed members of the Cole family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In moments, the hall became a raging inferno, the air thick with agonized screams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quick! Call for the family's metahumans!" As the situation spiraled out of control, one of the senior members shouted at those outside the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man immediately obeyed the order. It wasn't long before a dozen figures appeared swiftly in the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These individuals were all metahumans, accompanied by dozens of fourth-generation cyborgs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leading the group were two metahumans who had reached level five, with the others all at levels three or four. Together, they formed a force to be reckoned with. A terrifying display of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill this Uswadian!" the senior leader roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The metahumans and cyborgs turned their cold, murderous gazes toward Marcus, their intent as sharp as daggers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You Uswadian," sneered the level-five metahuman at the front, his tone dripping with arrogance, "I advise you to surrender now. End your life honorably, and we might leave your corpse intact. Refuse, and you'll die in the most miserable way imaginable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others nodded, their confidence unshaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Cole family was among the top-tier clans in Acoton. No one had ever dared storm their stronghold alone, let alone kill their people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, even surrounded by such a formidable force, Marcus remained unfazed. His eyes swept across the crowd. With a steady voice, he declared, "I had no intention of targeting the Cole family, but you insisted on provoking me. You've crossed my line. From today forward, the Cole family will be erased from the face of the Earth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words struck like thunder, echoing in the ears of everyone in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Cole family looked at Marcus dismissively, though Marcus had just demonstrated impressive power and, in an unexpected move, killed their family head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, facing so many metahumans and fourth-generation cyborgs raised by the family, this man showed no fear. In fact, he only seemed to grow bolder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The metahumans and cyborgs exchanged looks, their faces twisting into mocking smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since this Uswadian refuses to see reason," one of the level-five metahumans said coldly, "we won't waste words with him. Let's just kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others nodded. In the blink of an eye, various powers surged from all directions, rushing toward Marcus. The entire space seemed consumed by the forces of destruction, with Marcus at its epicenter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with a swift Shadow Step, Marcus completely ignored the incoming attacks. He vanished and reappeared in front of one of the metahumans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The metahuman's eyes widened in shock. Before he could even release his abilities, Marcus' fist struck with blinding speed. A deafening boom rang out as his head exploded into a mangled mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without pausing, Marcus flicked his finger. A beam of destructive light shot out like a speeding arrow, piercing the forehead of another metahuman in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood poured from the wound, and the metahuman's face twisted in disbelief. He hadn't even had a chance to fight back before being instantly killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than two breaths, two of the Cole family's metahumans had been slain on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining metahumans and cyborgs from the Cole family were left horrified, their eyes wide with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two level-five metahumans seethed with rage.</span></p></div>
