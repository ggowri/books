  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Murder, murder..." Joshua howled in agony. His forehead was covered in wounds, and he felt he had seen heaven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is your last chance: lick my shoes or not?" Marcus asked Joshua with a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he still barked at him, he would continue the violence without the slightest hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this very moment, Joshua seemed to perceive the killing intent of Marcus as well as his brutality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Death would be a very probable end for him if he insisted on going back on his word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Joshua immediately begged Marcus to stop. "Okay, okay! I'll lick your shoes! Just stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing his surrender, Marcus immediately stopped hitting him and said condescendingly, "Hurry up, or I'll start beating you again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, he gripped Joshua's hair as a warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua shook his head in fear and said, "I'll do it right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he lowered his head to lick Marcus' patent leather shoes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment his tongue touched his shoes, Joshua broke down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All his self-esteem as a man had been shattered by Marcus. All he wanted to do now was to disappear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My shoes aren't clean enough," said Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With an ashen face, Joshua had no choice but to lick Marcus' shoes more carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Marcus waved his hand at Joshua and said, "Good. You can go with this good attitude. Anyway, remember to help clean my shoes every time I see you. Otherwise, I can clean my shoes with your blood."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, Joshua violently trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For inexplicable reasons, he knew Marcus was a man of his word just during this short, unpleasant meeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such casual words from Marcus' mouth made Joshua deeply believe that he was totally capable of doing what he had said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the sake of his pitiful self-esteem and his tongue, Joshua decided to stay as far away from this man as he could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The humiliation and blood on Joshua's heart intimidated everyone present, even making their gaze at Marcus utterly change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the arrogant Molly and Hannah were also appalled by this shocking violence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arrogance was the very thing that led to Joshua's tragedy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cooperation with Golden Pharmaceutical Manufacture and his dignity all went in vain due to his recklessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he left was overwhelming humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's more, Marcus did all those inhumane things without any burden or hesitation, which suggested that he should be at the bottom of the list of being offended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Marcus looked at Molly and Hannah and asked, "For all the suspicion and insults you gave me, do you think I deserve Josie now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked at each other and found both of them speechless. Resentment and unwillingness filled their hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Marcus' position in the Golden Group and his philosophy of tit for tat, he still couldn't be compared with Molly's and Hannah's husband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them was the executive vice president of McHale Pharmaceuticals Group in Uswad, while the other worked as the biggest supplier of Eastcomm Group and Sync Group, two burgeoning companies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were both ranked in the top twenty rich people in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the rank didn't seem to be very high, it was stunning enough since they were in the capital of this country.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As far as Molly knew, Jace had more than 10 billion dollars in sum, which was far more than the amount of money in the craziest dream of ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, that was why they still looked down upon Marcus even after he retaliated against Joshua in such a horrible way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Molly said, "We were wrong about you. You're indeed more capable and cruel than we thought. But it doesn't mean you can ever deal with us or our husbands. You're just a piece of shit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus almost shoved Molly to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grudges had already been sown in her heart. That was why she cursed him regardless of her manners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her rudeness, everyone still thought she made sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how miserable he made Joshua, everyone present reached the consensus that Marcus could never bear the consequence of antagonizing Molly's and Hannah's husband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A girl said, "Molly, asking your husband to deal with him will simply crush him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your husband is one of the top twenty rich people in Kingston, and he is nobody," she continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone echoed, "In my view, he did these to Joshua only because he knew some cops who could settle it down for him. Anyway, crushing him will be like crushing an ant for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another person said, "Yeah. Your husband is so wealthy that few of us in our classmate circle can even compare to him. I even want to pray for Marcus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although they seemed to be accusing her, their tone was full of flattery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Molly smiled smugly and said, "It's not bully; it's selection. Josie is my classmate, so her boyfriend must be on the same level as my husband, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's right. She's on the same level as us, so her boyfriend should also be on par with ours. If he can't, it will only prove that she has made a wrong choice," said Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people turned to look at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remained calm as ever and said while looking at Molly, "Your husband is a supplier of Eastcomm Group and Sync Group, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nodding in pride, Molly didn't expect him to say the following outrageous words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about I cancel their cooperation with your husband with a simple phone call? Given that you're Rosie's best friend, I will forgive you if you apologize to me now. If not, you'll see," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After these words were spoken, Hannah, Molly, and other people were all stunned by such words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Marcus made Joshua's business vanish in the blink of an eye, they would never believe he would make what he said come true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Jace's power was in a different dimension from Joshua's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua could earn tens of billions a year at best, while Jace ranked in the top twenty among all those rich people in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had no comparability at all, which meant Marcus could definitely not succeed in dealing with Jace the way he dealt with Joshua.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, after listening to his words, Molly couldn't help but sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said to Marcus, "Are you still in your dream? You don't think that you are qualified to provoke my husband just because you canceled the cooperation with Joshua, do you? If you think so, you are totally wrong. My husband will erase you without even moving his fingers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This statement immediately attracted the approval of many people present since no one believed that Marcus had the ability to rival Molly in any aspect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I assume you will only wake up until I demonstrate it so directly to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied with a composed smile. He wasn't irritated by their doubts at all and intended to let the facts speak for themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, try it. Let me see how far you can go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Molly agreed without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, people around all focused on Marcus, wondering what he was gonna do to combat her.</span></p><div class="pagination">
