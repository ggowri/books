  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Standing next to Xander, the man he had assigned earlier was still by his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Along with them were two other elderly men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They appeared to be in their early fifties, yet their presence exuded an overwhelming energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Both had reached Ancient Martial Art Stage Five, a level of mastery so formidable that, within the entire Uswad Ancient Martial Arts community, such individuals were rare and highly respected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fact that two of them stood together only amplified the strength of Xander's network.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But that wasn't all. Around them were dozens of individuals holding torches, all armed with heavy assault rifles. By rough estimation, there were at least fifty to sixty people, a considerable force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was clear. Xander had set a trap for Marcus, a web so intricately designed that it was only waiting for the prey to step into it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, please, leave now! Don't worry about me. They're using me as bait to lure you in!" came Kiera's frantic voice from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Kiera was tied to a large tree, guarded by two men armed with rifles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Slap!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Kiera could finish her plea, Xander's hand struck her across the face with brutal force. His eyes blazed with fury as he growled, "He had my son killed, wiped out our bloodline. Do you think he's getting away? No, tonight, I'll make him wish he'd never been born. I'll flay his skin, break his bones, and scatter his ashes to the wind!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' gaze locked onto Xander, his pupils narrowing with deadly intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was clear that Xander had crossed a line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Out of respect for War God Oliver, I'll give you one last chance," Marcus' voice was cold, yet carried an undercurrent of raw power. "Release them now, and sever one of your arms. I'll spare your life. Otherwise, not a single person here will leave alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At these words, Xander and his companions froze, momentarily stunned. Then, a mocking grin slowly spread across Xander's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You must be out of your mind, kid. You think you can kill me? Look around. You're surrounded by my best fighters, the most skilled in the world. You won't even make it out of here alive, let alone kill me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Xander was a careful planner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before making his move on Marcus, he had mobilized every ally, every connection he had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd thoroughly investigated Marcus and learned that he, too, was a practitioner of Ancient Martial Arts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was when Xander pulled out all the stops and brought in two elders from the Astral Serpent Order, an organization known for its deadly power, to deal with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With them by his side, Marcus' fate seemed sealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're refusing to take this opportunity, then?" Marcus asked, his voice steady, almost indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Xander's subordinate, the one who had been helping him, sneered. "What, you're going to lecture us now? You're a dead man walking, and you don't even realize it. You're nothing but a clown!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before the man could finish, the air itself seemed to tremble, and then&mdash;a flash of purple lightning split the night sky, slamming down from nowhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bolt was as wide as a bowl, and it struck the man with such force that he was instantly reduced to nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No trace, no ash, just gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A collective gasp swept through the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one had expected Marcus, even under such heavy siege, to have the audacity to strike at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But what truly shook them was the power of the lightning&mdash;so precise and forceful that even the two Astral Serpent Order elders hadn't been able to react in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Attack!" Xander shouted, his face twisted in fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He waved his hand, and his men with heavy weapons immediately opened fire on Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sound of rapid gunfire shattered the night, bullets flying in every direction like a deadly storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus just smirked, an air of calm indifference about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He extended his senses and in an instant, enveloped the area in his awareness, taking full control of the space around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bullets, though fast, moved as though in slow motion in his perception.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He took a casual step forward, easily dodging the oncoming barrage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, he summoned his magical energy, weaving it into a massive firestorm that erupted around him, engulfing everything in its path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The flames spread like a tidal wave, swallowing the gunmen whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their screams rang out, bloodcurdling cries as they were consumed by the inferno. In just a few seconds, a group of fifty men were incinerated, their bodies reduced to ash. The forest itself seemed to groan under the weight of the destruction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Three swift gestures, and the entire forest was set ablaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The screams continued, desperate and pleading, but in moments, all those holding heavy weapons were reduced to smoldering remains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Xander's face drained of color as he watched in horror. He had never anticipated Marcus possessing such power&mdash;power that could lay waste to an entire battalion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A wave of fire surged toward him, and for a brief moment, Xander thought it would be the end of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He would've been burned alive if not for one of the Astral Serpent Order elders stepping in to protect him, blocking the fire with a powerful shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you think we can't defeat him?" Xander asked, his voice trembling slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of the elders gave him a patronizing glance. "Don't be ridiculous. A mere child, like him? One of us alone could destroy him. You should have more faith."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Xander's fear eased just a little. He felt a sense of security wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though the forest burned and chaos reigned, an invisible barrier surrounded him, shielding him from the flames. No matter how wild the fire raged, it couldn't touch him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
