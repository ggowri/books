  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The female salesperson, along with Ronan and Lara, all focused their gaze on Marcus and Natalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronan and Lara raised their eyebrows slightly. Ronan asked the female salesperson, "Who are they?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The female salesperson sneered and said, "They are also clamoring to buy the new Aventador, but I don't think they look like people who can afford this car. They are just taking advantage of the test drive to take pictures and show off. Mr. Wilder, you don't need to pay attention to them. If you check the car and find it satisfactory, I can help you with the paperwork right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronan and Lara's expressions turned contemptuous as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara crossed her arms and sarcastically said, "What hypocrites they are! I know plenty of people who either show off their luxury cars or their mansions. In reality, many of those are fake. Their fancy cars are rented, their mansions are also rented, and they even share them among several people. It's truly disgusting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In reality, before she became famous, she had often rented luxury cars and mansions to entice wealthy men in order to create her persona.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She met several men from relatively good backgrounds through this method.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she used these individuals as stepping stones, gradually gaining the influence she had today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, she found someone like Ronan, a wealthy second-generation. If Ronan could fulfill his promises to her, Lara was ready to marry him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to completely give her body, which had experienced multiple abortions, to Ronan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lara, don't pay attention to these poor losers. They are on a completely different level than us. If you pay attention to them, their bad luck will rub off on you, making you unfortunate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I usually avoid these poor people, so they don't contaminate me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronan looked at Marcus and Natalia with disdain as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wilder, Ms. Stone, let's go. I fear that if we delay, the finance department will close, and you won't be able to get the car today," the female salesperson urged, not wanting to miss the order because of Marcus and Natalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Marcus stepped forward and asked the female salesperson, "We arrived first. If I pay now, doesn't that mean the car should be sold to us first? Isn't business about first come, first served?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The female salesperson, Ronan, and Lara all glanced at Marcus with deep disdain, their contempt growing stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The female salesperson replied, "In theory, yes. But can you take a look in the mirror? Can you afford such a top luxury car? Your entire outfit doesn't even add up to 2,000 bucks. As a person from the lower social class, don't pretend to be rich. It's meaningless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronan sneered, "Kid, I can understand your feelings. You are pretending to be a rich second generation, trying to deceive that girl, right? I've seen such tricks many times. It's truly despicable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Ronan's gaze shifted to Natalia as he said, "Young lady, you look like you're not even 20 yet, still in school, right? Have you really been deceived by this guy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To tell you the truth, a person like him can't afford a luxury car. If you want a luxury car, I can consider serving you. I see you're quite pretty. As long as you spend a night with me, I can't guarantee you an Aventador, but a Hurac&aacute;n should be no problem."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young female salesperson immediately laughed. She realized Ronan was intentionally mocking Marcus and Natalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara, somewhat disgusted, said, "Mr. Wilder, female college students have very chaotic personal lives. She might sleep with this man today and another tomorrow. If you sleep with her for a night, you might end up with diseases.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you get sick, wouldn't you infect me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronan casually smiled and said, "Lara, I'm just joking. Why do you take it seriously?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's a second-hand. I definitely wouldn't be interested. Don't worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia was very angry. She held Marcus' arm and gently shook it, saying, "Marcus, he is too much. I'm furious!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave Natalia a reassuring look and said, "Don't worry. I will avenge you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Marcus' gaze fell on Ronan as he asked, "Are you the son of the vice president of BioFusion Pharmaceuticals?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronan raised his eyebrows slightly and replied, "Oh, you've heard of me? In that case, stop chatting. You're no match for me, so hurry up and leave. Otherwise, you'll only embarrass yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled and said, "If I'm not mistaken, your dad earns only a little over 10 million Uswadian coins a year. But you squander so lavishly. I'm curious, where does your money come from?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronan proudly said, "Of course, it's earned by my dad. Do you think I stole it or robbed it? Are you envious?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too bad for you. Without a dad like mine, you'll inevitably be poor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronan's face was full of arrogance as he openly stated that his money came from his father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A vice president earning over 10 million Uswadian coins a year was indeed very wealthy compared to an average person, but it doesn't mean his son could casually buy a luxury car worth over 10 million Uswadian coins without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This indicated that the origins of Ronan's father's wealth were not clean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronan felt even more pleased with himself. He pulled out his phone and shook it vigorously in front of Marcus, revealing his balance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The electronic bank card showed a balance of over four billion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you see that? This is just my pocket money. I could even buy this car dealership outright."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronan was extremely proud, reveling in this feeling of superiority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that long string of digits, Lara and the female salesperson couldn't help but cover their mouths, their faces filled with astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "Over four billion Uswadian coins! Such an amount is unimaginable for ordinary people. And Ronan says it's just his pocket money. This indicates that his family's wealth is far beyond this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Lara feel that she had chosen the right person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Ronan is definitely a true rich second generation. Moreover, BioFusion Pharmaceuticals has been developing rapidly lately, with sales hitting new highs. This means that as long as BioFusion Pharmaceuticals continues to thrive, Ronan's father will have endless money. After marrying Ronan, I would become a wealthy lady."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Lara couldn't help but want to laugh out loud. She, a woman who had undergone so many abortions, could still tame a wealthy man like Ronan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Ronan even treated her like a precious treasure, which made her feel immensely proud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After witnessing this, Marcus furrowed his brows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had previously suspected that Kristen Wilder, the vice president of BioFusion Pharmaceuticals, had problems. But Josie believed that Kristen was an elder figure from the early establishment of BioFusion Pharmaceuticals and had made significant contributions, so she unconditionally trusted Kristen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After seeing the balance on Ronan's phone, Marcus finally confirmed his suspicions.</span></p><div class="pagination">
