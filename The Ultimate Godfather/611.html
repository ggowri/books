        <h1>Chapter 610 Harder!</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' hand boldly cupped Pearl's butt. Her derriere was incredibly firm and shapely. When she had massaged Marcus before, sitting on him, Marcus had felt its allure, leaving him both distracted and captivated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had hesitated to touch her, but now, holding Pearl in his arms, he truly appreciated her body. With a gentle squeeze, a low moan escaped Pearl's lips. Her once youthful face now bore a hint of desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus kneaded, his fingers ventured into Pearl's intimate crevice, encountering a sensation of wetness and smoothness. Her delicate body shuddered, and a powerful current spread throughout, causing her body to shudder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus reached for the sensitive spot. That was where a woman's joy lay. Just the slightest touch and Pearl instantly reached its pinnacle. A sharp, high-pitched cry escaped her lips, her mind going blank. Her bronzed skin flushed with heat, and delicate beads of sweat began to surface, releasing a subtle, intoxicating scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus squeezed that perky, firm peak. It was equally tight and so large that Marcus couldn't even grasp it fully. He leaned over and began to lick the sensitive spot frantically. Pearl couldn't help but let out a low moan, her entire expression turning to one of pure enjoyment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Pearl quickly knelt in front of Marcus, pulling down his pants and taking hold of his already firm and sizable member, her mouth following suit. Though her movements were </span><span>rusty</span><span>, just gazing at Pearl's exotic, striking face hit Marcus like a punch, delivering a powerful visual jolt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus thought, "I knew it must have been that slutty Jane who taught Pearl. Otherwise, how could Pearl, a pure girl, know such things?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while of pleasure, Marcus' desire reached its peak. He lifted Pearl's delicate body and placed her on the bed, spreading her legs apart and gazing at the already wet, mysterious area. Slowly, he entered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pearl cried out in pain, the sensation almost making her lose consciousness. It was inevitable&mdash;the first time for a woman was always a mix of pain and pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had tried his best to be gentle with his movements. After a while of friction, the pain gradually faded, replaced by a powerful sense of relief. As Marcus' Dual Cultivation energy surged, that feeling of comfort intensified, making Pearl sink into endless pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a sensation far more intense than anything she'd ever experienced on her own. With every thrust, Marcus stimulated Pearl's most sensitive nerves, causing her to cry out wildly as her body involuntarily tightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pearl thought, "Jane didn't lie to me&mdash;being with a man is nothing like comforting myself on my own." The sensation was so overwhelming that Pearl's mind went blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus thrust with increasing power, Pearl could feel her peak approaching again. Unable to hold back, she gasped, "Mr. Fitzgerald, harder! Faster! I'm almost there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus instantly understood, increasing both speed and depth with each thrust. This made Pearl almost faint for a moment, but finally, with the impact of a sudden storm, she reached her second peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, it was even more intense than before, causing her body to tremble, and her breathing became more forceful. Her body had already lost all strength, leaving her completely at Marcus' mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And just as the two of them were immersed in endless pleasure, Jane stood quietly at the door, listening intently. After hearing Pearl's exaggerated scream, a relieved smile finally appeared on her face. At the same time, the fiery desire in her heart seemed to be stirred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hands began to caress her own sensitive areas, and the more she touched, the stronger the feeling of emptiness inside her grew. This sensation quickly became unbearable for Jane, who felt an overwhelming need to be filled with something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gathering her courage, Jane opened the door and was met with the sight of the bed, where a scene of intense passion was unfolding. Without hesitation, she removed her nightgown, revealing her flawless figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was suddenly jolted awake by the sound. He turned instinctively and saw Jane, who was naked, standing there. Before he could even react, Jane had already walked over to the bed and leaned down to kiss his nipple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rush of sensation nearly made Marcus lose control. He fought to keep himself composed, giving Jane a sharp look before asking, "What do you think you're doing? Are you out of your mind? Don't you have any shame?"</span></p></div>
