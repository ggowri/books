  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sneered and released the Wood Elemental Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Endless vines grew out of his body and quickly enveloped Johnson's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnson was horrified and used his magic power to try to break free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the vine was tough, and it kept getting tighter and tighter, making Johnson impossible to break free in a short period.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Marcus took a step forward to stand in front of Johnson and punched him in the chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnson's blood spurted out, and he begged for mercy from Marcus, "Young man, as long as you are willing to spare my life, I will agree to anything you ask for."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled sarcastically, "Sorry. I don't need your request."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he finished speaking, his iron-like fist hit Johnson's head directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a bang, Johnson's head exploded, leaving him a headless corpse and falling straight down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus quickly collected Johnson's Spatial Ring and walked to Natalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because the previous gunfight had been too intense, Natalia was frightened to the point of fainting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Natalia did not witness the battle between Marcus and Johnson and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A stream of Numinous Energy poured into Natalia's body, and she woke up then. "Marcus, am I dead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled, "You are still alive. Don't say such depressing words."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, did you save me?" Natalia was dizzy, vaguely remembering the scene where Marcus had killed the enemy valiantly with the M16.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't have that ability. The Uswad Special Forces saved us," Marcus said something similar to what he had said to Richard before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought that Natalia and the others should not know those things beyond ordinary people's cognition too early.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So that's how it is. But if it weren't for you, Marcus, I wouldn't be able to survive. So, I'm only grateful to you, Marcus," smiled Natalia slightly and looked extremely weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus hurriedly opened the iron lock and sent Natalia out of the courtyard. Then, he set the manor on fire and turned away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a secret room in the Brown Manor in Kingston, Ricardo, the head of the Brown family in Kingston, was sitting cross-legged, practicing some secret technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a sharp alarm rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricardo suddenly opened his eyes and saw a raging fire in a suburban manor on the surveillance camera.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said angrily, "Who did it? How dare he destroy the Brown Manor? Investigate it immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone immediately took the order and launched an investigation into the matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricardo turned on the surveillance playback and saw Marcus appear in it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Leo's neck being broken, he felt a strong aura of hatred burst out from his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leo, my son, I will never let your death be in vain," roared Ricardo loudly, the anger and sadness in his heart reaching the extreme.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Brown family in Kingston was not as simple as it seemed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition to possessing wealth that rivaled that of a country, Ricardo was also a warrior at the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Three and had close ties with the Weston Magic Guild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricardo had been active in the business, political, and Ancient Martial Arts circles of Uswad for many years. He'd been through all sorts of things, but no one had ever done that to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Once I find out the identity of the person who killed my son, I will cut him into pieces to pay tribute to my son."</span></p><div class="pagination">
