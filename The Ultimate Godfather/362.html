        <h1>Chapter 361 Easily Defeated</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace had no idea that Marcus possessed extraordinary abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "These Crankhurstians are utterly shameless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their side claims to be 9th-dan black belt champions in Karate, yet they want to challenge the Uswad side in martial arts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is completely unfair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If we do not accept the challenge, these Crankhurstians will definitely mock us mercilessly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mitchell, are you saying that Mr. Fitzgerald is afraid?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terry raised an eyebrow, pausing before continuing, "If Mr. Fitzgerald is afraid, then he should apologize for wasting our time earlier!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the apology satisfies us, we can call off this match."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These words made Grace even angrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald does not even know you, why should he apologize? Do you Crankhurstians not understand reason?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zane responded, "Reason is built on strength. Those without strength do not deserve to speak of it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the right moment, Easton stood up and fixed his gaze on Marcus. "Mr. Fitzgerald, do not worry. We are only sparring. I will try not to hurt you. We Crankhurstian are always reasonable. I hope you make the right choice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace gritted her teeth in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus waved to her, glanced at Zane and Easton, and said with a smile. "My Uswadic Martial Arts never fight the weak, but since you want to spar, I will indulge you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he stood up from his seat, walked to the center of the living room, and beckoned to Easton.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Easton frowned. He had not expected Marcus to be so fearless. "The space here is too small. Mayor Benjamin, please arrange for a proper combat ring so I can show my skills."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin was about to speak, but Marcus interrupted, "To fight you, there is no need for a ring. We can do it right here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The faces of the Griffin family turned dark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlotte sneered at Marcus. "Easton is a 9th-dan black belt champion in Karate. You will regret this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish, Easton stood up angrily and walked toward Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved his hand at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Easton smirked. "Are you backing out? If so, apologize to our Griffin family right now. Kneel and bow your head, and I might forgive you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sneered, "You misunderstood me. You alone are not enough. Bring your Uncle Zane too. I think he is also a martial artist."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This statement shocked everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one expected Marcus to challenge two people at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace's eyes widened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though she was worried for Marcus, she had to admit that his fearless demeanor was undeniably impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure you want to take on two people?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zane asked, his brow furrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I do not want to repeat myself, and I am not wasting time with people like you. Come at me now. If I cannot take both of you down in three seconds, I will admit defeat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' words were full of provocation, completely enraging Zane and Easton.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They rushed toward him. Easton took the first strike, launching a powerful punch at Marcus. The punch was not only strong but also tricky in angle. With its suddenness, a normal person would have difficulty dodging it and would likely be knocked down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus simply sidestepped and swiftly dodged the punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, he struck Easton's neck with his arm. A loud thud echoed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Easton screamed in pain and collapsed to the ground, writhing in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just one move, he was completely incapacitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zane yelled and performed a spinning kick toward Marcus. Marcus did not even bother to dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the kick came toward him, he landed a punch on Zane's thigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another dull thud sounded. Zane screamed and fell to the ground, knocking him back down as he tried to get up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Easton and Zane had only taken one hit each, but the pain was unbearable. They rolled on the floor in agony, looking utterly helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire process, though it seemed complex, happened in less than two seconds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two 9th-dan black belt Karate masters from Crankhurst were knocked to the ground by Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus only made two moves and quickly defeated Zane and Easton.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers were stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially Terry and Charlotte, who looked on in complete shock.</span></p></div>
