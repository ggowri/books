  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus tried to practice Frostbind and Stormcall, which were found in the Spatial Ring of Wizard before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the previous foundation, it was not as difficult to cultivate other magic for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It only took him two hours to master the essentials of these two kinds of magic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He believed these two kinds of magic could have a certain lethality soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, the first batch of guns has been reformed. Do you want to come back and have a look?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Early in the morning, Marcus received Diana's message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had been looking forward to the transformation of guns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, after receiving this news, he immediately said goodbye to Melina and rushed to Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, when Marcus drove to the Bayside highway, he felt that there were several gods sweeping through the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These gods were so powerful that they enveloped this space and aimed his car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus frowned. They were up no good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You waste my son's training. You can't escape today. Stop the car and prepare to die!" A cold voice sounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seemed to spread in a specific space. For others, this space was still quiet and peaceful and they could hear nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus was the only one who could hear this voice, which made his eardrum slightly numb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A name suddenly came to Marcus' mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The reason was very simple. He had just abolished Truman's cultivation in the Southern Market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Truman was his son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To Marcus' surprise, Asher found him so fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus pulled over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then he dodged into a mountain valley, which was surrounded by towering cliffs. Few people came to this place</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, three voices sounded in the void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then three figures emerged and released a terrifying aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two people on the side who looked about in their forties both reached Ancient Martial Stage Four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The leader in the middle was an old man with a child's face and grey hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He seemed to be over sixty, but he was full of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was the leader of the Astral Serpent Order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The expert of the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Five!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus couldn't help but gasp when he sensed the cultivation of Asher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Through the practice last night, he had just reached the minor completion stage of Ancient Martial Stage Four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He never expected that he would meet Asher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher was much more powerful than Marcus and he brought two experts with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How could Marcus beat Asher?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Did you waste my son's training?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher's eyes rested on Marcus, and his eyes were full of resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't deny it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even in the face of Asher, Marcus didn't have any fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was a tough man, so no matter what happened, he would never admit defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At a young age, you have no fear in the face of me. I didn't expect you to be a courageous person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, I can't forgive you for what you did to my son, so you must die today!" Asher said with a cold voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were bursts of lines in the palm of his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, an array was formed in the void and covered the space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a strange force, the scene around him changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The seaside highway, as well as the mountain where he was both disappeared and turned into a deserted wilderness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The wilderness was endless, and there was nothing as if he was in hell!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is the Rune of Illusion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus called out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To not affect the mundane world, some experts of Ancient Martial Art used this method to shield the battlefield when fighting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This Rune was similar to the Rune of the Blind in Southern Market, but they were still different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was an important reason why ancient fighters were so mysterious in the eyes of ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Warriors, especially some powerful people who had achieved a certain level of accomplishment, were invisible most of the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sometimes, from the perspective of ordinary people, many scenes were visible to the naked eye, but they were not.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was very likely that something was happening in that area that subverted the cognition of ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What ordinary people could see was less than one ten-thousandth of the universe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was just like this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher led people to try to kill Marcus. Before taking action, he shielded the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in the eyes of ordinary people, it was still the mountain before, and there was no difference.</span></p><div class="pagination">
