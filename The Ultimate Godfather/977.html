  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hank immediately snapped back to reality, his eyes wide with disbelief. He turned to </span><span>Ryker</span><span> and asked, "Commander </span><span>Zeller</span><span>, you can't be telling me that this guy is the Special Military Advisor Mr. Fitzgerald?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before </span><span>Ryker</span><span> could respond, Jareth, standing nearby, couldn't hold back anymore and said, "You're right. This is the one and only Special Military Advisor, Marcus Fitzgerald. Now, do you realize how serious your mistake is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words struck Hank like a thunderclap, and his mind raced in shock. He couldn't believe that the young man standing before him was the legendary Special Military Advisor Marcus Fitzgerald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not just Hank, but everyone in the room was frozen in place, their expressions filled with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's the military advisor? How is that even possible?" Dexter's voice trembled, beads of sweat forming on his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't make sense of it. How could someone with such an important role be a tenant in their building?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was beyond anything they could have imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hank, Helen, Kiera, and Dustin were all equally stunned. None of them had any idea that Marcus held such a prestigious position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially Dustin, who felt a mix of shock and relief. It turned out, he'd made the right choice standing with the right people. Had he sided with Hank, he might have been right there with Dexter, facing arrest by the military!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of that made Dustin shudder involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hank's face fell completely. His eyes widened with disbelief as he stared at Marcus. He knew he had made a fatal mistake&mdash;he'd offended the wrong person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Special Military Advisor's authority was on par with that of a military commander. A person of such rank was far beyond someone like him, a mere City Governer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Hank could say anything, </span><span>Ryker</span><span> issued the order, "Anyone who has previously disrespected Mr. Fitzgerald should be detained and sent to a military tribunal for questioning!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the command, soldiers from the Solace Military Division sprang into action. Some charged into the hallway, while others rappelled down from the roof!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than five minutes, Hank, Dexter, and Helen were bound up and dragged out. The neighbors, still in shock, were also ushered out of the building and into the courtyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We should go outside as well," Marcus said to Kiera, who was still in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiera nodded mechanically as Marcus took her hand, guiding her out of the hallway and into the courtyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Ryker</span><span>, even though you're the commander of the Solace Military Division and outrank me, it seems a bit far-fetched to arrest me just because I offended the Special Military Advisor. Even if I were to be removed as </span><span>the </span><span>City Governer, that decision would have to come from the political authorities, not the military. You have no jurisdiction over this matter!" Hank, bound and struggling, defiantly responded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hank's defiant words hung in the air, but </span><span>Ryker</span><span> remained calm, as if expecting this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Hank finished speaking, </span><span>Ryker</span><span> casually took a file from his secretary and tossed it in front of Hank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hank hesitated, then opened the file and began scanning it. As he read, his expression went blank. His body went cold, and his mind raced with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The file detailed several of Hank's own past violations&mdash;violations he had long since forgotten. The file was meticulous, documenting dates, locations, and even the people involved. It was as if someone had been watching him the entire time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold shiver ran down Hank's spine as his mind spun. For a moment, he felt like the ground was slipping away from beneath him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nearly collapsed right then and there, but two soldiers caught him just in time, propping him up.</span></p><div class="pagination">
