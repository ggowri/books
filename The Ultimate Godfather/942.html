  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's eyes sparkled with curiosity. "What is it?" she asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You'll see when we get there," Marcus replied with a mysterious smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana rolled her eyes playfully. She half-expected Marcus was teasing her, trying to lure her back to his room for fun.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Diana wasn't opposed to the idea. After all, she was head over heels for Marcus, and the memories of their intimate moments always brought a smile to her face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In a way, it warmed her heart that Marcus still desired her and thought about her in that way.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And so, as soon as they returned to Bayside Villa, Diana retreated to her room, took a quick shower, and knocked on Marcus' door.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus answered, wearing a bathrobe, and his eyes immediately fell upon Diana, now clad in a black lace nightgown.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His gaze lingered on her figure, pausing briefly on the delicate skin revealed by the neckline.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, what is it you're talking about?" Diana asked, getting straight to the point, her curiosity piqued by Marcus' earlier tease.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus chuckled, pulling Diana into his arms. His hand reached for her full, rounded breasts, gently caressing them as he said, "Let's take care of business first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, he slipped the black lace nightgown off her shoulders, revealing her ample bosom. Diana's skin was flawless&mdash;smooth and utterly captivating. It was hard to look away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her nipples were pert and rosy, standing at attention. Marcus couldn't resist a playful nip, sending a tremor through Diana's body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald," she said, playfully glaring at him, "why are you so mysterious?" A jolt of electricity spread from her breast, igniting a fire within her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her cheeks flushed, and her blue eyes grew heavy with desire. The rosy hue of her skin made her look even more angelic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Diana's irresistible allure, Marcus could no longer contain himself. He leaned in and captured her lips in a passionate kiss.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His slightest touch sent shivers through her, and her breath quickened with anticipation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Marcus' hand moved lower, he found Diana's long-sought-after secret place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was already wet and slick, contracting rhythmically.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' fingers couldn't resist exploring its depths.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh... um... Mr. Fitzgerald, please," Diana murmured, "I can't take much more."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She watched as Marcus' fingers quickened, a surge of electricity coursing through her body, igniting her desire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A deep emptiness bloomed within her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her body began to sway involuntarily, a moan escaping her lips.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching Diana's seductive expression and hearing her soft moans, Marcus' desire reached its peak. He ripped apart her black lace nightgown, revealing her perfect figure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He pushed Diana onto the bed, covering her body with kisses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His own body pressed against her, his hardness rubbing against her opening, teasing the sensitive nub above.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The area was a treasure trove of nerve endings, the source of all her pleasure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With just a touch, Marcus could send Diana into a world of ecstasy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's desire was evident as her body began to produce copious amounts of lubrication, coating the tip of Marcus' engorged member.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a slight thrust of his hips, he broke through her defenses and plunged into her depths.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instead of lying flat on the bed, Diana propped herself up on her elbows, giving her a clear view of Marcus' forceful entry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though it felt scandalous, the sight was incredibly arousing, sending another wave of excitement through her. Her moans grew louder and more insistent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Marcus continued his rhythmic movements, Diana's body became slick and ready.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A long-forgotten pleasure enveloped them both.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald," Diana asked, a look of disbelief on her face, "do you feel even bigger? Or is it just my imagination?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't just idle chatter; it was a genuine observation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Marcus moved within her, she felt an unprecedented fullness. An expansion spread through her entire being, almost to the point of feeling stretched.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a sensation she hadn't experienced since their very first time together. With each encounter, her body had become more accommodating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fact that she was experiencing this again could only mean one thing: Marcus had grown.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Maybe," Marcus replied with a grin. He'd noticed it himself&mdash;each time he broke through a cultivation level, he seemed to gain more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The increase might have been negligible, but with each successive breakthrough, the effect became more pronounced.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And as his cultivation grew, so did his prowess and their Dual Cultivation power, which was likely the reason for Diana's observation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald," Diana purred, her eyes half-closed with pleasure, "if you keep getting bigger, what if I can't handle it anymore?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus chuckled, "Wouldn't that be even better? If you can't handle it, it just means it's more enjoyable!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, Marcus increased the pace and depth of his thrusts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was instantly overwhelmed by the intense pleasure, finally reaching her first climax.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her body clenched around him, her mind going blank.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A wave of pure bliss washed over her, enveloping her completely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was an ecstasy as powerful as her very first time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Marcus, her eyes were filled with pleasure and a hint of adoration.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh, it feels so good," she moaned. "It feels so good. Mr. Fitzgerald, you're amazing. Push harder... I want all of you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lost in the throes of passion, Diana's body moved instinctively, trying to get closer to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her hips bucked and swayed, seeking the friction between her sensitive spot and his </span><span>flesh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each contact sent shivers of electricity through her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before long, her second peak arrived, even more intense than the first. Diana almost blacked out, her body going limp.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus then rolled onto his stomach, positioning himself behind her. In this position, he continued his passionate assault.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's expressions were a sight to behold, her moans growing louder with each thrust. She covered her mouth with her hand, trying to muffle the sounds, mindful of Jane and Pearl in the next room. The thought of them overhearing her was mortifying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Marcus lifted Diana's hips, bringing her to her knees on the bed. He positioned himself at her entrance once more, their bodies meeting in a perfect fit. The friction was exquisite, each stroke sending her closer to oblivion. She'd lost count of how many times she'd reached her peak.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As their movements intensified, Marcus' desire reached its zenith. He gently lowered Diana onto the bed, spread her long, smooth legs, and plunged into her one last time, beginning his final, passionate assault.</span></p><div class="pagination">
