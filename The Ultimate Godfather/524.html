        <h1>Chapter 523 Ancient Martial Stage Seven</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus continued to siphon Phoenix's Numinous Energy while channeling it through the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire. He worked tirelessly to disperse the energy and prevent it from wreaking havoc on his own body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the relentless onslaught of the Devouring Power, Phoenix's struggles gradually weakened. The light in his eyes dimmed as his expression froze in despair. His skin withered visibly, and his body shriveled into a lifeless husk, leaving behind only a dried corpse devoid of vitality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pushing Phoenix's remains aside, Marcus gasped for breath. Victory had come at a cost. The battle was fraught with peril, and had he not advanced to the peak of Ancient Martial Art Stage Six, he might not have survived Phoenix's ferocious onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After eliminating Phoenix, Marcus did not leave immediately. Instead, he sat cross-legged on the barren ground, entering a meditative state to recover his energy. Over the course of an hour, he meticulously restored his strength and began refining the massive amount of Numinous Energy he had absorbed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The process was painstakingly slow, requiring Marcus to dedicate his full attention. Enveloped in the swirling Timeless Numinous Energy, he remained motionless for hours until the refinement was complete. His cultivation level surged forward, breaking through to Ancient Martial Stage Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus exhaled deeply, and a sense of rejuvenation washed over him. The breakthrough brought about a qualitative leap in his strength, doubling his power compared to his former peak state at Stage Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the realm of Ancient Martial Art, advancements became exponentially more challenging as one ascended. However, each breakthrough provided an equally staggering boost to one's abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brimming with newfound confidence, Marcus rose to his feet. With his current cultivation, he could roam the land of Uswad unchallenged&mdash;unless he crossed paths with the reclusive ancient monsters of legend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaving the desolate mountain behind, Marcus returned to the villa without a sound. It was late into the night, and Melina remained fast asleep. Sliding into bed, he wrapped his arms around her, savoring a rare moment of tranquility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, Melina woke at 8 a.m. Finding Marcus beside her, a blissful smile graced her lips. "Did you sleep well?" she asked softly, and her voice was filled with warmth. She naturally had no idea that Marcus had left during the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. How about you?" Marcus responded with a gentle smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina nodded eagerly, and her bright eyes sparkled with affection. Then, as if recalling something, she tilted her head. "Since you're in Kingston, are you planning to visit Natalia?" Aware of Marcus' bond with Natalia, Melina, though possessive, didn't wish for him to neglect her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled and pulled her into his embrace, "Yes, I plan to see her today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina nodded again, and her tone was understanding. "Okay, go ahead. If anything comes up, don't worry about me. I'll come find you in Solomia if I miss you." Her thoughtfulness stirred a wave of tenderness in Marcus' heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a simple breakfast, Marcus left the villa and headed to Kingston University, intending to surprise Natalia without notifying her in advance. Upon entering the university campus, he felt the youthful vibrance in the air. Having visited before, he knew the location of Natalia's dorm and made his way there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he approached, he spotted a familiar figure. A girl stood with her back to him, dressed in a light-colored blouse and a gray pleated skirt that revealed her legs. Even from behind, her elegance was captivating. It was Natalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Warmth filled Marcus' heart at the sight of her, and the familiar silhouette stirred a sense of nostalgia. However, three male students stood in front of Natalia, one of them speaking to her with an overbearing tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Natalia, Isaac has taken an interest in you. Don't be ungrateful. You'd better show some respect, or you won't be stepping back into your dorm," the boy sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Disdain marred Natalia's delicate face as she retorted, "I've already told you&mdash;I have a boyfriend, and I'm not interested in meeting anyone. Patrick, why won't you leave me alone?" Even from a distance, Marcus could sense the helplessness in her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick snorted coldly, "Leave you alone? Do you even know your place? You're just a backwater girl from Solomia. The fact that I even considered you was a blessing. But Isaac is from the prestigious Crankhurst family. You should feel honored to catch his eye. If you agree to be with him, your life will be set."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Patrick spoke, his eyes roved shamelessly over Natalia's figure and filled with lust. Despite being a mere side branch of Kingston's prominent Whitman family, Patrick carried himself with arrogance, believing his lineage made him far superior to others.</span></p></div>
