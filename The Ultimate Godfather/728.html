  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me, how did you get all that money?" Hadley asked Natalie after taking a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Natalie had a chance to respond, Noel sneered, "This kind of electronic contract and authorization letter can be forged by any copy shop on the street. Do you really believe they are legitimate? I told you a long time ago that with today's technology, even a living person could be fake, let alone an electronic contract and authorization letter!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words enlightened Hadley. She reacted immediately and snorted, "If Noel hadn't reminded me, I would have almost been fooled by you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This authorization letter and contract must have been forged by you. Which copy shop did you go to? Please recommend it to me. I might need it later. How much did it cost in total?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley's words betrayed evident sarcasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of arguing with her, Natalie made a phone call. "Fire Hadley, the manager of the flagship store in Kingston, right now, and replace her with the deputy manager!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the exclusive agent of the brand in </span><span>Uswad</span><span> and the owner of eight stores, she naturally had the right to appoint and dismiss her employees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her call went directly to the human resources department at headquarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The department manager at the headquarters attached great importance to her order and immediately carried it out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley was still oblivious to the impending trouble she was in. As she watched Natalie make a call, the sneer on her face grew even more pronounced. "Natalie, you're truly an excellent actress. After fabricating the authorization letter and contract, you're acting like you're calling the headquarters now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you actually fancy yourself as the boss now? My performance at the flagship store in Kingston is quite outstanding. With a black diamond VIP member like Noel supporting me, how could the brand fire me? Are you here to tell jokes?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley's words caused Noel to laugh proudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also assumed that she was just bluffing in an attempt to scare Hadley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in his opinion, her method was too childish!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as soon as Hadley finished her words, her phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She answered the call subconsciously and said impatiently, "I'm on annual leave. If there are any issues, just have the deputy store manager take care of them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, a voice emerged from the phone, saying, "I'm not phoning you regarding work matters. Instead, I'm here to notify you that you've been fired!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley's face darkened, and she trembled as if struck by lightning and asked in disbelief, "Are you mistaken? I'm the manager of the flagship store in Kingston. Many </span><span>celebrities and prominent families are my customers. Why are you firing me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The caller replied icily, "You don't have to be so worked up when talking to me. This has nothing to do with me. I'm just conveying the boss' instructions!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley felt displeased and instinctively asked, "You are talking nonsense. The boss was discussing the work plan with me just an hour ago. There's no way he would fire me now. You must be trying to deceive me, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The caller became more and more impatient. "I believe you're clearly mistaken. Just an hour ago, our eight stores in </span><span>Uswad</span><span> and the exclusive brand agency rights were acquired by someone else. As a result, the boss has been replaced."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley's heart skipped a beat. A sense of foreboding crept over her, and she asked, "Who is the new boss? What is his or her name?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Her name is Natalie Vance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After listening to the final sentence over the phone, Hadley was utterly dumbfounded. A wave of dizziness washed over her, nearly causing her to collapse to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Natalie really acquired eight stores and the exclusive agency rights of the brand. How is it possible? How is this possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley felt as if she were in a dream, her eyes brimming with shock and horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Natalie's voice rang out. "Hadley, do you still think I'm acting now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley's face turned extremely livid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't easy for her to become the manager of the flagship store in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition to working hard, she also resorted to conspiracy and trickery to take away Natalie's opportunity in order to secure this position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to this position, her salary doubled, and she managed to find a boyfriend like Noel. In essence, this position transformed her destiny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, a single word from Natalie ruined everything that she had made every effort to get.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This left Hadley shocked and simultaneously kindled a fierce hatred for Natalie within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gritted her teeth and growled, "Natalie, don't get cocky just yet. Noel is my boyfriend, and I will marry into the Ortega family in the future. </span><span>So</span><span> what if I lose this job? I can still be a rich lady and enjoy billions of dollars in assets in the future!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what about you? Your boyfriend is just a nobody. What can he give you? So, even after firing me, you still have no right to be arrogant in front of me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Hadley couldn't help but look at Noel, as if seeking an affirmative response from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded and promised, "Hadley, don't worry. I will definitely avenge you. Even though she has acquired those stores, I am still far superior to her!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
