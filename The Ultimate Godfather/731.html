        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Noel, let's talk properly. Why are you hitting me? What did I do wrong?" Hadley struggled as she asked, her voice full of grievance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I already told you, it's because you insisted on bringing me here that I offended someone important. Now my family has lost everything because of you. If things continue like this, we'll never recover!" Noel gritted his teeth as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't a public setting, he might have even had the urge to kill Hadley there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In </span><span>Uswad</span><span>, there had long been a saying that some people would bring misfortune to their partners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Noel's father first saw Hadley, he warned Noel that she would bring misfortune to Noel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the time, Noel dismissed it, thinking his father was just trying to scare him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kept dating with Hadley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, recalling his father's warning, Noel deeply regretted not listening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how he looked at Hadley, Hadley truly had brought misfortune to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This only reinforced Noel's belief that all of his misfortune today was caused by Hadley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley, with a face full of grievance, couldn't help but ask, "Noel, who is this important person you're talking about? This market is so ordinary. Where could there be someone important? Are you out of your mind? Maybe I should take you to see a doctor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Hadley struggled to stand up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noel slapped her face again and snarled, "Bitch, listen to me carefully. Marcus is an important person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's because I offended him that Battle God Oliver had to personally communicate with Jasper, and the Ortega family locked up all of our family's accounts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it weren't for you, pushing me to offend Natalie, how would I have gotten into conflict with Mr. Fitzgerald? Everything that's happened to me is because of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Hadley was utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her entire body trembled as if struck by a blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Marcus with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "An important person? How could he be important? He's just a country bumpkin! How could a single phone call from him make Noel's family lose everything? What on earth is going on here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley covered her cheek, her face filled with incredulity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, she even forgot about the pain in her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how hard she tried to </span><span>reason,</span><span> she couldn't accept this reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason was simple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Hadley's mind, she had always been far superior to Natalie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they had been close friends in the past, Hadley had always harbored a secret desire to trample Natalie down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her promotion to store manager in Kingston was the first step in stepping on Natalie's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, when they met at the market, Hadley thought that, with her new role as the Kingston flagship store manager and Noel as her boyfriend, it was time to crush Natalie once and for all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she never expected that the once low-key Natalie had already become someone beyond her reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First, Marcus had acquired eight stores from the brand owner, and with just one phone call, Hadley lost her job.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had thought Noel could help her get things back on track.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead, she realized that Noel, who she considered so important, was nothing in front of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With another phone call, Marcus made Noel lose everything, including their family's financial accounts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything felt too surreal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadley couldn't believe it. She even wondered, "Is this karma?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it payback for all the harm I had caused Natalie?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Hadley could process her thoughts, she saw Noel step forward to Marcus, bow in front of him, and plead in public, "Mr. Fitzgerald, I was blind before. I didn't recognize your greatness and offended you. Please, forgive me this time. I beg you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was just misled by that bitch, and that's why I did all those foolish things..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at Noel and said, "Weren't you very arrogant before? How come you're now bowing and begging me? Do you regret your previous actions?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Marcus' words, Noel immediately began to bow deeply, his face full of misery. "Mr. Fitzgerald, I know I was wrong. I really know I was wrong. It was all my foolishness. Please, give me a chance to change. I'm willing to do anything for you to make up for it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Noel's body trembled uncontrollably, making him utterly miserable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Natalie, who had been worried earlier, was now completely stunned, her face filled with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "How could this be? How could this happen? Marcus, with just one phone call, made Battle God Oliver serve him. Even Jasper was involved. Does this </span><span>mean Marcus is even more prestigious than Battle God Oliver?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As these thoughts raced through Natalie's mind, her heart trembled uncontrollably. She couldn't bear to think any further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ortega family was the top family in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>. How could Marcus, no matter how noble he was, be above them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This completely shattered Natalie's understanding of things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers were also shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some even dug up Noel's background.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was from the Ortega family, yet here he was, bowing and apologizing to this young man in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he was repeatedly bowing as well?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of person was this young man?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked at Noel with mockery and said, "I used to think you were a person of some backbone, but it looks like I overestimated you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he raised his muddy foot and said to Noel, "If you want me to forgive you, it's not impossible. Lick my shoes clean, and I'll have the Ortega family unlock your father's accounts right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At these words, the crowd gasped in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Licking shoes in public!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was an unimaginable humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any person with even a shred of dignity would find it hard to accept such an insult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many felt that Marcus' demand was outrageous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus had no intention of letting Noel off easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason was simple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This world was a brutal one, where the strong trampled the weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he didn't have such a prestigious background, it would be him licking Noel's shoes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noel's face turned dark with shame. His heart burned with humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he knew that if he didn't comply, his family would be finished. There would be no chance to recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Licking the shoes was his only chance at survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if it meant losing his dignity, losing his humanity, he had no choice but to do it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, with all eyes on him, Noel lay at Marcus' feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cupped Marcus' muddy foot with both hands and began to lick his shoes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, Noel could barely endure the disgusting taste and kept gagging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was important to note that he had a severe obsession with cleanliness. He had even complained about how dirty the market was when Hadley had dragged him there for dinner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, less than an hour later, this man who was so obsessive about cleanliness was now reduced to licking someone's shoes in public!</span></p></div>
