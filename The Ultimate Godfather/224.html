  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since her daughter was on holiday, Josie slept until 9 o'clock the next day morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie was sleepy after waking up, but still very beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hug me, honey..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Josie opened her arms, her breasts trembled, which made Marcus feel hot again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held Josie in his arms and said, "Dress up. I'll take you to buy a house today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie looked excited, and then she became rational again, saying, "Why should we buy a house? I'm used to living here, and I don't want you to spend money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said, "This community is very old, and the people living here are not good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, I wouldn't have met that drunkard yesterday."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing Marcus' words, Josie nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was not the first time she had encountered someone harassing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, she just scared the other party, and then they would back off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, no matter how she tried to scare the drunk guy yesterday, he kept following her. It was really scary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't feel comfortable with you living alone in a community like this. I'm going to buy you a villa with a private entrance, yard, and two security guards. Then I can let you live there with peace of mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus touched Josie's nose and looked doting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie felt the long-lost feeling of being pampered, saying, "Then I'll listen to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus then nodded with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Josie quickly ran to the bathroom to wash up and then spent less than half an hour putting on her makeup. Then she drove her Mercedes-Benz away from Sunshine Estates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not familiar with Kingston. If you have a neighborhood you like, you can take me there to have a look. Don't worry about the price. I'm not short of money," Marcus said to Josie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie looked at Marcus in the passenger seat lovingly and said, "Flourish Manor. I have been interested in that community, but a villa </span><span>there</span><span> costs hundreds of millions of </span><span>dollars, so I have never been willing to buy it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus immediately decided, "Then let's go to Flourish Manor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie nodded happily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a native of Kingston, Josie had always been paying attention to the new real estate in Kingston, so she was also quite familiar with the pros and cons of these new buildings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flourish Manor only had villas there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it was not located in the most central area, it was close to Central Park, had an excellent surrounding environment, complete supporting facilities, and a very good campus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It could be said that it was quiet inside and bustling outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, a villa cost about 100 million dollars, which was not very expensive in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, sales of Flourish Manor had been very hot since its launch, and several plots were sold out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie was no longer sure whether she could buy the house she wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since today was the weekend, many people came to Flourish Manor to look at houses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sales staff were a little overwhelmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie parked the car, took Marcus' arm, and entered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were greeted by a young female salesperson in her 20s, who looked like a recent college graduate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her business ability was very good, and she was also very friendly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Flourish Manor has attracted attention from all parties in the industry since its launch. It is also known as the most cost-effective villa area in Kingston and is the first choice for cultured people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is an honor for our manor that you two are interested in it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We are currently mainly selling Plot 5, which has a prime location and a very good environment. There is a subway station just outside, and it is only 1.2 miles away from the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At present, there are still three houses with good locations that have not been sold. The other two have been booked. Only this one by the lake is left. The price is 130 million dollars. If you order now, I can ask the manager for a discount for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The salesperson introduced it to Marcus and Josie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had been looking at the sand table, analyzing the pros and cons of the land and buildings from various locations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the recommendation of the salesperson, the villa did have a relatively advantageous location in Plot 5.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you like it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus turned to Josie and asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie looked excited and nodded vigorously to Marcus. In her mind, she already began to imagine her and her daughter living in this villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll buy this villa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said to the salesperson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The salesperson gave a charming smile and prepared to process the procedures for Marcus and Josie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, the sales manager came over with another man and a woman and said directly to the salesperson, "This villa is no longer for sale. Mr. White and his wife bought it!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
