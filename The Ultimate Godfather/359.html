  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar's heart was filled with regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze toward Marcus had completely changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "If I know Marcus wields such influence, I would never dare to cross him over a mere inspection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now it is too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only am I facing suspension and investigation, but Benjamin is determined to dismantle Ryder and our entire faction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This means all my past violations will be exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A lengthy prison sentence seems inevitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything is over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only I stayed in my role as deputy director and avoided offending someone so powerful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, Oscar and Ryder were taken away in police cars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The criminal investigation team also left the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin, Brenden, and Theodore turned their attention to Marcus. "Mr. Fitzgerald, Ryder did not hurt you, did he?" they asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus shook his head. "Thank you all for your tremendous support this time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them quickly waved it off, acting as if it was no big deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Amelia knew Marcus was important to Benjamin, the scene still shocked her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always thought Benjamin treated Marcus as a junior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, it was clear that was not the case.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judging by Benjamin's respect for Marcus, their roles should have been reversed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To save Marcus, Benjamin had even called in Brenden and Theodore, exhausting all his resources.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Amelia realize Marcus' significance to Benjamin was far greater than she had imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mayor Benjamin, from what Ryder said, it seems he has backed by someone powerful. By helping me, have you put yourself at risk?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin smiled dismissively and briefly explained Ryder's connections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have been at odds in the City Hall for years. This confrontation was inevitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It just happened a bit earlier because of this incident. I have already prepared for the consequences, so do not blame yourself, Mr. Fitzgerald. At worst, I will resign from my position."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Benjamin said this, he had the look of someone standing on moral high ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Known for his honesty, he could not stand corrupt officials like Ryder&mdash;if he were not so upright, he might have teamed up with him long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin's righteous demeanor impressed Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following Benjamin's orders, the Engineering Department completed the inspection of the Pharmaceutical Industrial Park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant the park could officially begin operations as soon as the production equipment was installed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, the operation to capture the key members of the Black Hawk Legion is the day after tomorrow. Maxine told me she invited you to join. With your help, our Solomia Special Police Academy is sure to excel!" Brenden said with a laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brenden greatly admired Marcus, a young man with knowledge, wealth, and strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, Brenden was not optimistic about the operation due to Edward's absence. But after learning Marcus would participate, his confidence soared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do not worry, Mr. Wilde. I will do my best to assist Maxine with this mission," Marcus replied with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, Marcus would not have agreed if not for Maxine's request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after the help Brenden provided today, he could not refuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Brenden and Theodore left, Benjamin received a call from Lilian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Benjamin, what is taking you so long? Mr. Griffin and the others are getting impatient. Hurry back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was handling something. Tell Mr. Griffin to wait a bit; I will be back soon," Benjamin replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up, he turned to Marcus. "Mr. Fitzgerald, the Crankhurst delegation is visiting Solomia and currently at my house. Why not come with me? We can also discuss Ryder's situation further."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since today's events might implicate Benjamin, he wanted to help Benjamin come up with countermeasures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two got into Benjamin's Maybach sedan and headed to the Mitchell Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite serving as Solomia's mayor for over 30 years, Benjamin was known for his integrity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lived in a modest local apartment complex. The apartment was about 1,400 square feet, simply decorated but clean and exuding a scholarly atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they entered, Lilian looked surprised but quickly recovered. "Mr. Fitzgerald, please come in!" she said warmly. "Grace, Mr. Fitzgerald is here! Did you not always say you wanted to meet him? Hurry over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, Grace ran to the door, her face full of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to Marcus' treatment, her leukemia had been completely cured.</span></p><div class="pagination">
