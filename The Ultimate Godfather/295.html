  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Melinda, we're family, so let's get something straight. I've told you before that even if Marcus lives at his wife's house, that's his business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As his uncle, would I laugh at him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick said immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As far as Nick was concerned, Marcus couldn't have bought such a large villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew better than anyone how Richard was doing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over the past years, Richard had been making money from farming. It was only enough for his family's daily expenses, so how could he afford to buy a villa?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's right, Melinda. We're family, and you don't have to hide anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Look, I've told you before that Lisa has done a pretty brisk business with her stall at the wholesale market, and she can make at least two to three hundred thousand dollars a year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Also, her husband is the deputy manager of that wholesale market, so her business will only get better from now on," Aria chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aria's words sounded like she was comforting Melinda outwardly, but she was actually showing off her daughter's success more than anything else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Richard and Melinda looked at each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They didn't realize that they hadn't seen each other in just a few years, but the way Nick and Aria talked seemed to have changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't care about that, and he asked Nick, "Uncle Nick, what's wrong with you? I can cure you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In any case, Nick was Richard's biological brother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Besides, Nick was nice to Marcus when he was a little boy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Nick was sick, Marcus tried to do him a favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd even cured cancer for normal people with Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, and he didn't think Nick looked badly sick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus, don't be ridiculous. I've got aged disease, and it's cerebral infarction. I can't get cured in the hospitals in our state, so I've come to Solomia to come to you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I know you're being kind, but how can you possibly know anything about medicine? I remember you have very little education," Nick said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Uncle Nick, I can indeed cure your cerebral infarction. Just let me try," Marcus smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The cerebral infarction was nothing more than a vascular occlusion in the brain, and Marcus' Timeless Numinous Energy had the effect of dredging the vessels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Marcus' mind, he could cure Nick in five minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus, you have no idea how sick Nick is. He passed out at home yesterday, and I was so frightened that we had to come to you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You'd better take Nick to the hospital," Aria continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mom, I told you not to come to Uncle Richard's house, but you wouldn't listen to me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've worked at Solomia for years, so how about I take you to the hospital? Why do we have to come here? Marcus seems so unreliable right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lisa whispered to Aria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her voice was low, but everyone present could hear her clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I thought Marcus had married into a rich family and that he could have connections at the hospital, but I didn't realize how unreliable he'd become now," Aria explained hastily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mom, my boyfriend is also a native of Solomia, and he's the deputy manager of the wholesale market. He also knows someone at the hospital, so he's better than Marcus anyway. I truly had no idea why you came to Uncle Richard's house."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Upon hearing Aria and Lisa's conversation, Nick glared at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was Nick's brother's house, and he didn't feel good about them talking about Marcus like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aria and Lisa fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They seemed to feel it was awkward as Melinda hurriedly told Marcus, "Marcus, hurry up and take Nick to the hospital. I heard that you know a director at the hospital, so just let him treat Nick."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't say anything else, and they walked out of the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Marcus' Aston Martin parked in the yard, Nick and Aria immediately gathered around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aria said, "It's a nice car, but it's just too small and doesn't seem as expansive as the one Lisa's boyfriend has."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick also nodded. "Lisa told her that her boyfriend drove an Audi A6, which was worth sixty thousand dollars and was definitely better than this one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though Lisa was a woman, she knew luxury cars as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She instantly recognized it was an Aston Martin worth three hundred thousand dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lisa was muttering in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Lisa asked Marcus, "Marcus, you're taking Nick to the doctor, but why have you rented a sports car? Will it be big enough to carry us?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You seemed so honest when you were a child, but why are you so vain now? We're relatives. Even if your married life is hard, we won't laugh at you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I am living well now. My boyfriend is a native of Solomia, and he knows a lot of people. If you have any difficulty, just let me know. You don't have to be so vain, and it's useless."</span></p><div class="pagination">
