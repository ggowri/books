        <h1>Chapter 201 Shaun's Fury</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine was supposed to be Shaun's </span><span>fiancee</span><span>, and this was no secret in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, besides celebrating Matthew's birthday, Shaun had another important goal: to propose to Maxine and discuss their wedding plans with the Burnett family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as soon as Shaun entered the Burnett Villa, he saw Maxine, who was about to marry him, publicly kissing another man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, a burning rage surged within Shaun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not just Shaun but everyone who had come with him also wore expressions of fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's actions not only showed no respect for the Whitman family but were also a blatant insult to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maxine, how dare you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm's cold voice pierced through the tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ruth's face turned ashen with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's behavior had completely blindsided them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And with Shaun's arrival, their carefully laid plans were at risk of being ruined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine paid no attention to the reactions around her, continuing the kiss for quite a while before finally pulling away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her beautiful eyes locked onto Marcus, a faint blush coloring her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is unbelievable... this is unbelievable...!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew gasped in fury, coughing as he turned to Owen, Maxine's father. "Owen, this is the daughter you raised?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen's face darkened. He never expected his daughter to make such a reckless move. He shot a stern look at Maxine. "Maxine, apologize to your grandfather immediately. Don't make him worry any further!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine didn't respond, her expression one of defiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Guys, get this damned bastard out of here!" Malcolm barked at the Burnett family servant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, a dozen security guards dressed in black, armed with nightsticks, charged toward them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine stepped in front of Marcus, her voice fierce as she shouted, "I dare you to touch him! Get out of the way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The security guards froze, their faces darkening as they dared not move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a round of applause echoed through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone turned to see Shaun walking toward them, a cold smirk on his face. "Quite the spectacle. Truly, a spectacle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maxine, you've gone so far as to publicly clash with your family over a nobody. I must say, Maxine, you've really opened my eyes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaun's eyes scanned Maxine's face, his tone dripping with mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always liked her, considering her his future bride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But seeing her kiss another man had suddenly turned his affection into hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even so, he would still marry her. Then he would make her pay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would have this woman begging, enduring endless humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Burnett family members' faces turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaun was angry, and they had no idea how to handle it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm quickly stepped forward, wearing an insincere smile. "Maxine's always been willful. I'm sure she just kissed this man to provoke us. Mr. Whitman, please don't take it to heart. You and Maxine's marriage plans should proceed as planned."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaun's gaze swept over Marcus, hatred radiating from his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, "The important matter comes first, but this guy kissed my woman in public. He's going to pay a heavy price for this later!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bring it here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaun waved his hand, and his subordinates stepped forward with the gifts he had brought for Matthew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the heir of the Whitman family, Shaun's gifts naturally became the center of attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a grand gesture! Now, this is what I call a grand gesture!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Indeed, the Whitman family lives up to their reputation as one of Kingston's four major families. Each of these treasures is a rare gem! Truly eye-opening!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the crowd marveled at the rare and exquisite items, many whispered in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though all present were from Kingston's upper crust, they were still no match for the Whitman family's wealth and power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir Burnett, happy birthday. I've brought a small token of my appreciation, and I hope you accept it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaun bowed respectfully to Matthew, his demeanor polite and graceful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaun's every action perfectly matched the expectations of the Burnett family, and Matthew found himself liking him more and more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sincerity Shaun had shown was clear, even </span><span>through</span><span> the extravagant gifts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shaun, you're too kind," Matthew said with a warm smile. "When you marry Maxine, we'll be family; no need for such formality."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaun's gaze shifted briefly to Maxine and Marcus before turning back to Matthew. "I've always had a great fondness for Maxine. The other reason I came today was to propose to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, Maxine's actions earlier have left me a little disappointed. I was wondering if you could offer an explanation."</span></p></div>
