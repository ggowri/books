  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the thug's hand could land on her, a larger hand grabbed his wrist midair, stopping him cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression twisted in frustration as he turned his gaze to Marcus, gritting his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you seriously trying to stick your nose where it doesn't belong? I'm warning you&mdash;let me go right now. I work for Sebastien. You really don't want to mess with us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he finished speaking, Marcus didn't bother with a response&mdash;he just swung a slap across the guy's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was sent flying, his nose instantly gushing blood, teeth scattering across the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest of the gang immediately tensed up, their faces darkening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them snarled, "You son of a bitch, you seriously think you can mess with us? You hit one of our guys&mdash;now you're gonna pay for it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a silent exchange of glances, they moved in at once, closing in on Marcus from all sides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These weren't just random thugs. They were Sebastien's personal goons&mdash;low-level criminals who followed him around like attack dogs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't play fair, either. One of them even pulled a knife from his pocket, lunging straight for Marcus with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight made Morgana and Nicole's hearts pound in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look out!" Morgana instinctively shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But these men were nothing more than pests to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sounds of fists meeting flesh echoed through the dormitory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus moved like a blur, his fists cutting through the gang like a blade through paper. They never even stood a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than two minutes, every last one of them was sprawled on the floor, groaning in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dusting off his hands, Marcus turned his attention to Sebastien, his expression calm yet menacing.</span><br><span>"Who the hell gave you the guts to even think about touching my sister?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastien's eyes flickered with uncertainty. He studied Marcus for a moment before sneering, "So, you're her brother. Guess that makes sense. But let me make something clear&mdash;you just beat up my guys. You have no idea what kind of shitstorm you've walked into. My dad is Garrick Faust, chairman of Faust Properties. My uncle? Chief of police for this entire district. You think you can get away with this? You're dead, bitch. Dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even now, Sebastien was still acting untouchable&mdash;completely oblivious to just how badly he had miscalculated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could finish running his mouth&mdash;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' fist smashed into his face, sending him crashing to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastien let out a guttural groan, his mouth instantly filling with blood as two of his front teeth flew out, landing a few feet away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You motherfucker!" he shrieked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You actually hit me? Do you even know who I am? You're dead! You hear me? DEAD! I'm calling my dad right now&mdash;he's gonna wipe you off the damn map!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't let him finish. With one swift motion, he drove his foot into Sebastien's stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastien let out a blood-curdling scream, his body curling up on the floor like a dying shrimp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You open that mouth one more time, I swear to God, I'll make sure you can't talk ever again," Marcus said coldly, his fist raised, ready to strike again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!" Morgana suddenly stepped forward, blocking his path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you keep going, this might turn into something we can't fix! Sebastien's father is the chairman of Faust Properties&mdash;you think he won't come after you for this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had heard of Faust Properties before&mdash;it was one of Solomia's most prominent real estate companies, with a massive portfolio of properties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to its strong sales performance, its market valuation had recently surpassed 100 billion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The company had expanded its operations across multiple provinces, and its developments were widely recognized in the industry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the helm of it all was Garrick Faust, the CEO, who had consistently ranked in the top twenty of Solomia's wealthiest individuals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But more importantly, his older brother, Regis Faust, was the Chief of Police.</span></p><div class="pagination">
