  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of this, when Melina introduced Marcus, a young man from the small town of Solomia, as her boyfriend, her parents, Davey and Kari, were furious. They believed Melina had no ambition and was not even remotely comparable to Cloe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their tone carried a hint of frustration as if they couldn't understand their daughter's choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, Mom, you've misunderstood Marcus. Although he's from Solomia, he's not the kind of country bumpkin you think he is!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When we at the Flourish Group managed to secure the Solomia amusement park project, it was all thanks to Marcus' help. His company, Golden Group, is worth over a hundred billion dollars. You could even say he's a benefactor to our Thurman family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina's parents' words stung her deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never imagined that the usually humble and attentive couple would suddenly turn so cold and dismissive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her words, Davey, Kari, Neil, and Cloe all shot Marcus a surprised glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't expected this unassuming young man to be the head of Golden Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, he had once helped the Thurman family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I see. If he's the head of Golden Group, then I apologize for our rudeness," Davey said, his tone now much more polite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kari shot Marcus a look of apology as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never expected her daughter to be dating someone with such influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given that Marcus was in charge of a company worth a hundred billion dollars, it was, at the very least, a match that could be considered reasonable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But compared to Cloe's boyfriend, it was still far behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The difference was simple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Whitman family in Kingston could never be compared to a company from a small place like Solomia, no matter how large.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Landon, the son of the Whitman family head, was set to inherit the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no one in Uswad who could compare to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Melina introduced Marcus' background, Davey, Kari, Neil, and Cloe, all appeared slightly surprised, but their expressions quickly returned to calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Landon, he hadn't seemed to pay much attention to Marcus from the beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus could easily sense the change in the Thurman family's mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waving his hand lightly at Davey and Kari, he said, "There's no need to be formal. I'm here mainly to check on Sir Thurman's condition."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, the group cast Marcus a questioning look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before anyone could speak, Melina awkwardly explained, "Marcus knows a bit about medicine, so I thought I'd ask him to check on Grandpa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Melina spoke, she felt uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her eyes, Marcus was incredibly capable, responsible, and very handsome. She believed he was a </span><span>responsible </span><span>man</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when it came to medical expertise, Melina wasn't entirely convinced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt he might know a little, but she didn't think he would be of much help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nonsense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish, Melina's uncle, Neil, cut her off with a sharp reprimand. "Melina, are you unaware of your grandfather's condition?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His cancer is in its final stages. After the surgery in Acoton, we've hired the best doctors from all over the world. The medical bills alone have cost us over a hundred million dollars, and yet there's no cure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you honestly think a young man in his twenties could do anything about your grandfather's cancer?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With your grandfather's condition, getting Mr. Zack to extend his life for a few more days is already a huge blessing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kari pulled at Melina's sleeve, adding, "Yes, Melina, although Marcus is young and worth a fortune, let's not get ahead of ourselves. He's too young to treat your grandfather..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kari didn't directly say it, but the meaning was clear. She didn't believe Marcus had the ability to treat Bowden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough! Quiet down! Don't you see I'm trying to help Sir Thurman? If you keep talking, you'll disturb my ritual, and that could ruin the whole thing. If the life extension fails, I won't take responsibility!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom finally spoke, his voice tinged with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the Thurman family immediately fell silent, not daring to speak further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Tom had only agreed to perform the life-extending ritual because of Landon's request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without Landon's backing, no amount of money from the Thurman family could have hired someone with Tom's abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Zack is right," Landon added, his calm voice cutting through the tension. "Everyone, please calm down. Don't let an insignificant person interfere with Mr. Zack's work for Sir Thurman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The "insignificant person" he referred to, of course, was Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Thurman family members exchanged guilty glances, realizing that if Marcus caused the life extension to fail, they would be completely to blame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you keep insisting on this, all you'll do is strip Sir Thurman of any chance for recovery!" Marcus' words were heavy with finality.</span></p><div class="pagination">
