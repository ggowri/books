        <h1>Chapter 985 The Missing Girl Case-2</h1>
        <div><p>He planned to visit Serpent&#x27;s Coil again the next day to distribute all the cultivation resources he no longer needed.</p><p>Additionally, Diana recently succeeded in modifying nearly two thousand Energy Crystal guns.</p><p>He decided to give 1,500 to Kingston&#x27;s Axe Gang, while the remaining 500 would be distributed to people he knew.</p><p>This way, it would not only boost the overall strength of the Axe Gang but also ensure the people around him had enough self-defense capability.</p><p>Besides that, Marcus also planned to keep collecting cultivation resources, striving to strengthen everyone around him simultaneously.</p><p>Only this way could he handle his own affairs with more peace of mind.</p><p>After all, he already had many enemies. Even without this incident, too many people wanted to deal with him, including his two brothers whom he had never met.</p><p>Only by continuously enhancing his strength and the strength of those around him could they have the ability to protect themselves when a crisis arises.</p><p>&quot;Buzz, buzz...&quot;</p><p>At this moment, a wave of energy rippled through the void.</p><p>Marcus instantly unleashed his spiritual powers, taking in everything around him.</p><p>He discovered several figures fiercely battling in a mountain range in the northern part of Solomia.</p><p>Their cultivation was roughly equivalent to Ancient Martial Stage Nine, with several of them besieging a stunning young girl in a white gauze dress.</p><p>These people were not only powerful but also emitted an aura distinctly different from warriors.</p><p>This aura was extremely eerie, exuding a faint sense of evil, making Marcus feel deeply unfamiliar.</p><p>He recalled everyone he had encountered before, none of whom had ever emitted such an aura.</p><p>It did not belong to warriors, Wizards, or metahumans.</p><p>As for practitioners of other professions, Marcus had encountered them more or less, but their aura was fundamentally different from these people.</p><p>He continued to amplify his spiritual powers and discovered that the stunning young girl under siege was actually Ada&#x27;s cousin from the Celestial Arc Order, Gertie.</p><p>After multiple Dual Cultivations with Marcus, Gertie&#x27;s cultivation level had successfully advanced to Ancient Martial Stage Nine, greatly enhancing her strength.</p><p>However, under the siege of this group of enemies, she still struggled to cope. A trace of blood stained the corner of her mouth, indicating that she was clearly injured.</p><p>Seeing this, Marcus couldn&#x27;t help but frown.</p><p>He stopped the car without hesitation in a parking spot by the roadside.</p><p>The parking attendant was just about to issue a ticket to collect the parking fee, but his figure had already vanished in an instant.</p><p>The attendant asked in confusion, &quot;Where did he go?&quot;</p><p>Marcus had already teleported to the distant mountains.</p><p>The bearded man blatantly sized up Gertie and said to the elder beside him, &quot;The women in this cage are really something, all so beautiful. The ones we caught these past two days were already great, but I didn&#x27;t expect today&#x27;s catch to be even more stunning! If we take her back, the boss will definitely love her!&quot;</p><p>The elder nodded with a smile and agreed, &quot;This is the forgotten world. I didn&#x27;t expect its allure to be no less than our continent, at least when it comes to women!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Indeed, over the past few days, I&#x27;ve already Dual Cultivated with several women. My cultivation has advanced significantly. It seems the master was absolutely right to send us here. Although I don&#x27;t know what exactly is his purpose, we can certainly enjoy ourselves!&quot; The bearded man smirked wickedly, exuding an inexplicable sense of superiority.</p><p>As he spoke, he suddenly struck a palm toward Gertie.</p><p>Surrounded and attacked by so many, Gertie was already seriously injured.</p><p>Facing the bearded man&#x27;s Hand Strike, she found it hard to resist.</p><p>However, just as she was about to desperately resist, a figure silently appeared in front of her, casually striking out a palm and effortlessly blocking the bearded man&#x27;s Hand Strike.</p><p>In the next moment, a thunderous boom echoed through the valley.</p><p>The bearded man&#x27;s gaze tightened slightly. He hadn&#x27;t expected someone to come to Gertie&#x27;s rescue.</p><p>&quot;Who are you? How dare you meddle? Since you&#x27;re here, prepare to die!&quot; he said coldly.</p><p>At the same time, he suddenly infused terrifying power into his Hand Strike, attempting to completely suppress Marcus here.</p><p>However, as their attacks clashed more intensely, his expression suddenly turned utterly horrified.</p><p>He felt an irresistible force surging wildly into his body, almost tearing him apart!</p></div>
