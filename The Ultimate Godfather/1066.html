  <div class="container"><p style="text-align:left;">Hearing this, Eulalia and Isolde immediately showed expressions of astonishment on their faces.</p><p style="text-align:left;">They knew Thorne was wealthy but never imagined he would have so much money!</p><p style="text-align:left;">And Thorne had claimed that the eight or nine hundred million was only his savings, not including his parents&#x27; savings.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His parents were high-ranking government officials, and how many officials were honest and clean-handed these days?</p><p style="text-align:left;">It meant that his family&#x27;s wealth was was likely an astronomical number.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Looking at Thorne&#x27;s smug face, Chloe rolled her eyes.</p><p style="text-align:left;"><em>Eight or nine hundred million dollars, and he had the nerve to show off?</em></p><p style="text-align:left;">Chloe knew Marcus had spent hundreds of billions of dollars to acquire Royal Entertainment.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Plus, he owned many other publicly traded companies, each with a market value exceeding hundreds of billions of dollars.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In other words, Thorne was nothing but a clown compared to Marcus.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Yet he was completely oblivious, showing off in front of Marcus. It was ridiculous!</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;So what do you say, kid? Name your price. As long as it&#x27;s not too much, I can make it happen. With my money, you&#x27;ll be set for life!&quot; Thorne continued, his entire demeanor excessively arrogant.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Marcus raised an eyebrow slightly and asked Thorne, &quot;Isn&#x27;t your annual salary as Sales Director at SiliconWave Technologies only 10 million dollars? Where did you get all that money from?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was what Marcus wanted to know. After all, SiliconWave Technologies was also one of his industries.</p><p style="text-align:left;">If he could discover some parasites within the group at this time and clean them out promptly, why not?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Thorne had no idea that the young man standing before him was actually the secret owner of SiliconWave Technologies.</p><p style="text-align:left;">From his perspective, Marcus was clearly from the bottom rungs of society, so even if he revealed his money-making schemes, the guy couldn&#x27;t do anything about it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">So Thorne said, &quot;You seem to have a screw loose. No wonder you&#x27;re stuck at the bottom of society forever. Salaries are fixed, but people are flexible.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He continued, &quot;My position as sales director isn&#x27;t just for show. You honestly think I only make that 10 million dollars each year? Let me tell you the truth! My influence at SiliconWave Technologies is beyond your imagination. I can easily skim a little off the top, and boom, there&#x27;s my money. Do you see any rich person making a fortune from their base salary? If you dig into it carefully, every wealthy person has gotten their hands dirty. Don&#x27;t you believe me or not?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Hearing Thorne&#x27;s words, both Eulalia and Isolde couldn&#x27;t help but give him a thumbs up.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Especially Isolde, she would love to embezzle, too. Still, since Cecilia truly took the helm of McHale Pharmaceuticals Group, all the company policies had become extremely strict.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She had no opportunity to embezzle anymore and could only earn her basic salary.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Because of this, Isolde was incredibly envious of Thorne.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Oh, I get it now. So all your money comes from embezzling from SiliconWave Technologies, right?&quot; Marcus said with a smile.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Thorne was about to nod when he quickly realized something, glaring fiercely at Marcus. &quot;Kid, why do I feel like you&#x27;re fishing for information? Tell me, what the fuck are you trying to do?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">No sooner had Thorne finished speaking than Isolde chimed in with a mocking expression. &quot;Thorne, he&#x27;s just an extra, bottom of the social ladder. Even if he knew some secrets, what could he possibly do? You&#x27;re overthinking this!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Thorne laughed loudly. &quot;Haha, right! I was just thinking better safe than sorry.&quot; His gaze toward Marcus was filled with mockery.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Talking to you is a waste of breath. Just name your price already. If you keep stalling, you won&#x27;t get a single penny!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Marcus looked at Thorne and said, &quot;What I want isn&#x27;t your money. It&#x27;s your job.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Hearing Marcus&#x27; words, Thorne&#x27;s expression froze momentarily before a hint of intrigue crossed his face. &quot;Kid, did I hear you right? You want my job? How the hell do you think you&#x27;re going to get that? Are you talking nonsense? I think you&#x27;ve got mental issues!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Eulalia and Isolde couldn&#x27;t help but laugh, their gaze toward Marcus brimming with derision.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Marcus ignored their reactions and said to Thorne, &quot;Taking your job is actually quite simple—I&#x27;ll just have you fired.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Marcus&#x27; shocking statement once again left Eulalia, Isolde, and Thorne stunned, their eyes filled with disbelief as they stared at him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Isolde crossed her arms over her chest and said with a mocking smile, &quot;This guy really does have something wrong with his brain! Chloe, I can&#x27;t believe you found yourself such an idiot for a boyfriend. You should break up with him right away. Look at him spouting nonsense—I&#x27;m genuinely worried he might snap one day and do something crazy to you!&quot;</p><div class="pagination">
