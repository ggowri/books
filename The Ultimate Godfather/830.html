        <h1>Chapter 810 The Rules Are Set by Me!</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Eamon spoke, the men from the Silver Horn Order swiftly stepped forward, surrounding Marcus and Natalia in the center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The salespeople at the 4S shop could not help but feel a rush of fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some who had witnessed the ruthless methods of the underground world trembled with anxiety. They all knew that Marcus and Natalia were about to face a terrible fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Silver Horn Order... Is that the gang that just joined Axe Gang?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' expression remained unchanged. He glanced at Eamon calmly and asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon's face lit up with pride upon hearing Marcus' question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Axe Gang had rapidly become the most powerful gang in Kingston's underground world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only were they strong individually, but they had recently acquired a weapon capable of firing terrifying lasers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In battle, these weapons were invincible, far surpassing regular guns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A single shot could take out even a warrior, instantly killing them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Axe Gang had hundreds of these weapons, one for nearly every member of the gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recently, Axe Gang had used these formidable weapons to dominate Kingston's underground world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even some of the top-ranking gangs in Kingston had been wiped out by Axe Gang in a matter of days!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under such a powerful weapon, no gang could last even a day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this rate, Axe Gang was poised to unify the entire underground world of Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Eamon, the fact that the Silver Horn Order had safely joined Axe Gang and become an important faction under its rule was a huge honor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A high-ranking member of Axe Gang had even promised Eamon that if the Silver Horn Order performed well, they would reward them with two of those laser guns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon eagerly awaited this reward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, Eamon felt no shame about joining Axe Gang. In fact, he felt immense pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yep, we, the Silver Horn Order, have joined Axe Gang and become one of its most important factions. Why do you ask?" Eamon said smugly, snapping back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. McCallany, I can tell this guy is just stalling for time, trying to drag things out with questions like that. Don't pay him any mind, just deal with him directly!" Ronan chimed in eagerly from the side as if the thought of Marcus and Natalia living even a second longer made him uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, Mr. McCallany, hurry up and deal with him. This guy made us lose everything, and he deserves to pay the price!" Kristen added with the same seething anger as if he couldn't wait to rip Marcus apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calm down, everyone. He's already a fish on my chopping board. It's just a matter of time before I deal with him. Don't worry, I'll make him pay a painful price!" Eamon said confidently to Kristen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then turned to Marcus and asked, "You still haven't answered my question."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon's face was full of pride as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In recent days, he had been telling everyone about his affiliation with Axe Gang. It was, without a doubt, the proudest thing in his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt that if he could get his hands on one of those laser guns, it would be the pinnacle of his existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Axe Gang has a rule that no one is allowed to take on tasks without first getting approval and learning about the other party. Did you apply to Axe Gang before mobilizing your people? Did you check my identity first?" Marcus asked Eamon in a tone of scrutiny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Axe Gang was already under his control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long ago, Axe Gang's task assignment system had been chaotic, and Marcus had several times run into these issues.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So he had given the leader of Axe Gang a strict order to improve the system.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it was clear to Marcus that Eamon hadn't adhered to Axe Gang's rules, and this irritated him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon's expression faltered slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected this young man to be so familiar with Axe Gang's rules.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Eamon had first joined Axe Gang, someone had explained these rules to him, but he hadn't paid much attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though they had joined the Axe Gang, the Silver Horn Order still operated independently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Eamon's mind, even if he took on a task without reporting it to Axe Gang, they would never notice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, taking on tasks and making money was one of the most important revenue streams for underground factions, with multiple tasks coming in every day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had to report every task to Axe Gang, it would be too much of a hassle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Eamon was surprised that Marcus knew so much about Axe Gang's internal rules.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked, probing, "Where did you hear about Axe Gang's rule?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied coldly, "It's not something I heard about. I set that rule."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Marcus said this, Eamon, Kristen, Ronan, Lara, and the Lamborghini salespeople all froze in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never expected that Marcus would say such astonishing words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief pause, everyone burst into derisive laughter, their gazes toward Marcus full of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon, in particular, sneered and said, "Are you out of your mind? Who do you think you are, to say something so ridiculous?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Axe Gang is the most powerful gang in Kingston's underground world right now. There's no way they would let a nobody like you set the rules. You're insulting our intelligence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't just Eamon, every member of the Silver Horn Order laughed mockingly as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was, by far, the most laughable thing they had heard in a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronan looked at Marcus with contempt and said, "I used to think you were normal, but it turns out you're just a lunatic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then turned to Eamon and said, "Mr. McCallany, if you let him talk any longer, he'll start claiming he can rule the entire world. I suggest we just stop listening to him and take him down now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, even Eamon started agreeing with Ronan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze turned back to Marcus. Just as he was about to give orders to the Silver Horn Order lackeys, Marcus picked up his phone and dialed a number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, is there something you need?" came Blake's respectful voice from the other end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eamon's here. Come handle this," Marcus said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't elaborate, nor did he add any extra words. But Blake, on the other end of the line, felt as though he had been struck by lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake immediately understood what Marcus meant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up, he quickly dropped everything and rushed toward Marcus' location, following the coordinates he had been given.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really can put on a show, huh? Acting like you're calling the boss of Axe Gang. Do you really think you can scare me with this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus hang up the phone, Eamon immediately sneered, his smile dripping with sarcasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never met anyone so ridiculous as Marcus, and today was certainly the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Eamon even more intrigued. He was curious just how long Marcus could keep up the charade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kristen, Ronan, and Lara also laughed, their expressions full of derision.</span></p></div>
