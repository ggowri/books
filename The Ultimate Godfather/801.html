  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace's eyes were red and puffy, her face pale and weary, like she hadn't slept in days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she saw Marcus arrive, her lips curled into a faint, fragile smile as she climbed into the passenger seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gently took her soft hand, his voice steady and calming. "Your father is an honest man. These charges against him don't hold water. Do you know who ordered his arrest?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace bit her lip, her voice low but laced with frustration. "It was Pablo Ashford."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The guy is from the OIG," Grace added. "He is Ryder Cromwell's brother-in-law?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pieces fell into place in Marcus' mind almost instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought back to the Golden Group's Pharmaceutical Industrial Park inspection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The confrontation with Oscar had stirred quite the storm, catching the attention of Oscar's brother, the vice mayor of </span><span>Solomia</span><span>, Ryder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryder had long been neck-deep in corruption and bribery, constantly undermining Mayor Benjamin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two clashed at every turn, with Ryder often going out of his way to disregard Benjamin's authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin had finally managed to send Ryder to prison, taking advantage of the right opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus recalled Grace mentioning that Ryder had a powerful father-in-law.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with what she had just revealed, everything pointed back to that one person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian, whom Marcus had just rescued a few days ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrest order had been signed by Pablo Ashford, Ryder's brother-in-law.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This could only mean one thing&mdash;Ryder's father-in-law must also be an Ashford.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And in all of </span><span>Uswad</span><span>, there was only one Ashford with the rank and influence to pull this off&mdash;Julian Ashford.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've got it now," Marcus said, giving Grace a reassuring nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace's tired eyes shimmered with hope as she looked at Marcus, her voice pleading. "Mr. Fitzgerald, is there anything you can do to help my father? I don't care if he never gets to be mayor again, but he's worked so hard for so many years. To end up in prison like this&mdash;it's just not fair!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave her a small, confident smile. "Pack your bags. We're heading to Kingston. I'll make sure your father gets out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace let out a shaky breath, her voice softening. "Thank you, Mr. Fitzgerald. Really, thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even with Marcus' reassurance, a seed of doubt lingered in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the one who had given the order was Pablo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ashford family wasn't just powerful&mdash;they were a bona fide political dynasty. Every single member of the family held influential positions, shaping the government and the military from the inside out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In </span><span>Uswad</span><span>, families like the </span><span>Ashfords</span><span> didn't chase public recognition. You wouldn't find them on any lists of prominent families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's why the so-called "Big Four Families" of </span><span>Uswad</span><span>&mdash;the Whitman, Burnett, Ortega, and Brown families&mdash;were all known for their enormous wealth, not their political clout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While those business dynasties could buy out nations with their wealth, they couldn't rival the authority or status of political heavyweights like the </span><span>Ashfords</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Take the </span><span>Ashfords</span><span> as an example. Beyond Julian Ashford, there were several other senior family members who held top-tier roles in </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> political and military sectors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kind of family wasn't just influential&mdash;they were untouchable. Even the most powerful business dynasties wouldn't dare cross them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But political families like the </span><span>Ashfords</span><span> had a different modus operandi. They operated quietly, always staying behind the curtain, far from the public eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, only those deeply connected to </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> political scene truly understood the Ashford family's immense power and influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace knew that Marcus had powerful allies in Kingston, including the likes of Battle God Oliver. Even Oliver, a man of legendary stature, treated Marcus with respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But going up against the </span><span>Ashfords</span><span> was an entirely different challenge, and Grace couldn't help but feel apprehensive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Marcus was her last hope. If anyone could save her father, it was him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And for Benjamin's freedom, Grace was willing to pay any price.</span></p><div class="pagination">
