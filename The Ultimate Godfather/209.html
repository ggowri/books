        <h1>Chapter 208 Ambitious Beyond Measure</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm grinned </span><span>triumphantly,</span><span> his expression nearly manic as he finished speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd stood frozen in </span><span>shock,</span><span> their gazes fixed on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They finally understood why Malcolm had made this public declaration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that what Malcolm wanted was not just the position of the family head but everything that belonged to Owen and Hazel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he succeeded, Owen and Hazel would instantly fall from the position of a respected, powerful family into nothing, left with nothing but their empty hands!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm's ambition was so vast that no one had anticipated it would go this far!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Shaun, a mere bystander, couldn't help but gasp in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give up all your shares... are you planning to leave your brother and his family destitute, Malcolm? You didn't say this to me before!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew's voice was filled with anger as he questioned Malcolm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm sneered coldly. "Dad, ever since we were young, you've always favored Owen. Even when we both established our own careers, you always spoke in his favor!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've had enough of it. From now on, the Burnett family will be mine, and you can </span><span>retire in peace!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew was so furious he was almost out of breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had misjudged Malcolm. Had he known Malcolm harbored such ruthless </span><span>ambition,</span><span> he would never have agreed to this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Malcolm, don't push me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen gasped, clutching his chest as his voice trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What will you do, Owen? Let me give you a piece of advice. Submit to me, or don't blame me for throwing all brotherly affection aside!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm spoke with an air of arrogant confidence. He had waited too long for this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish speaking, ten or more men in black behind Shaun took out their guns, loading them with bullets, ready to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sight of this, everyone in the room finally understood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now they saw why Malcolm was so eager for Maxine to marry Shaun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was all part of a deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm helped Shaun win Maxine's heart, and Shaun, in turn, was helping Malcolm seize the position of family head!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Owen, don't force me. Hand over the shares willingly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm pressed </span><span>again,</span><span> his tone unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Malcolm, my father has always treated you well. Why are you so heartless? And let me warn you, don't push me too far!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine could no longer hold herself back. She drew a gun from her waist, aiming the dark barrel directly at Malcolm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Malcolm remained completely relaxed, a mocking glint in his eyes as he looked at her. "Maxine, when I was still ruling Kingston, you weren't even born yet. Do you really think you have the ability to kill me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your only way out is to marry into the Whitman family. Even if your parents give up all their shares, as Mrs. Whitman, you can make sure they live in comfort. Put the gun down, now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's anger reached its breaking point at the sight of Malcolm's vile smirk. Her teeth ground together as she prepared to pull the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could act, a burst of force came from the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force hit her wrist with pinpoint accuracy, causing the gun to fall from her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd turned to see a middle-aged man in a robe, his face decorated with three thin strands of beard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a warrior from the Astral Serpent Order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did everyone realize Malcolm had the support of the Astral Serpent Order!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This warrior had been silent since arriving, so much so that many had forgotten he was even there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected Malcolm to have secured such powerful backing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maxine, I told you before. You can't win against me. Yet, you refused to listen. Grab her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm's face was filled with gloating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he finished speaking, several black-clad men tried to move in to restrain Maxine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before they could reach her, a calm voice spoke up. It was Marcus, who had not said a word until now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Marcus positioned himself between Maxine and the approaching men, standing firm. Even facing the gun-wielding men and the warrior, his expression </span><span>remained unchanged, as if the situation didn't faze him at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His calmness left the crowd confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the face of Malcolm's overwhelming pressure, Maxine's family had reached the brink of life and death. They couldn't believe Marcus still dared to get involved. He was truly bold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have something to say? I advise you not to think just because you call yourself 'Death' that you can interfere in the affairs of the Burnett family. Stay out of it, and it's the only thing you should do!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm glared at Marcus, his tone dripping with sarcasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine shook her head vigorously, her eyes pleading with Marcus to stay out of it. She didn't want him dragged into this.</span></p></div>
