        <h1>Chapter 436 Bitter Mockery</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is my boyfriend, Marcus," Jane said, her voice somewhat strained and unnatural. Given their unique situation, she had no choice but to introduce him this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well, well, Jane. Even with your husband dead and the family business gone, you still managed to snag yourself a young boyfriend," Tracy sneered, her words dripping with sarcasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh, now it makes sense," Lucas chimed in with a cold laugh. "I was wondering why Jane hasn't been sending Dad any money this past year. Turns out she's been spending it all on her kept man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane's face darkened. After years away from home, she hadn't expected to be greeted with such cruel mockery from her siblings the moment she stepped out of the car. Their words left her heart feeling ice cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Lucas, you shouldn't just blurt it out. You need to show some consideration for Jane's feelings." Tracy smirked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lucas gave a slight nod. "Jane, I'm just a straight shooter. I say what's on my mind. Don't take it personally. You've come such a long way. Let's go inside before the food gets cold."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They all went into the house. The table was laden with a feast prepared for Simon's seventieth birthday. Everyone took their seats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After all these years and everything you've done for the family, they still don't seem to welcome you," Marcus murmured to Jane as he sat beside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane gave a bitter smile. "I only came back because it's Dad's seventieth birthday. If I didn't come now, the next time I see him might be at his funeral.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well, at least they haven't changed at all. I guess that helps me let go of any lingering hopes. Honey, I'm sorry you had to see this. Let's just finish our meal and head back to Solomia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus gave a slight nod. He could see clearly that Jane's father and siblings didn't treat her as family at all. With relatives like these, she was better off without them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So Jane," Tracy spoke up from across the table. "Your boyfriend looks quite young. He is probably even younger than me, though he is handsome. What does he do for a living? Tell us about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After all, in today's world, good looks alone won't put food on the table."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus runs a company in Solomia," Jane replied casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She deliberately omitted mentioning his position as Chairman of the Golden Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The reason was simple&mdash;she knew both her father and siblings were eyeing their money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Revealing too much would only cause problems for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Running a company? What kind of company? He doesn't look rich to me. Otherwise, why would he need to borrow your car?" Lucas said with a sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd taken an instant dislike to Marcus from the moment he walked through the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lucas scoffed, "Look, Jane, I'm saying this as your brother. You're in your thirties now. Instead of chasing after young guys, you should find someone powerful who can help support our family. What's the point of dating some pretty boy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you had skills like Tracy, it'd be different. Tracy's boyfriend is from Kingston, and both his parents are executives at Kingston listed companies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But unfortunately, Jane, you've got no degree, and you're not getting any younger. Sure, it might be hard to find someone like that, but you definitely can't bring home some broke guy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Lucas finished speaking, Tracy's expression turned smug. "Oh, Lucas, stop it. You'll give Jane a complex. Tristan's parents are business managers at Eastcomm Group. Together, they make several million dollars a year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Look at Jane's boyfriend. He's clearly just a pretty face who'll end up living off Jane. Comparing him to Tristan is downright insulting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane's expression darkened. "Can you two ever stop? I just got home, and you're already going at it non-stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You all mock and jab at me constantly. Do you really consider me family at all? And let me tell you something. Marcus is just as good as any of you. He wouldn't even look twice at a job that only pays a few million dollars a year."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At these words, Tracy, Lucas, and Tristan's faces all broke into sneering smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Come on, Jane," Lucas said. "Who else would we consider family if not you? As your siblings, we're just looking out for you. You're really misinterpreting our good intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You say he's not interested in a job with a million-dollar salary. Well, tell us. What exactly does he do? You're being so vague about it. It sounds like you're making it all up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Lucas, stop teasing Jane," Tracy chimed in with a laugh. "Her late husband was indeed quite wealthy, at least a third-rate Solomia family, living in a big villa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But since the old man's death, that family has been in decline. I certainly don't believe this pretty boy has any real money. And comparing him to Tristan? There's no comparison at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane couldn't hold back anymore. Taking a deep breath, she declared, "Marcus is the Chairman of Solomia Golden Group. Isn't that more impressive than someone making a few million dollars a year?"</span></p></div>
