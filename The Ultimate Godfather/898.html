        <h1>Chapter 863 Stop!-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus barely raised an eyebrow, showing zero interest in engaging with Cody.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, Cody wasn't even worth the dirt under his shoes, and he couldn't be bothered to fight him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a casual sidestep that looked effortless, Marcus dodged Cody's powerful punch like it was nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The motion was perfectly timed and executed with precise control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A split second later would have been too late to dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't lay a finger on me. Just give it up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said with a calm demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cody's face darkened as he felt Marcus was toying with him, making him lose face even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a furious roar, he swung his Fist Ray at Marcus again with devastating force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This punch seemed even more violent than the previous Fist Ray, reaching Marcus' back of the head in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus casually ducked his head again to dodge the punch, then stepped back beside Maxine and pointed at Cody, saying, "Strike one, strike two, but there won't be a strike three. You'd better watch yourself. We're leaving!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Marcus took Maxine's hand, ready to depart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not so fast, kid. You'll have to get through me first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cody's anger had wholly boiled over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He refused to let </span><span>Marcus walk</span><span> away so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that happened, he would ultimately lose his face&mdash;how could he show his face around the </span><span>Rowane</span><span> military district again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Cody could land his attack, Marcus felt a sudden surge of murderous intent behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This attack was aimed at Marcus' vital points, making it even more dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hit like that could have been lethal to any ordinary opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' brow furrowed as he sensed the killing intent radiating from Cody.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already given Cody two chances but wouldn't listen to reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the last straw! Marcus' patience finally snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Cody's Fist Ray could connect, Marcus spun around and caught Cody's wrist in an iron grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cody felt an overwhelming force lock around his wrist, bringing his Fist Ray to a dead stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attack hung suspended in mid-air, completely neutralized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' face remained perfectly calm, as if it had taken no effort to stop Cody's powerful punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cody's face turned ashen as he struggled desperately but futilely against Marcus' grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a casual flick of his wrist, Marcus sent Cody stumbling backward. He would have hit the ground if his companions hadn't caught him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers barely managed to catch Cody before he crashed to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spectators watched in stunned silence, their faces pale with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What terrified them most was how effortlessly Marcus had neutralized Cody's Fist Ray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew Cody's punch had enough power to injure an ordinary person seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that Marcus could stop it so casually spoke volumes about his true strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, well, you've got some fundamental skills there. Looks like I underestimated you before. Let's go another round!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cody flexed his wrist, clearly ready to take another swing at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could move, Maxine's icy voice cut through the air. "Marcus has shown you enough patience, Cody. You'd better quit while you're ahead, or you'll be the one getting hurt if this continues!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cody completely ignored Maxine's warning and still advanced toward Marcus with hostile intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop right there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could take another step, a commanding voice boomed from the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice carried the weight of age but resonated with undeniable authority, those two simple words commanding instant respect from everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All heads turned toward the source of the voice, where they spotted several figures in military uniforms making their way up the winding mountain road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man leading the group was pushing sixty. With two-star general insignia on his shoulders and silver-white hair, he emanated a compelling presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officers following him were all high-ranking, with the lowest ranking being full colonels. Two brigadier generals flanked his sides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in Kingston, people of this caliber were considered absolute top brass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These distinguished military leaders walked up the mountain road on foot, appearing before Marcus and the others.</span></p></div>
