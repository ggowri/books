  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his wife Helen daring to speak up again, Dexter was immediately enraged. He wanted to slap her across the face, but his hands were tightly bound. Still, the anger within him was unstoppable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without thinking, Dexter lunged Helen, biting down hard on her shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dammit, you stupid woman! If it weren't for you causing all this trouble, my cousin and I wouldn't be in this mess! Today, I'll bite you to death!" Dexter roared furiously as he sank his teeth into Helen's flesh with brutal force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The viciousness of the bite was relentless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A large chunk of flesh was torn from Helen's shoulder, and she screamed in agony like a wounded animal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Dexter, still not satisfied, bit down on another spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood oozed from the wound, staining his clothes red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dexter, you heartless bastard! How can you do this to me? No matter what, I'm your wife! This is domestic violence!" Helen cried out in pain, struggling wildly. She couldn't believe what was happening&mdash;Dexter, who had always been so obedient and doting, had suddenly lost control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene froze everyone around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected Dexter to snap like this. It was the first time they'd ever seen someone bite so violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen weighed over 200 pounds, and her flesh was thick. The bite had left a huge, gaping hole in her shoulder, from which blood poured out, creating a gruesome sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiera couldn't bear to watch anymore, her face pale with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seemingly noticing Kiera's reaction, Jareth quickly gave orders to the soldiers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take them away!" he commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The soldiers immediately complied, dragging Hank, Dexter, and Helen to the military vehicles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With high-ranking Uswad officials giving the orders, Hank's time as</span><span> the</span><span> City Governer</span><span> </span><span>was over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, under the stunned gaze of the crowd, </span><span>Ryker</span><span> and Jareth descended the ladder. With military precision, they walked toward Marcus and, without a word, saluted him. Their faces were filled with respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Commander </span><span>Ryker</span><span> </span><span>Zeller</span><span> and Deputy Commander Jareth Falkner from the Solace Military Division, at your service, Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Marcus raised an eyebrow, gesturing for them to relax.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no need for such formalities," Marcus said, smiling slightly. "Tell me, who exactly sent you to help me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was curious, as he had never informed the Uswad military about the situation. He had only contacted Amelia from City Hall's office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, after all, was just Benjamin's secretary and had no direct connection to the military.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was Lydia's personal assistant who notified us," </span><span>Ryker</span><span> answered with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Lydia's image popped into Marcus's mind, he couldn't help but wonder&mdash;how had she known he needed help? Was it possible she had somehow tracked his actions?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus shook off the thought and turned to </span><span>Ryker</span><span> and Jareth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't need any further assistance. You two should return now to avoid causing unnecessary panic among the public," he said, signaling that they could leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the entire neighborhood was surrounded by Solace Military Division soldiers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking around, there were easily several hundred fully armed soldiers, each holding heavy weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For ordinary civilians, this was undoubtedly an immense shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some residents of the neighborhood were even lingering outside, too afraid to return to their homes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Fitzgerald!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryker</span><span> gave Marcus a standard military salute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he was over fifty and a high-ranking military official, in front of Marcus, </span><span>Ryker</span><span> behaved with utmost respect, completely putting aside any airs of authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, if you ever need assistance in the future, just contact us directly. Solace Military Division will do everything in our power to serve you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jareth also spoke with deep respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man before them, no more than twenty-something, had become Uswad's Special Military Advisor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This position was equivalent to a military division commander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uswad's military had six main military districts&mdash;Veritas, Valebrook, Concord, Kingston, Ashwind, and Rowane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These districts were above the general military unit level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the regional military districts only represented the military power of a single territory. In terms of rank, commanders like </span><span>Ryker</span><span> were equivalent to regional governors or top administrative officials.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they were still subordinate to the commanders of the six major military districts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, as the Special Advisor to the Uswad military, held a position equal to that of a commander of the six districts, meaning his rank far exceeded </span><span>Ryker</span><span>'s.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why </span><span>Ryker</span><span> was so respectful toward Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright," Marcus nodded toward Jareth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, </span><span>Ryker</span><span> and Jareth bid Marcus farewell and left with their troops.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the armed police force also withdrew, deeply shaken by the events of the day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never imagined that the young man, barely older than them, was the renowned Special Advisor to Uswad's military.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the commander of the Solace Military Division had to treat him with such deference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it was because of offending the Special Military Advisor that Solomia's City Governer was taken away by military vehicles for questioning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of this completely upended everyone's understanding, and many began to rethink the significance of the position of Special Military Advisor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, I can't believe you're so powerful..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once everything had settled, Kiera's voice trembled as she spoke to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, Kiera thought she had a good grasp of Marcus and knew of his extraordinary wealth and status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she now realized that what she knew was just the tip of the iceberg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never imagined that Marcus was the legendary Special Military Advisor, a figure known throughout Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm still the same person, nothing to be surprised about. Just relax, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing how stiff Kiera looked, Marcus couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No... I'm just shocked," Kiera replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This place isn't fit for you anymore. The environment is poor, and it attracts the wrong kind of people. I'll arrange for you to move to a new place," Marcus said to Kiera.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Kiera had become his woman, Marcus wasn't about to let her stay in such a run-down neighborhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiera wanted to refuse, but seeing Marcus' firm expression, he added, "You don't get to refuse. Got it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The simple words carried an undeniable air of authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiera immediately shut her mouth, her posture shifting into one of meek submission, silently accepting whatever Marcus had in mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, Marcus received a call from Benjamin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, Hank's been arrested. On behalf of the people of Solomia, thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin's voice was filled with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had only been the mayor of Solomia for a few years but had always lived in Hank's shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Hank was older and rarely involved in day-to-day affairs, Benjamin knew all too well about his shady dealings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Hank was the City Governer, and Benjamin's authority couldn't rival his. He had to turn a blind eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Benjamin had long been dissatisfied with Hank, but his personal capabilities were limited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Hank had been arrested, Benjamin couldn't contain his joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had served as a dedicated and clean official for years, and now, with Hank gone, he was finally poised to take over as the true leader of Solomia.</span></p><div class="pagination">
