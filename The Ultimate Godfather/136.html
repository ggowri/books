  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Ricardo's death, Marcus thought that Roger would send other experts to kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he never expected that this period of time would be surprisingly peaceful. His life was not in the least disturbed, and everything seemed to be going well.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that meant more hidden dangers, and Marcus didn't dare to slack off at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He devoted himself to developing his influence and improving himself.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Fireball and Lightning practice had been raised to a higher level, and the power had become more formidable.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Timeless Warrior's Grimoire had also reached the minor completion stage of Ancient Martial Stage Two and was only one step away from the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His strength as a warrior also increased slightly, but it was still far from the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus discovered that since he had reached the Ancient Martial Stage Three, the rate of his cultivation had noticeably slowed several times.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the former rate, with a more abundant supply of resources, he might have achieved a breakthrough in cultivation.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When it came to stages four through nine, it would definitely be more challenging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, was not discouraged. During this time, he had begun to pay attention to the mysteries of alchemy.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By taking the elixir in Ricardo's Spatial Ring, he broke through to the Ancient Martial Stage Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The medicine was obviously much more potent than the herbs. If he desired to improve his cultivation rapidly, it was necessary to learn the art of alchemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On this day, Marcus, returning from Serpent's Coil to the Bayside Villa, found Diana busy in the living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She kept disassembling a black gun in her hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curious, Marcus stepped forward and asked, "Diana, is this gun broken? Why are you taking it apart?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana replied, "I want to modify the gun to make it more powerful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked, "How to modify it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the mini submachine gun Diana had used so often before. It was very good for short-range street fighting. In an open space, however, its range would be extremely limited.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If its range and projectile power could be extended, it would be a very lethal weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, wait a moment. I'll be done soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was very focused. She took out a thumb-sized magic crystal from her Spatial Ring, placed it on a part of the mini submachine gun that had already had a groove cut in it, and locked it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gun was then reassembled and fitted with a silencer.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, let's try it in the courtyard," Diana said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus followed her to the courtyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana raised her mini submachine gun and shot at a dead tree not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She intentionally did not fire rapidly, only two rounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of the silencer was heard, and two bullets hit the tree trunk accurately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the tree trunk was ablaze with a flame apparently unusual because of its magical power.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than three breaths, the 20-inch diameter of the trunk was burnt to ashes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is very powerful. You embedded a magic crystal in the gun, right?" Marcus asked in surprise. A bullet from an ordinary mini submachine gun would not even be enough to penetrate a tree trunk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's modification made the gun extremely lethal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two bullets were sufficient to reduce such a thick tree trunk to ashes, as powerful as the strength of a Stage One Wizard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, you guessed right."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana grinned proudly. She had been studying the modification of guns for a long time and finally succeeded today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As far as I know, the magic crystal is disposable. Although your gun is deadly, it seems that it can only explode that power once," Marcus said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana chuckled and shot at a wooden stake again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two more bullets landed, and the stake also burned to ashes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on? The bullets still have fire magic. How did you do it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At the beginning of the modification, I was also troubled by this problem. Later, through continuous research and attempts, and some ancient books, I finally found a way to use an ancient spell to seal the magic power in the magic crystal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In other words, the magic power in the crystal is released slowly instead of all at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This crystal is enough to supply the magic power for thousands of bullets. I can replace the crystal after firing a thousand bullets!" Diana explained in detail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was even more dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It shocked him that Diana could modify weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remembered her once saying, "I'm more than just a wizard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her statement actually had a hidden meaning, but he ignored it at that time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have used up all my magic crystals. Where can I get new ones?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Enough magic crystals and similar mini submachine guns could be transformed into a large number of powerful weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If numerous men were armed with them, they would form a legion of immense strength!&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Marcus had no idea where to get the magic crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, it's a magical crystal mine," Diana replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked, "Where are the magic crystal mines?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana pondered for a while and said, "The magic crystal mines are mainly distributed in the Weston Land, but there are also many in Uswad, such as the Kinton Mountains in the west, the Rolan Plateau, Souphriland, and so on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked, "These areas are indeed within Uswad, but how can I obtain the mining rights?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana replied, "Money talks. With enough capital, you can buy everything you want!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus understood immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Magic crystals were priceless, and the mines that could produce magic crystals must cost an astronomical amount of money!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus once again realized the role of money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he was now worth hundreds of billions of dollars, it was just a drop in the bucket compared to those truly top wealthy people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to earn sufficient money as quickly as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus and Diana returned to the villa, his phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was an unfamiliar number. He wanted to refuse the call, but his intuition told him that he needed to answer it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the call was connected, a cold but extremely pleasant voice came. "Is this Marcus? I'm Maxine. My application for a special bonus for you has been granted. You will need to come to our school to sign and receive it in person. Please come over when you have time!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
