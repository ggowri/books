  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And where were you when my father was building this empire? You were still in high school! You're nothing but a freeloader who's been eyeing this position since you came of age!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What disappoints me the most is that you even tried to harm Grandpa, your father, just to get this position! How could you stoop so low?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecilia's voice cracked with emotion as years of pent-up feelings poured out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Joel was her uncle, he was only eighteen years her senior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecilia was barely an adult at twenty, while Joel was pushing thirty-eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Cecilia pointed out, Joel was merely a child when his </span><span>brother built</span><span> McHale Pharmaceuticals Group into an empire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joel's playboy tendencies showed early. He became a father himself at fifteen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Cecilia could finish speaking, Joel's hand struck her face with brutal force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecilia's cheek immediately swelled and reddened as Joel snarled, "You insolent brat, how dare you spew such nonsense!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today is my inauguration ceremony, and no one can change my position as the family's leader, not even you. Take my advice and accept your fate quietly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you cooperate, you'll keep your status as the McHale family's eldest daughter, and I'll provide for you for life. But if you resist, you and that old man will meet your maker!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joel spoke these words in a low voice that only he and Cecilia could hear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecilia clenched her fists, her face contorted with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, Ms. McHale, I bet you never saw this coming. Remember back at </span><span>Solomia</span><span> when you slapped me because of this guy? Did you ever imagine you'd end up in this situation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna stepped forward, dressed in an extravagant evening gown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her flawless makeup transformed her into something straight out of a fairytale princess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to Cecilia's disheveled state, Luna radiated brilliance. Holding her head high, she looked down her nose at Cecilia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecilia's expression turned ice-cold as she gritted her teeth and said, "Luna, I always treated you like my sister. That's why I was tough on you sometimes. I never thought you'd hold such a grudge over one slap. I misjudged you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna let out a sneer and said, "Oh please, Ms. McHale, drop the act. Things have gone too far for your fake sincerity now. You've always seen me as nothing but a servant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, once Mr. McHale takes over as the family head, I'll treat you the same way! You'll be my servant from now on! Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert joined in the laughter, his voice dripping with mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze inadvertently fell on Marcus as he sneered, "Kid, did you ever imagine you'd end up in my clutches like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just you wait! I will make you pay dearly for what you did to me that day, and I'll return it tenfold!" Albert boasted arrogantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus remained completely unfazed by Albert's provocations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he was carefully assessing the situation, having already extended his spiritual senses throughout the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he had thoroughly scanned every person present in the banquet hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He did this to understand Joel's entire setup within the venue clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides the man with the ponytail, two other fifth-generation cyborgs were concealed in the shadows, and their combat abilities matched him perfectly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The older of the two likely possessed even greater strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Additionally, numerous snipers and cyborgs armed with heavy weapons were strategically positioned throughout the hidden areas of the banquet hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that Joel had made extensive preparations for this inauguration ceremony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the banquet hall appeared peaceful on the surface, it was charged with lethal </span><span>intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joel's forces were ready to eliminate Cecilia at the first sign of resistance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given Joel's current arrangement, if Marcus hadn't accompanied Cecilia today, no one could have challenged Joel's ascension to the leadership position of the McHale family.</span></p><div class="pagination">
