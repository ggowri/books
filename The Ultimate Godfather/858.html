  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, news of Gabriel and Nolan's deaths spread like wildfire across Kingston, shaking the entire city to its core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Watson family plunged into chaos. Gabriel's brothers wasted no time making their moves, each vying for control of the family empire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the stock value of Watson-owned enterprises took a nosedive, none more so than </span><span>SiliconWave</span><span> Technologies, the family's flagship company. Its shares plummeted below 50 </span><span>Uswadian</span><span> coins&mdash;a historic low since its inception.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>SiliconWave</span><span> Technologies wasn't just any corporation. It was one of </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> top semiconductor manufacturers, boasting cutting-edge technology that could rival even the global superpowers. At its peak, the company's stock had soared to 500 </span><span>Uswadian</span><span> coins per share. Now, it was worth less than a tenth of that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the tempting price, few dared to step in. The Watson family's internal power struggle made the situation too volatile. Investors feared that pouring money into the company would be like stepping into quicksand&mdash;impossible to escape. As a result, Watson-owned assets became untouchable and deemed too risky for acquisition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The infighting escalated rapidly. That very night, a violent clash broke out within the family, resulting in heavy casualties as factions battled for dominance. Then, when </span><span>SiliconWave</span><span> Technologies' stock hit rock bottom at 35 </span><span>Uswadian</span><span> coins per share, an enigmatic figure known as Death made his move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a staggering 350 billion </span><span>Uswadian</span><span> coins, he executed a full takeover of </span><span>SiliconWave</span><span> Technologies, making himself its sole owner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For those familiar with </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> business scene, Death was no stranger. He had previously acquired Sync Group and </span><span>Eastcomm</span><span> Group&mdash;two rising industry giants owned by Kingston's Brown family&mdash;along with Bayside Petroleum Company in </span><span>Solomia</span><span> and </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> largest entertainment conglomerate, Royal Entertainment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under his control, these companies had not only rebounded but flourished, their market values multiplying several times over. Each of his investments had been nothing short of genius, earning him the title of a legend in the </span><span>Uswad</span><span> business world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Death was now synonymous with unparalleled investment acumen, a name revered by all in the financial sphere. And now, in less than a month, he had struck again&mdash;securing </span><span>SiliconWave</span><span> Technologies for 350 billion </span><span>Uswadian</span><span> coins and officially entering the semiconductor industry. But he wasn't done yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the same day, he shelled out another 150 billion </span><span>Uswadian</span><span> coins to acquire </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span>, a major subsidiary of the Watson family, claiming full ownership. With a total of 500 billion </span><span>Uswadian</span><span> coins spent in two swift moves, Death had once again reshaped Kingston's business landscape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His latest acquisitions dominated headlines across </span><span>Uswad</span><span>, sparking heated discussions everywhere. Adding </span><span>SiliconWave</span><span> Technologies and </span><span>MedicaGenix</span><span> to his empire only strengthened Marcus' grip on Kingston's economy, further expanding his already formidable business empire. And all of this? Orchestrated remotely from Melina's villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After spending two more passionate nights with Melina, Marcus bid her farewell and prepared to visit Josie one last time before heading back to </span><span>Solomia</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, on his way to Josie's house, something unexpected happened. As his taxi passed by a high-end restaurant, a commotion at the entrance caught his attention. A group of men and women stood in a heated argument. And in the middle of it&mdash;Jade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a distance, Marcus could see her locked in a tense exchange with a tall man wearing glasses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their argument was intense, with the man clearly overpowering her in both tone and presence. He spoke loudly, and forcefully, and even reached out to grab her arm multiple times. Jade yanked her arm away repeatedly, but the man refused to back down.</span></p><div class="pagination">
