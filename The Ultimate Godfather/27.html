        <h1>Chapter 26 Team Up</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine had only been on the job for three months, and already she had landed a million-dollar commission deal and was promoted to sales manager.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It all felt surreal, like a dream she couldn't quite grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Wilson, congratulations!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was the first to offer his well wishes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine snapped back to reality. "I... I've only just started. I'm not sure I can handle this..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled, "You're more than capable. You've got the skills and the dedication. I believe in you&mdash;don't sell yourself short!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a reluctant nod, Catherine accepted the compliment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Emilia felt a prick of jealousy. She had been mocking Marcus, worried he might notice her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus hadn't glanced her way once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization stung, especially now that Catherine was stepping into a role Emilia had coveted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only she had been the one to welcome Marcus, she thought bitterly; maybe it would have been her in that manager's chair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was no point in dwelling on what-ifs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emilia knew she should count her blessings; not getting fired was a small victory in itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After this experience, Emilia vowed never to underestimate anyone again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Catherine's assistance, Marcus successfully signed the purchase agreement and became the proud owner of a Cedars Villas property.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier and his team wrapped up their business and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in his sleek Alphard luxury vehicle, Marcus handed the villa keys to Melinda. "Mom, this villa is officially ours! It's fully furnished and has already been aired out, so we can move in right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melinda's eyes sparkled with excitement as she took the keys, momentarily speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have a home now! Yay! You're the best, Marcus!" Nicole chimed in, her innocent joy lighting up the atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She linked her arm with Marcus and danced around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After helping Richard and his family settle in, Marcus departed from the Cedars Villas community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Solomia Orthopedic Hospital, Jackson arrived for treatment and spotted a familiar face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly signaled for Amy to push him over to greet Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Yannis, what brings you to the orthopedic ward?" Jackson asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix, who had previously suffered a broken arm at the hands of Marcus, turned to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hess, what happened to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson forced a smile. "Just got into a little scuffle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's eyes narrowed with curiosity. "Who had the guts to take a swing at you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Jackson was just a sales manager, the real estate industry was lucrative, and he had investments that made him financially solid&mdash;perhaps even more so than Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, despite their hierarchical relationship, they interacted as equals in private.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's not get into it. I not only got punched, but I also lost my job. Just my luck, right?" Jackson sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix listened intently as Jackson recounted the chaos at the sales office that day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Jackson described the mysterious Mr. Fitzgerald, Felix's expression shifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait a second. What does this Mr. Fitzgerald look like?" Felix asked, his interest piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson described him in detail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's eyes glinted with recognition. "That's definitely him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson furrowed his brow in confusion. "You know this Mr. Fitzgerald? Who is he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix didn't hold back. "Let me fill you in..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson and Amy were taken aback, processing the revelation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the anger simmered within Jackson; losing his job to Marcus only fueled his resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Yannis, if I'm not mistaken, you also got the boot from Marcus, right?" Jackson pressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's expression hardened. "Yeah, that loser cost me my position, too. But now I'm working for Mr. Davis. Even if Marcus is the chairman, I'm not worried! If you're looking for revenge, let's join forces and go to Mr. Davis together!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson's eyes lit up with determination as he nodded enthusiastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What can I do for you, Mr. Yannis? Just let me know!" Jackson offered, eager to prove himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix paused, deep in thought. Then he asked, "You mentioned earlier that Marcus brought his adoptive parents to Cedars Villas to buy a property, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson nodded in affirmation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know which villa he purchased?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Jackson spilled the details about Marcus' villa at Cedars Villas, sharing everything he knew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Brandon's "ticket" in mind, Felix managed a cold smirk. It seemed he had a plan of his own brewing in that calculating mind of his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving Cedars Villas, Marcus faced a wall of traffic that lasted three long hours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only later he discovered that a serious accident had occurred up ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time the roads cleared, it was already past nine in the evening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Driving through the vibrant streets of Solomia, Marcus rolled down his window, taking in the exhilarating sights and sounds of the nightlife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was now cruising along the city's famous entertainment district, where a hundred nightclubs and bars created an electrifying atmosphere filled with laughter and music.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he passed one particularly lavish nightclub, something caught his eye&mdash;a familiar figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Natalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked flushed and more than a little disheveled, dressed to the nines in a way that screamed attention. It was clear she'd had a few drinks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Marcus noticed two guys with bleached hair attempting to shove her into a sleek Mercedes van. Natalia was fighting back, clearly unwilling to go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, girl, Mr. Wallace's got his eyes on you. Don't make this harder than it needs to be!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of the thugs sneered, raising his hand as if to slap Natalia.</span></p></div>
