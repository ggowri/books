  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' presence here was a direct violation, an open challenge to the entire Tucker family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Gertie knew Marcus was incredibly powerful, she also knew that the Tucker family had three Grandmasters who were far beyond even him in strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' appearance here was like walking right into a trap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm here to get you out." Marcus' voice was unwavering, but his eyes hardened as he took in the sight of her beaten, broken form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her like this made his blood boil. The Tucker family had shown her no mercy, torturing her without any regard for her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't come, her fate would have been sealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Marcus' words, Gertie felt her heart flutter unexpectedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never imagined he would come all the way here to rescue her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In reality, the only bond between them was their past encounter, nothing more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie had always thought of Marcus as a man who would lose interest after one night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never expected that, when she found herself in danger, the first person to come for her would be the one she had despised all along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Tucker family has three powerful Grandmasters at Return Essence stage guarding it. You should leave now. I don't want to drag you into this," Gertie said, her voice filled with genuine concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her feelings of gratitude, she found herself not wanting to get Marcus involved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only days ago, she would have been eager to make him pay for all he'd done to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Yasser, observing from the side, sneered inwardly. He was now more convinced than ever that Gertie had thrown herself at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought in fury, "This vile woman actually cares for him? Pathetic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, wasn't fazed. With a calm smile, he replied, "Don't worry. They can't touch me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Tucker family has wronged my woman. From now on, they'll be wiped from the world of Ancient Martial Art in Uswad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words were simple, yet they carried such a force that Gertie's body involuntarily trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could he really have the strength to challenge all three Grandmasters of the Tucker family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to reject the idea, but a seed of doubt had already been planted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three Grandmasters were untouchable, all beyond the Acquired Return Essence Realm, having cultivated for centuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were among the strongest in the entire world of Ancient Martial Art of Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie thought, "Even if Marcus is powerful, he can't possibly stand up to them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could process this, Marcus' fingers flickered with Numinous Energy, effortlessly snapping the iron chains that bound her to the pillar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached into his Spatial Ring and pulled out two healing pills, precious treasures from powerful enemies at Return Essence stage he had slain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pills were renowned for their miraculous healing properties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He handed them to Gertie, and she, too exhausted to refuse, swallowed them without a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The instant the pills hit her stomach, a rush of warmth surged through her body, as if she were enveloped by a wave of healing energy. Her injuries began to mend almost immediately. Even the surface wounds on her skin started to heal before her very eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie's eyes widened in astonishment. She never imagined Marcus had access to such miraculous medicine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need to go, now," Marcus said, not giving her time to respond. He gently took her hand and led her towards the exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't look back at Yasser, who, seeing this, assumed Marcus had overlooked him. Panicking, he quickly triggered the family's emergency alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was no ordinary alarm. It was an emergency level that demanded the Grandmasters' immediate attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser was eager to see how Marcus would die. After all, no one who dared to infiltrate the Tucker family's dungeon would ever leave alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Gertie didn't struggle. She simply followed him, step by step, feeling an odd sense of safety she hadn't felt in a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't explain it, but at that moment, being with him felt right. For the first time, she felt protected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they emerged from the dungeon, the Tucker family's elite had already gathered outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them were Brett, the family patriarch, and several high-ranking members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three elderly men, exuding an aura of unmatched power, stood out among the crowd. Their presence was overwhelming, radiating an almost tangible energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all above Return Essence stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus could sense that these were the very Grandmasters who had been the pride of the Tucker family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser shouted, "Dad, this is the bastard who slept with Gertie! He killed our family's Four Guardians and now dares to break into the dungeon. We must tear him apart to make an example of him!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
