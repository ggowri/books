        <h1>Chapter 396 Huge Blow</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfred was panicked. He yelled at Scales, "Don't talk nonsense. I have never said such words to you. You are slandering me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What Scales said made Alfred feel uneasy. Alfred had indeed helped his several relatives join the company, and he had always kept it a secret. But he never thought that Scales would discover it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm slandering you? Alfred, you promised me before. How could you deny it?" Scales continued, thinking Alfred had deceived him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, before Scales could finish his words, Alfred slapped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Scales was slapped so hard that he shook and almost fell. He shook his head and roared, "How dare you slap me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You deserve it. Do you really think that by cooperating with Golden Group, you can ask me to do anything? I have seen many people like you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You claim to be related to Golden Group just because you have a small project with the company. Who do you think you are? You dare to make promises to others in my name. Bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This scene stunned the others present. Only then did they realize that Scales was not as powerful as Sheila had claimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Scales did know Alfred, but it was definitely not the case that he could ask Alfred to help him let some people join Golden Group easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfred continued, "I seemed to hear you insulting Mr. Fitzgerald before I entered the private room. You are really bold. Mr. Fitzgerald is someone that even Ms. Smith needs to respect. Without Mr. Fitzgerald, Ms. Smith would not be able to become the head of Golden Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How dare you mock Mr. Fitzgerald? You are insulting Golden Group. You are actually dreaming of asking me to let some people join Golden Group!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfred's voice was chilling. He knew very well about Marcus' position in Golden Group. Marcus was someone that even Michelle had to respect. He was the real boss of Golden Group behind the scenes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, those people dared ridicule Marcus. Alfred really wanted to beat them up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfred's words stunned everyone. They stared at Marcus in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald is someone that even Ms. Smith needs to respect. Without Mr. Fitzgerald's appointment, Ms. Smith would not be able to become the head of Golden Group!" These words echoed in everyone's mind, making them tremble all over uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They looked at Marcus in shock. Those who had just questioned Marcus felt a chill creep over them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sheila asked in a trembling voice, "Mr. Hershey, are you mistaken? Marcus is the boyfriend of my old classmate. He is a loser who drives a cheap car. How could he be someone that even Ms. Smith needs to show respect to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Sheila finished her words, Alfred yelled at her, "Shut up! How dare you insult Mr. Fitzgerald? If you dare to say it again, you'll be doomed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Scales and Baily's hearts were pounding, and they thought they had heard it wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of what they had just said to ridicule Marcus, they were panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus was really the owner of Golden Group, the real boss behind the scenes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus was willing to have dinner with those people, but they kept ridiculing him. They were really stupid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those who had just fantasized about asking Scales to help them get a job at Golden Group were full of regrets. The real big shot was right before them, but they were unaware of it and flattered Scales. They didn't know that Scales was nothing in front of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfred called Michelle and reported respectfully, "Ms. Smith, Mr. Fitzgerald has been insulted by Scales at Kirkland Hotel. If I hadn't arrived in time, those people would have been even more unscrupulous. Ms. Smith, please terminate the cooperation with Scales to prevent him from using the name of Golden Group to deceive others!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Okay, I see, Ms. Smith. I will listen to Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hanging up the phone, Alfred said to Scales, "Scales, Ms. Smith has decided to terminate the cooperation with you. From now on, you have nothing to do with Golden Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Upon hearing this, Scales collapsed. He never dreamed that he would end up in such a miserable situation because he had offended Marcus. Losing the cooperation with Golden Group was a huge blow to him.</span></p></div>
