Marcus snapped back at Asher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher raised an eyebrow and smirked, "I didn't expect you to have such a sharp tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"To deal with a junior like you, I don't need to act personally. These two are more than enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before he finished speaking, the two Ancient Martial Stage Four experts beside him moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They immediately appeared before Marcus and unleashed terrifying fist strikes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The force of their blows, containing the unique power of Ancient Martial Stage Four, shook the air, and a menacing aura crashed down on Marcus' body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Narrowing his eyes, Marcus quickly dodged to the side to evade the attacks while throwing a punch at one of the attackers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His punch was fierce, infused with Thunderfire Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two men were caught off guard by Marcus' speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of them roared and attempted to counter with his fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sound of rumbling shocks spread out, and the power of destruction spread in all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man believed Marcus' cultivation matched his own, and they all advanced to Ancient Martial Stage Four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As their fists met, he realized he had underestimated Marcus' strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though Marcus' punch seemed ordinary, it held immense destructive power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The impact left him trembling and his arms numb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And this was just the beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before he could pull back, a surge of Thunderfire Power erupted from Marcus' fist, wrapping around his arm in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under the strong burning sensation, he felt severe pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Screaming in agony, he tried to extinguish the flames, but it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Thunderfire Power consumed his arm, burning it to ashes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your cultivation has reached the minor completion stage of Ancient Martial Stage Four! You're not just any warrior. You wield magical power!" the man gasped in horror and clutched his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ignoring him, Marcus stepped forward, delivering a powerful palm strike aimed at that man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The speed of his attack was blinding and left the man no time to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luckily, his companion released an attack to intercept Marcus' handprint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Both of you, attack together and kill him!" commanded Asher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two men nodded and unleashed their energy to overwhelm Marcus with destructive force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But before their strikes could land, a brilliant golden light erupted in front of Marcus!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The dazzling light swiftly severed the throat of one Ancient Martial Stage Four warrior and showered the area in blood!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That man stood frozen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked around and found Marcus wielded a golden scimitar whose blade was still dripping red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then he lost his consciousness and collapsed on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this the strength of the Astral Serpent Order? Two against one, and you're still no match for me. You're pathetically weak!" Marcus taunted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher's expression darkened. He hadn't anticipated Marcus' strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're forcing my hand!" he shouted, vanishing from sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, he reappeared before Marcus, unleashing a massive hand from above, intent on crushing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus activated the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire to its fullest and swung his golden scimitar upward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The scimitar possessed immense destructive power and struck Asher's large hand.
