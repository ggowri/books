  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Worried, Truman asked Giles nearby, "Mr. Hansen, what do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Giles narrowed his eyes. "Don't worry, Mr. Dupont. The essence of this stone lies in the middle part, where the energy crystal appears light purple, about the size of a basketball, and is worth at least 50 billion dollars. I have been in the gambling stone industry for many years, and I'm confident in this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing what Giles said, Truman finally felt relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the chainsaw went deeper, a faint purple light flashed out of the saw's edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The light purple luster shined brightly and released powerful energy fluctuations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hansen deserves to be the top master of gambling stones, and it was guessed by him. It seems that Mr. Dupont's stone is very valuable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Hansen is truly exceptional in strength. People in our position can't invite him even if we spend money. His prediction accuracy is over 80%, which is not comparable to some people who rely on luck! "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many people were whispering and shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Dupont, congratulations!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before the stone was fully cut, Camila congratulated Truman in advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tuman smiled at her, "It's no big deal. But I still want to thank you for your constant support."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Camila smiled sweetly at Truman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the two chatted, his stone was cut open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As predicted by Giles, the crystal appeared light purple, the size of a basketball, and the energy fluctuations that were released no less than Marcus'!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is so awesome! Mr. Hansen is really great!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hansen is indeed excellent, and you have to admit that Mr. Dupont has a keen eye. At first, Mr. Dupont did not rely on Mr. Hansen and chose this stone material himself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing everyone's praise, Truman felt greatly satisfied with his vanity and couldn't help but raise his chin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But when he glanced at Marcus, he was somewhat proud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus earned only 20 billion dollars from a stone. But his stone was worth at least 50 billion dollars, and his net profit was 30 billion dollars!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, he was still ahead of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, two stone cutters were ready to help Truman divide the energy crystal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was more convenient to carry and use this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There are cracks in the middle of the stone. We cannot divide it. One cut and the stone will shatter and become worthless. You two should think twice before you do it." Marcus' voice came before the two stone cutters began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although it had nothing to do with Marcus, he couldn't bear to see such a large piece of energy crystal about to shatter, so he spoke up to remind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Pauper, what are you talking about? How can you talk about this? Stop spouting nonsense here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How can we use such a good energy crystal if we don't divide it? You're just jealous of Mr. Dupont, so you're talking nonsense about cracks inside the crystal. Do you really think you have superpowers or what?" Camila mocked Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jennifer chimed in, "Yeah, Marcus is just talking nonsense. Mr. Dupont, don't listen to him. If there were cracks in the crystal, wouldn't Mr. Hansen have seen it coming?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Truman was relatively cautious. Instead of denying Marcus' words, he asked Giles, "What do you think, Mr. Hansen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Giles sneered, "Mr. Dupont, there's no need to listen to idle people. As she said, if there were cracks in the crystal, I would have informed you long ago!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Truman cast an ironic look at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Keep cutting, regardless of what others say!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the two stone cutters got permission, they began to cut the energy crystal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, as soon as the chainsaw came into contact with the energy crystal, cracks appeared on its surface to everyone's shock!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, these cracks spread at a visible speed and soon enveloped the entire energy crystal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, a loud explosion sounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This light purple energy crystal shattered and turned into small fragments that scattered on the ground!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone present was completely stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That young man was right. The energy crystal did explode! Why is that young man so amazing? Is he also a master of stone gambling!?" Someone exclaimed among the crowd.</span></p><div class="pagination">
