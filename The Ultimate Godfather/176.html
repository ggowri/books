        <h1>Chapter 175 Aiton Hudson</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After handling everything, Marcus quietly left the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The drug he had injected into Pete was a euthanasia agent, and the dosage was far beyond what would be needed for a normal patient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Pete had already met his maker, but not a single one had noticed a thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pete's subordinate had been waiting in the hospital corridor. It wasn't until 11 p.m. that he began to sense something was wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under normal circumstances, Pete would have already been asking for his dinner by this time. However, today, there had been strangely quiet tonight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked into the room and found Pete lying under the blanket, his head covered. Instinctively, this man lifted the blanket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he saw made his blood run cold. Pete was frozen, his eyes vacant, his skin ashen, devoid of any color!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hudson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trembling, the man placed his hand under Pete's nose, his face turning pale in horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hudson! Mr. Hudson! What happened to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Doctor, quick, come! Mr. Hudson's not breathing! Please, come now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He screamed as he ran out of the room, desperately calling for a doctor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pete was the legitimate heir of the Hudson family. If he were to die like this, his subordinate would face the most severe punishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, several doctors in white coats rushed into the room, performing a series of emergency procedures, but it was all for naught!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pete was dead, beyond any hope of revival. No one could save him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pete was declared dead, and the cause of death was pending further investigation by the coroner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within moments, the whole hospital was in an uproar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The police were soon involved, launching an extensive investigation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was then they discovered that at 8:35 p.m., a person in a white coat had entered Pete's room and left at 8:40 p.m.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This person became the prime suspect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the individual had been wearing a hat and mask. Even with the security footage set to the highest clarity, the police couldn't confirm that man's identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The police tried to pull fingerprints, but the professionalism of the intruder was astounding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nothing had been left behind, not a single fingerprint. The investigation was at a standstill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>News of the incident soon reached the upper echelons of Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin frowned deeply. He hadn't expected Pete to die in the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Benjamin had always disliked Pete, the fact that he, as a direct descendant of the Hudson family, had died mysteriously in Solomia Hospital would undoubtedly bring diplomatic pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had long since changed out of his hospital attire. He was now driving his Aston Martin along the highway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He arrived at a remote area and used his Fireball, consuming his previous clothing and equipment in flames, reducing everything to ash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that Marcus feared being discovered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just thought it would be more interesting for Pete to die without anyone knowing the true cause.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Eldoria, at the Hudson family estate, in a room resplendent with grandeur, a tall, broad-shouldered, middle-aged man with blonde hair and blue eyes stood holding a report, his hands trembling uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who did this? Who was responsible? I want this solved now! Find the killer, and I'll tear them apart!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man roared with fury, his presence radiating a murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His name was Aiton Hudson. He was Pete's father and the head of the Hudson family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had two sons and a daughter. His youngest son, Pete, despite his reckless and arrogant personality, had always been his favorite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could not stand the thought of his son dying in such a mysterious and unjust way. He swore that the person responsible would pay and pay dearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Solomia's government office, in the mayor's office, Benjamin sat lost in thought, processing the news of Pete's sudden death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the phone rang urgently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Benjamin was about to hang up, he saw that it was his wife calling. He hurriedly answered, "What's wrong? Is it Grace?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin's voice was tight with concern, clearly anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grace's fifth blood transfusion failed... She's in severe shock and unconscious. The doctor... the doctor said... oh no..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice on the other end was that of a middle-aged woman. She began sobbing uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me what the doctor said! You're going to kill me with worry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin's voice grew more frantic as he became increasingly desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The doctor said Grace only has two or three days left... This time, they can't save her... Benjamin, you have to come to Kingston! Please, come see Grace one last time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman's voice broke as she continued, the atmosphere thick with despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin's face turned pale, his phone slipping from his hand and hitting the ground...</span></p></div>
