  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time he was seeing her perfect body laid out on a bed in a room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was instantly captivated by the sight, like gazing upon a work of art.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every part of Ada's body seemed perfectly sculpted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her skin was so pale and smooth that it looked like it could practically glow. Her full, round breasts were incredibly enticing, perfectly shaped with no hint of sagging&mdash;firm, with a fantastic, bouncy feel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her areolas were a delicate pink, just the right size and shape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her flat stomach and slender waist, free of any excess fat, added to her undeniable allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lower down, her dark, slightly sparse pubic hair was visible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the lamp's light, the mysterious cleft within was clearly defined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps due to Marcus' earlier teasing, a subtle sheen of moisture glistened there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear Ada was aroused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop staring," Ada whispered, her face burning. "I'm so embarrassed..." Seeing Marcus' intense gaze fixed on her, her heart pounded in her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her looking so flushed and desirable, Marcus couldn't hold back any longer. He leaned down and kissed her, his lips meeting hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A jolt of electricity shot through Ada. The sensation of his lips on hers sent her mind reeling, and she let out soft, breathy moans. Marcus' tongue slipped past her teeth, eagerly exploring the sweetness inside her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Marcus' relentless teasing, Ada was completely lost in the moment. Her soft moans grew more and more seductive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her skin flushed a deep crimson, and down below, she was slick with desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' hand slid down her stomach, soon finding its way to her already soaked and sensitive core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was warm and incredibly wet; even the slightest touch elicited a responsive twitch from within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada's breath hitched with each touch of his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes, filled with a mix of longing and exasperation, met Marcus'. "Marcus," she whispered, her voice husky, "why are you so damn bad? I tell myself I don't want this, but every time we're together, I end up giving in... Why does this keep happening?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus grinned, a playful glint in his eyes. "It just proves I've got that irresistible charm," he teased. "You're so hooked on </span><span>me,</span><span> you can't help but surrender."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada rolled her eyes at his cocky response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't believe how thick-skinned he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But deep down, she knew there was some truth to what he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forget about the fact that he forced her into a physical relationship&mdash;Marcus was, without a doubt, an exceptional man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From his looks to his skills, his presence, his values&mdash;everything about him made him the best Ada had ever seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man like Marcus, so talented and confident, who could resist him? Even his more domineering moments had Ada completely captivated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Ada started to wonder if maybe she had really fallen for Marcus. After all, she wouldn't have let him get away with things over and over again if she didn't care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But inside, she was torn. She hated to admit it, especially since he had forced himself on her, but deep down, she couldn't deny it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She liked Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a few days without seeing him, she couldn't stop thinking about him. When he was in danger, she'd find herself genuinely worried for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She even found herself willing to sacrifice her own safety to protect him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasn't that what it meant to really care for someone? To feel like this, to be this connected?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As these thoughts swirled through Ada's mind, Marcus launched into a fresh wave of passion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hand plunged into her already slick and swollen center, moving back and forth with increasing urgency.</span></p><div class="pagination">
