        <h1>Chapter 309 Recover</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade found it unbelievable and rushed to examine the middle-aged woman's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade found that the blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing rate of the severely shocked and dying patient had miraculously returned to normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the deputy chief physician of surgery in Solariae Hospital, Jade had rich clinical experience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had been exposed to too many patients with severe appendicitis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if these patients had their appendix removed, it would take several days for them to recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The middle-aged woman had been in critical condition, dying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now, she had miraculously recovered!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made Jade even think she was dreaming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She asked in a trembling voice, looking at Marcus, "Excuse me, which hospital are you from? What's your name?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus glanced at Jade and said, "Don't you know it's rude to ask people for their personal information?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Marcus returned to his seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Marcus' back, Jade didn't leave immediately. Instead, she said to the middle-aged woman and the boy, "Although you feel good now, I suggest you go to the hospital for further examination. I am the deputy chief physician of surgery at Solariae Hospital. Come with me later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The middle-aged woman and her son immediately nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was dying just now and would have to be checked out to avoid her worries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade also returned to her seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked at Marcus from time to time, but Marcus kept his eyes closed and paid no attention to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I was wrong about you just now. I apologize. Please answer the question I asked just now. Thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade couldn't help it, apologized, and asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was quite persistent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't open his eyes but simply replied, "I don't care whether you apologize or not, because I have nothing to do with you. As for your questions, I will answer them now. I have no medical qualifications, and I don't belong to any hospital. "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he continued to repose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade was angry and thought he was vindictive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought Marcus must be angry because she had wrongly blamed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade didn't believe he was not a doctor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, the medical system was so mature that it was difficult for ordinary people to teach themselves medicine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was even less likely to treat a severely shocked patient with appendicitis perforation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was difficult for even some specialists to treat such patients without the help of any medical equipment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But it only took Marcus five minutes to get all the indexes of the patients back to normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade didn't believe his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Half an hour later, the train stopped at Solariae's railway station.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus got out of the car alone and got into a taxi to find a hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade contacted the hospital vehicle in advance and went directly to Solariae Hospital with the middle-aged woman and the boy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She quickly launched a series of examinations for the woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade was waiting outside the color ultrasound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, a doctor came out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade asked, "Does the patient still need surgery?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Jade's view, even if Marcus awakened the woman, it was only temporary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, with the current medical means, the treatment of appendicitis perforation could only be surgery. There was no other way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jade, are you mistaken? There is nothing wrong with the patient's appendix. She's fine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The doctor said so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade asked, her eyes wide in surprise, "No way. I took a train with this patient. She was in severe shock in the carriage. At that time, I was sure that she was caused by appendicitis perforation. How could there be no problem with her appendix?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The doctor said, "You can check it out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade nodded, walked quickly to the front of the screen of the color ultrasound instrument and operated the color ultrasound to further examine the middle-aged woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Why? Her appendix has completely recovered. What means did he use? "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at the screen, Jade had a lot on her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was worried that the woman would not want to come to the hospital for a check-up, so Jade came with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If the middle-aged woman's appendicitis was not cured, she would be in danger again soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, her appendix miraculously recovered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade knew that this was most likely done by Marcus!</span></p></div>
