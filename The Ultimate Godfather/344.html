  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's your husband's name? And who appointed him as General Manager?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' gaze narrowed slightly as he stared at the smug woman before him, his voice calm but probing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Victoria answered, "Of course, it was Stephen Andrade. Who else would have the authority?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She paused, then smirked. "But honestly, why am I even explaining this to you? Someone like you wouldn't understand. After all, Mr. Andrade isn't someone you're ever going to get close to."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' brows furrowed, his tone becoming even more indifferent. "Tell your husband to come here to see me in five minutes. Make it quick."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent for a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victoria, Gloria, and everyone else present stared at Marcus, bewildered by his audacity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victoria and Gloria both broke into mocking laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Catherine, is this guy for real? He actually thinks Leif's going to come to see him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does he have rocks in his head or something, spouting off such nonsense?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leif's the General Manager of Sync Group Solomia. He's a big deal. His schedule is packed. Why would he waste his time meeting with someone like him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he's losing it, he should get checked into a psychiatric hospital. He's only embarrassing himself here," Gloria added with a look of utter contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although both Gloria and Victoria's arrogance was grating, most of the onlookers shared their disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was acting as though the General Manager of the branch was one of his subordinates, someone he could summon at will.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he truly had such high status, why would he have brought his friend here for an interview in the first place?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could have just arranged a job for her directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most people, including Catherine, looked at Marcus in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine leaned in and whispered, "Marcus, Sync Group is a massive conglomerate based in Kingston. They don't even belong to Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know you're well-connected here, but this is a different world. Don't get into trouble with them. If your actions cause problems for Golden Group, I'll feel guilty for the rest of my life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave her a reassuring look, silently telling her not to worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gloria, you're right. This guy seems perfectly normal on the outside, but he's probably got some screws loose. Why else would he spout such ridiculous claims?" Victoria sneered, her eyes full of disdain as she regarded Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Victoria, just call security and have this guy thrown out. He's making a fool of himself and damaging our company's image," one of the interviewers suggested, his voice laced with sycophantic undertones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear he was eager to please Victoria, knowing her husband was the branch's General Manager.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Security! Where are the guards? Get this crazy guy out of here!" Gloria shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, paid no attention to the mockery or the commotion around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calmly, he dialed Stephen's number, his voice steady and assertive, "Get Leif, the General Manager of Sync Group Solomia, to come here to meet me in five minutes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephen had no idea what was happening, but without hesitation, he accepted the request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Marcus hung up, a ripple of shock spread through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many of the attendees couldn't help but scoff at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, a few security guards quickly approached, clearly intent on escorting Marcus and Catherine out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Victoria, with a glint of curiosity in her eyes, waved them off. "Let them be. I'm curious to see how this guy thinks he can get my husband to come here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gloria snickered. "You're right. If Leif isn't here in five minutes, we'll throw him out ourselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was now filled with a sense of anticipation, though most didn't truly believe anything would come of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leif, after all, was a big fish&mdash;one of the top executives in Sync Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The idea that a random young man could summon him with a single phone call seemed utterly absurd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine's face was filled with worry as she watched Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was about to speak up, but hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they ended up being ridiculed by Gloria and the others, so be it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least they would be able to move on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wouldn't cost her anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, her thoughts wandered to what job she might need to look for next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before five minutes had even passed, the doors to the building swung open, and a group of people rushed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the front of the pack was a middle-aged man in a sharp suit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He exuded an aura of authority, and his confident strides made it clear that he held significant power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, as he walked, there was an unmistakable urgency in his movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was none other than Leif Leonard, the General Manager of Sync Group Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight immediately caught the attention of everyone in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victoria and Gloria froze for a moment, their expressions briefly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Victoria, Leif really came... What's going on?" Gloria felt a sudden, unsettling sense of dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Relax, it's probably just a coincidence. I'm sure he's here to inspect the interview process," Victoria said quickly, though the doubt in her eyes lingered.</span></p><div class="pagination">
