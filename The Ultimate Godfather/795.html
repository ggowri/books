        <h1>Chapter 786 Julian Ashford-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This gave the Serpent's Coil members a much-needed boost to sharpen their skills and elevate their combat prowess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the addition of those 500 energy crystal guns, the organization's power skyrocketed to a whole new level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus figured that, by now, Serpent's Coil could be ranked as a mid-tier faction in what the world of Ancient Martial Art would call the hierarchy of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A force like this could even go toe-to-toe with some of the modern, cutting-edge military units.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite this success, Marcus made it crystal clear to everyone in Serpent's Coil&mdash;keep your heads down and no unnecessary showing off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Marcus understood this strange new world he lived in, the more he realized how small he truly was in the grand scheme of things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still hadn't managed to reach the Return Essence stage. If he crossed paths with someone at the pinnacle of that stage, all the strength he had painstakingly built would crumble like sand in a storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a master of that caliber, annihilating a group like Serpent's Coil would be as simple as snapping their fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only sensible strategy was to grow quietly, like a tree taking root in the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To make matters worse, Marcus was under the constant watch of his two older brothers, whom he had yet to meet face-to-face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Serpent's Coil made too much noise, it'd be like waving a red flag in front of a bull&mdash;they'd be asking for trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had no intention of letting that happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After handling those affairs, he stopped by Golden Group and Pharmaceutical Industrial Park to check in on how things were progressing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to the tireless efforts of Michelle and Yvonne, both businesses were thriving and operating like well-oiled machines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The earlier logistics issues had been ironed out, thanks to Darian's logistics company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owning a dedicated logistics operation solved countless problems that had previously hampered their growth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No more dealing with the whims of third-party logistics providers!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following the chaos of the earlier public listing debacle, Darian's company had finally found its groove.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He brought in a slew of highly educated professionals to help manage operations, and the results spoke for themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With backing from Golden Group and Pharmaceutical Industrial Park, Darian's logistics business grew at breakneck speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was carving out a reputation as a rising star in the national logistics scene, fast becoming a household name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Marcus took a detour to the </span><span>Solomia</span><span> branch of Sync Group to catch up with Catherine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over time, Catherine had truly found her footing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The branch was running like clockwork, with a steady surge in business growth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chad's sales company was also making impressive strides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a team of sharp, professional managers handpicked by Marcus, Chad was practically sitting on a goldmine without lifting a finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't have to stress over the day-to-day grind; everything was handled for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus simply shrugged at the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chad was more than just an old buddy from his school days&mdash;they had shared experiences that forged a brother-like bond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Setting up the sales company wasn't about profit; it was about giving Chad a purpose, a way to stay busy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether the business made bank or not? Marcus couldn't care less.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long, bustling day, Marcus decided to head back to Bayside Villa to focus on his cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he approached his usual route in the afternoon, he was stopped short&mdash;it had been completely sealed off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Police cars lined both sides of the road, and SWAT officers stood at the ready, weapons in hand, stationed every few yards in a no-nonsense lockdown.</span></p></div>
