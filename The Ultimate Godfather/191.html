If there is a next time, your fate will be even more miserable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lester and Troy felt relieved and thanked him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina and a dozen other girls were all stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did they realize that they had looked down on Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Troy, with the Burnett family's support, what are you afraid of? Don't you want to deal with this country bumpkin?" Harvey asked with a grim expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Troy glanced at Lester, who glared at him fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Troy replied, "Mr. Burnett, I am powerless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lester came up to Marcus and reminded him carefully in a low voice, "Mr. Fitzgerald, Harvey is from the Burnett family in Kingston. Do you want to avoid him? If there is a fierce conflict with the Burnett family, it might get you into trouble..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked at Lester and asked, "Are you questioning me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I dare not."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold sweat broke out on Lester's forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was worried about Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Lester's mind, though very powerful, Marcus was inferior to the Burnett family in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I see. Troy, I misjudged you. Today, I will show you how I kill this guy!" Harvey sneered repeatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He made a phone call. After hanging up, he said to Marcus coldly, "You country bumpkin, weren't you just warning Lester not to doubt your ability? If you have the guts, don't leave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harvey was confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, still sitting on the chair, stared strangely at Harvey and asked, "When did I say I was leaving?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harvey sneered, "That's great, but you will definitely regret your decision!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia, Melina, and the other girls became worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew that as a member of the Burnett family in Kingston, Harvey would definitely not let it over today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, there would be a more miserable scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Lester and Troy were respectful to Marcus, he was definitely not as influential as the Burnett family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than five minutes, everyone heard a burst of urgent sirens coming from far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, many fully armed SWAT vehicles sped over quickly, and hundreds of SWAT officers got out of them and surrounded Harvey's villa!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here they are!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the noisy footsteps outside, everyone instantly became nervous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They understood that this was Harvey's strongest revenge and that Marcus would likely suffer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the door of the villa was pushed open, and more than a dozen SWAT officers rushed in quickly with rifles in hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader was tall and in his early 30s, but he already had the rank of colonel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He exuded an extremely strong aura of majesty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A girl exclaimed, "Harvey is indeed part of the Burnett family. He can even mobilize the SWAT team. Marcus is doomed..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Lester and Troy were frightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not everyone could mobilize SWAT officers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were at least hundreds of people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader was Logan Wilde, deputy captain of the Kingston SWAT Team!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Logan Wilde, you are finally here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Logan and his men arrived, Harvey immediately stepped forward to greet them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan nodded to Harvey, exuding a cold aura. "Where is the terrorist that you mentioned, Mr. Burnett?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harvey pointed at Marcus and explained through gritted teeth, "It was this damn guy who caused trouble and killed someone in my villa. Mr. Logan Wilde, please bring him to justice!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan's gaze fell on Marcus, and then his eyes widened in amazement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In order to make sure he was not mistaken, he took a few steps forward and asked excitedly, "Excuse me, are you Marcus Fitzgerald?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded calmly. "Do you know me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I have heard of you from my father and have always admired you. Now that I have met you, you are indeed an extraordinary young man!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan saluted Marcus respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Logan know Marcus, too?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who was this guy? Even an aloof officer like Logan treated him with respect...</span></p><div class="pagination">
