  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert glanced at Marcus sitting beside Jade and deliberately asked with a slightly sarcastic tone, "Jade, could you please introduce the gentleman next to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade responded, "This is my boyfriend, Marcus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Albert was momentarily stunned and then appeared visibly upset. However, he swiftly regained his composure and said with a smile, "I must say, Jade, you have quite an eclectic taste. I pursued you for two years, yet you never turned to me. Nevertheless, I'm delighted to see that you've found a partner. I just want to know what makes this guy superior to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade replied coolly, "Albert, let's not dwell on the past, shall we? You're not inferior to Marcus, but in my heart, Marcus is simply the best."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert smiled nonchalantly and remarked, "You're absolutely right; let's leave the past behind. After all, today is your birthday, so I prepared a gift for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Albert clapped his hands, and several charming waiters promptly entered the room. Leading the group was a waiter carrying a tray adorned with an exquisite gift box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert rose to his feet, retrieved the gift box, and opened it to reveal a dazzling diamond ring, a symbol of friendship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This diamond ring was not sourced from an ordinary luxury boutique but was meticulously handmade. Its craftsmanship was unmistakably the work of an internationally renowned jeweler. Under the light, it sparkled with mesmerizing brilliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon witnessing this ring, everyone present couldn't help but gasp, particularly the women, who cast envious glances at Jade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This diamond ring is exquisite beyond words, the most stunning one I've ever laid eyes on. Judging by its appearance, it must be priced at least at 100 thousand dollars!" exclaimed one woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're underestimating its value," another corrected. "The labor cost alone for this diamond, excluding materials, exceeds the number you just mentioned. The packaging looks familiar; it must be from Solomia's elite jewelry customization store. This store has gained immense popularity recently due to Tears of the Angel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't believe Albert gifted Jade such an exquisite piece from this prestigious store. How incredibly generous!" whispered a few girls among themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The popularity of that Solomia's jewelry customization store soared because of Tears of the Angel, driving up the prices of its other offerings. Albert had spent 280 thousand dollars on this ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he didn't mind the expense, as he intended to make a grand display today. Therefore, he had to ensure it was unforgettable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jade, happy birthday. Please don't misunderstand; this ring signifies friendship and also serves as a testament to our four years of university camaraderie. I sincerely hope you'll accept it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert said as he picked up the ring and approached Jade, presenting it to her with both hands. Meanwhile, he casually glanced at Marcus, seemingly curious about the gift he had prepared for Jade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given Albert's elaborate gesture, Jade had no choice but to accept the ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert then clapped his hands again and several more waiters carrying trays entered the private room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gift box on this tray was unmistakably more exquisite and breathtaking than the diamond ring he had given Jade earlier, immediately capturing everyone's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert announced, "Today is also my girlfriend Luna's birthday. As her boyfriend, I prepared a birthday gift for her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Albert retrieved the gift box from the tray and opened it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mesmerizing sapphire blue glow emanated from within, illuminating the entire private room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a sapphire necklace, its craftsmanship so exquisite that everyone present marveled at its beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the women present couldn't tear their eyes away from this necklace; it was simply too stunning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it Angel's Kiss?" inquired one woman in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert proudly nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Albert is so incredibly generous. Angel's Kiss is priced at 5.88 million dollars. It's rumored to utilize the same sapphire as Tears of the Angel and boasts equally impeccable craftsmanship. Since Tears of the Angel gained popularity, Angel's Kiss has garnered attention from celebrities worldwide, becoming a perfect alternative. Albert gifted Luna Angel's Kiss; he truly adores her!" exclaimed another woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, if I had a boyfriend like Albert, I'd be head over heels in love with him forever!" added one of Jade's female classmates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several female classmates engaged in animated chatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before today, most of them had only seen pictures and videos of Angel's Kiss online.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even through these mediums, they could appreciate its dazzling brilliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that they had seen it in person, they found its radiant beauty even more tangible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Albert spoke, he placed Angel's Kiss around Luna's neck in full view of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna's face beamed with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given her status, she could easily afford Angel's Kiss, but it was a thoughtful gesture from her boyfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, she was well aware that Albert was outranked by her in terms of family background and wealth.</span></p><div class="pagination">
