Just forget about the vice general.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This position no longer exists."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abraham was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't anticipated that Marcus was privy to the inner workings of the Dragon Tiger Hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This development had only transpired the previous day and had yet to be publicized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abraham wondered how Marcus knew this information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Abraham, is it true? Has the Dragon Tiger Hall truly capitulated to the Axe Gang?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liz inquired with a gloomy face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abraham felt a little embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nevertheless, he could only nod and respond, "Yes, the Dragon Tiger Hall did surrender to the Axe Gang yesterday.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is precisely because of Dragon Tiger Hall's accession that the Axe Gang has ascended to become the preeminent gang in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although my father is no longer the vice general, he still occupies a significant position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Moreover, his influence and authority in the gang remain intact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Consequently, it had little effect on me and my father."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing Abraham's assurances, Liz breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abraham proceeded to say, "Furthermore, there is now a highly influential figure bolstering the Axe Gang from behind the scenes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With his support, the Axe Gang will inevitably dominate the entire Kingston underground realm in due course.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dragon Tiger Hall chose this time to join the Axe Gang for the better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I might even stand a chance to see the figure in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liz immediately asked with surprise, "Really? The Axe Gang has such a big shot?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Abraham, introduce him to me, okay?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hold in high esteem such heroes who can turn the tides of fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Some men who depend on women are shameless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abraham vowed, "Okay. My father informed me yesterday that the bigwig is not only mighty but also a person of great humility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When my father has an opportunity to meet him, I shall take you along to make a friend with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bigwig that Abraham was referring to was Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Abraham remained unaware now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you hear that? The Dragon Tiger Hall has indeed submitted to the Axe Gang. But </span><span>so</span><span> what? Abraham still has a place of honor in the Axe Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, with that big shot lending his support to the Axe Gang, the Axe Gang is going to be the biggest gang in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And Abraham's value will soar to astronomical heights!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Speaking, Liz looked at Lila and remarked, "Lila, Marcus is very jealous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seeing that Abraham is more powerful than him, he tried to disparage Abraham. Devious!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila suddenly recollected that day when she was dining with Marcus, and Edmund had enlisted Raymond to deal with the two of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, Blake had arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila vividly recalled how deferential Blake had been in Marcus' presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking, Lila couldn't help but say, "Liz, Marcus is a personage even Blake holds in high regard. He can't be envious of Abraham."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abraham and Liz were stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, they gave a sneering look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liz let out a scornful laugh and retorted, "Lila, your lies are getting worse and worse. Marcus doesn't even have a job, and his parents are farmers. How could Blake possibly show respect to him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He doesn't even possess the credentials to approach Blake. Stop lying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We are family. Even if you've chosen a worthless boyfriend, I won't ridicule you. And I'll even assist you in finding a better one. But I'm disappointed in you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abraham sneered and chimed in, "That's outrageous. I have yet to encounter anyone </span><span>who can command Blake's respect and deference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's even more inconceivable. Lila, stop struggling."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While speaking, Abraham received a call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was from Darren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief conversation, Abraham said, "I recall you mentioning your intention to get married. My girlfriend's sister, Lila Sassoon, would be a perfect match for you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you agree, come over now. If the terms are agreeable, you will have a good night!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
