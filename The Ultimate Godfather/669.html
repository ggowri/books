        <h1>Chapter 668 Mental Issues</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie was stunned. She hadn't expected Marcus to act in such an unexpected and abnormal way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could say anything, the male doctor, Andy, who had previously briefed her on Mia's condition, walked over and said, "Ms. Vance, what's the deal with this person you brought? Does he have some mental issues? Please take him away, and don't let him interfere with our treatment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie had an apologetic expression, but before she could speak, another voice from the bedside interrupted her. "The patient's stomach hemorrhage has worsened. Due to insufficient blood supply, the heart rate is dropping rapidly. We need to administer a blood transfusion immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andy, who had been speaking to Natalie, paused in shock and then cast Marcus a deep, curious glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was unsure whether Marcus had just gotten lucky or if there was something more to it, but it was clear that Marcus had successfully predicted the next stage of Mia's condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you see that? Everything is going as I predicted. Go to the blood bank and get some blood for the patient immediately!" Marcus urged the doctors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Marcus released his Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, placing his palm gently on Mia's abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of Timeless Numinous Energy flowed into her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Mia's heartbeat began to stabilize, returning to normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene left all the doctors in the room wide-eyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the male doctors, his voice full of astonishment, said, "The patient's heartbeat has actually returned to normal. How is that possible? I've never seen anything like this before. Could this person really have medical skills?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Natalie watched in shock, she suddenly remembered what Marcus had told her earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, he said he could cure cancer. She didn't believe it and dismissed it as a joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, seeing the miraculous effect he had on her ankle, Natalie couldn't help but entertain a bold thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is impossible. It has to be a coincidence. How could an ordinary person have medical skills? Get him away from the patient. He'll only disrupt our treatment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andy, standing next to Natalie, firmly rejected the idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Doctor, please, let him try. I believe he can save my mother," Natalie said unexpectedly at this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctors in the room exchanged incredulous looks, unsure if they had heard her correctly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person in front of them looked no older than twenty and didn't seem particularly impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was not a renowned doctor, so how could he possibly treat a cancer patient with post-surgical complications and a massive hemorrhage?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was simply absurd!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Vance, you must take responsibility for your words! The patient's condition is critical, but there's still a slim chance of survival. If you insist on having him treat her, you will bear full responsibility for the consequences!" Andy said to Natalie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie hesitated for a while. Then, she nodded resolutely and said, "Don't worry. If I've made this decision, I won't let the hospital bear any of the consequences."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andy scoffed, "I hope you won't regret this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his view, Natalie's decision was madness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mia's condition was already so critical that even the top doctors at Solomia Hospital might not be able to save her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Natalie was asking an inexperienced young man to treat her mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if she was pushing the patient toward death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other doctors sighed, removing their hats and masks as if they were already waiting for the countdown to Mia's death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the doctor who had gone to the blood bank returned with the blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus instructed him to transfuse the blood, and the doctor complied without question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the fresh blood and Marcus' healing technique working together, the treatment went smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' martial prowess had now reached the Ancient Martial Stage Eight, far stronger than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The healing effects of the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire had also grown exponentially.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He casually infused Mia's body with Timeless Numinous Energy, and the damaged tissue in her stomach began to heal at a high speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the assistance of fresh blood, within ten minutes, Mia's complexion started to regain some color, and her breathing became more regular.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The various monitoring equipment began to show normal readings once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This miraculous scene left the doctors in a state of disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never dreamed that Marcus, with just a slight effort, could pull a cancer surgery patient who had massive blood loss back from the brink of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could this be? How is it possible? The patient was in critical condition, and now all the readings are returning to normal. Does this person really have the ability to bring someone back from the brink of death?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the doctors said in a daze as he started checking the monitoring devices.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, he thought the equipment was malfunctioning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after a thorough inspection, he confirmed everything was functioning properly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie stood frozen, her eyes wide open. A storm of emotions stirred in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that Marcus truly had the ability to cure cancer?</span></p></div>
