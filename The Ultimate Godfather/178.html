  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin blew off Amelia's warning like it was a mosquito buzzing in his ear. He seized Marcus' hand, like a drowning man clutching a life raft. "Look, if there's any way, you </span><span>gotta</span><span> come with me to Kingston. You save my daughter, and I will agree to anything. Name it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mayor Benjamin, didn't you just say Mr. Fitzgerald was an orthopedic surgeon?" Amelia reminded. "Don't let yourself get conned."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd been working with Benjamin for years, a loyal and diligent right hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd grown to care about the job, and she wasn't about to stand by and watch him get fleeced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were too many of these charlatan "miracle doctors" and self-proclaimed gurus preying on desperate people, draining their bank accounts with empty promises.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her book, Marcus looked barely out of his teens, not exactly the picture of a medical savant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I saw what Mr. Fitzgerald did with my own eyes," Benjamin turned to Amelia and retorted sternly. "Even if orthopedics is his specialty, he's got connections, right? He can get Grace to the right blood specialist. That's all I need."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't seen Edward's surgery with his own eyes, he wouldn't have bought that Marcus was any kind of medical whiz.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Marcus was his last, desperate hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, still skeptical, bit her tongue, knowing she couldn't push it further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, Mr. Fitzgerald," Benjamin pleaded, "save my daughter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bowed deeply, a gesture of utter surrender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus hesitated. He was a skilled doctor, but he wasn't a miracle worker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People died every day, and he couldn't possibly save them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then he thought about it. He'd been away from Kingston for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four companies he'd acquired were still finding their feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was also fretting over Josie and Natalia, who hit the books in Kingston. With a sigh, he reluctantly agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin's face lit up with gratitude, and he quickly asked, "When can you swing by, Mr. Fitzgerald? Should we give your expert a heads-up to tag along?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Amelia dropped that reminder, it dawned on Benjamin that Marcus might not be the one doing the healing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had this odd look on his face. "Expert? Nah, there's no expert. I'm your guy. Let's roll out right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin and Amelia exchanged a look with surprise etched on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "Was it possible? Could Marcus actually treat leukemia, not just broken bones?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clock was ticking. Less than two hours later, Marcus, Benjamin, and Amelia were on a plane headed for Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By two in the afternoon, they were at the Hematology Department of Kingston Hospital, outside the intensive care unit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was this middle-aged woman with glasses and a sharp, intelligent face. But her eyes were red-rimmed, and her features were drawn with worry as she paced anxiously outside the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Benjamin, you're finally here," she cried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment she saw Benjamin approaching, she couldn't hold it together anymore. She flung herself into his arms, sobbing like her heart would break.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was Lilian, Benjamin's wife and Grace's mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is Grace?" Benjamin asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to soothe Lilian, but his gaze was glued to the ICU door, his eyes screaming worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The doc said she's dying. They're doing what they can right now. Any later, and you might've missed saying goodbye..." Lilian answered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cries were raw with agony, her heart shattering into pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't cry," Benjamin said in excitement. "I've brought a miracle doctor for Grace. She'll be okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the flight, through chit-chat with Marcus, Benjamin could see the man oozed confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some reason, Marcus' confidence was contagious, seeping into Benjamin's bones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Lilian caught wind of this, her eyes, all puffy from the tears, sparked with a sudden light. "Where's this miracle doc?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin gestured to Marcus. "It's this young man, Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lilian seized the moment to size up Marcus. Seeing he was barely in his twenties, she </span><span>sighed with disappointment, "Benjamin, this is no time for games with our daughter's life on the line. How old is this kid? He looks barely older than Grace. If he started med school now, he wouldn't even be out yet. How's he supposed to be some miracle doctor?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin knew she wouldn't buy it, so he quickly recounted how Marcus had directed Robert during Edward's surgery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lilian gave Marcus a long, searching look. "He's a medical prodigy, sure, but he deals with bones, not blood. Our girl's got leukemia. Benjamin, feels like you're just throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
