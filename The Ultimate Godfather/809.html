        <h1>Chapter 793 Justice Executed-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's gaze remained as cold as ice. "I may not listen to every accusation, but Marcus is different. I trust him completely&mdash;because he's the man who saved my life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those words landed like a bomb in the room, leaving Pablo, Arabella, and everyone else utterly speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Around them, the crowd stood frozen, their wide eyes betraying a mixture of shock and awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Father, are you telling me... he's the one who saved your life in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>?" Pablo's voice trembled as he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian </span><span>nodded,</span><span> his eyes piercingly cold. "And now, you still dare to lie to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pablo felt as if the floor beneath him had crumbled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For days, he had heard his father speaking about the young man who had saved him, his tone filled with awe and admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pablo had even believed that if this young man wished to enter the military, his father would personally ensure he rose to the highest ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But never&mdash;never in his wildest dreams&mdash;did Pablo imagine that the young man in question was Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arabella froze too, the realization hitting her like a cold slap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had heard Pablo recount tales of this mysterious hero who saved Julian, someone she had secretly admired for his bravery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, standing before her, was the same man she had insulted, mocked, and threatened to have arrested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arabella's cheeks burned with shame, and for the first time in her career, she wished she could just vanish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest of the onlookers stood rooted in place, their jaws slack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Julian had kept the incident quiet, many of them had caught wind of the assassination attempt in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>, thanks to their high-rank background.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had heard whispers of a fearless young man who had turned the tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no one could have guessed that man was Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace Mitchell's chest tightened as she stared at Marcus, her mind struggling to piece it all together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the mayor's daughter, she had heard about the attempt on Julian's life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her father had been shaken by the news, relieved by the fact that someone saved Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace had always wondered who this hero might be&mdash;someone capable of such incredible feats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Never, not for a second, had she connected the dots to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, she could hear her heart pounding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Father, I didn't know!" Pablo suddenly burst out, his voice cracking. "If I had known he was your savior, I never would have&mdash;please, don't be angry. I'll have Benjamin Mitchell released immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With everything Pablo knew about Julian, he could tell one thing for certain&mdash;his father was genuinely furious this time. If he didn't release Benjamin immediately, the consequences would be unimaginable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's expression didn't soften in the slightest. His voice thundered through the room. "Benjamin Mitchell served as </span><span>Solomia's</span><span> mayor with integrity, building it into a city recognized on the international stage. His contributions are monumental! And yet, you&mdash;my own son&mdash;dared to drag him to Kingston on baseless charges? How could I have raised such a disgrace?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's voice trembled with fury as his body shook with barely-contained anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a man who had devoted his life to </span><span>Uswad</span><span>, Julian had hoped to spend his final years in peace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, his legacy was tainted by his own son's betrayal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pablo's lips moved as if to explain, but Julian raised a hand, silencing him. "Don't waste your breath. You've falsified evidence and abused your authority for personal vendettas. Someone like you has no place in the OIG!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning sharply to his assistant, Julian commanded, "Effective immediately, strip Pablo Ashford of his title as Director. Remove him from the Party and launch an investigation into his conduct!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The silence that followed was deafening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And a sheer shiver crept onto their spines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one dared to speak, the weight of Julian's words pressing down on the room like a leaden cloud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the air seemed to grow heavier under Julian's imposing presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pablo's knees buckled as he collapsed to the floor, his face pale and drenched in sweat.</span></p></div>
