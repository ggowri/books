  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before the officers could take action, a cold voice echoed down the hallway. "Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone turned to see a group of uniformed officers making their way up the stairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the forefront was a tall, robust, middle-aged police officer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was none other than Dustin of the Solomia Police Department.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dustin was a well-known figure, a model police officer famous in Solomia for his past achievements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, as soon as he arrived, several of the neighbors immediately recognized him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people were surprised&mdash;no one had expected him to show up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Dexter froze for a moment, his eyes flickering with surprise as he asked, "Mr. Lloyd, what brings you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dustin and Dexter graduated from the same police academy and had been working in Solomia ever since.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dustin had risen through the ranks based on his personal abilities, eventually becoming the head of the criminal unit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dexter, on the other hand, had secured his position as deputy chief of the police precinct through connections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both held the same administrative rank, and viewed each other as competitors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dexter was surprised to see Dustin here today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gibson, if I didn't come, you'd be causing a big mess," Dustin said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While speaking, he waved his hand, and the ten or so criminal police officers behind him swiftly moved forward, surrounding Dexter and his team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd around them stiffened in shock, realizing that Dustin's arrival was far from friendly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, many of them were confused about why Dustin, a member of the same police force as Dexter, would immediately surround him upon arrival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dexter's face darkened. He said coldly, "We're handling an ongoing investigation in this police precinct. Mr. Lloyd, what is the meaning of this? Are you going to overstep your authority?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dustin sneered, "Gibson, do you even know who this young man is? It seems you've really let things go to your head!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words caused a stir in the crowd. They couldn't help but wonder if Marcus had an unexpected and distinguished background.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dexter, however, scoffed, "He's just my tenant. You think he could be someone important? He's just a migrant worker, nothing to make a fuss about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like the older you get, the more cowardly you become. You're on your way to becoming a coward!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dustin seemed uninterested in Dexter's mockery. He replied coldly, "This young man is Mr. Fitzgerald, someone who is highly regarded by Mayor Benjamin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But that's not the most important part. What matters is that you're guilty of corruption, accepting bribes, neglecting your duties, and aiding criminals. The Department of Justice is investigating you. I've been ordered to arrest you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Dustin gestured for his officers. The criminal police drew their guns, aiming them directly at Dexter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone around them gasped. None of them had expected the Department of Justice to take action against Dexter at such a crucial moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the officers with their guns drawn, Helen became worried and asked, "Honey, you're being investigated. What should we do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dexter showed little panic. He snapped at her, "Why are you panicking? I'm right here! Have you forgotten who's in control of Solomia?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen's face lit up with a smug smile as she realized something. "You're right, honey," she said. "Our cousin is the City Governor of Solomia. I almost forgot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd suddenly grasped why Dexter had been acting with such impunity&mdash;Hank Foster, the City Governor, was his cousin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Dexter became the deputy chief of the police precinct, he had been using his position to amass wealth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of serving the people and upholding justice, he had committed numerous immoral acts, even colluding with criminals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no one had dared to intervene. It turned out that it was all due to his connection to Hank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hank and Dexter had done an excellent job of keeping their relationship under wraps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Dexter hadn't brought it up just now, no one present would have known that they were cousins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Dustin had only heard rumors about it but hadn't dared to confirm them&mdash;until now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Lloyd, surprised, huh? My husband is Hank's cousin. Let me tell you, even Benjamin can't do anything to my husband, let alone someone like you, a mere criminal police chief!" Helen said smugly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dustin's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had just received a call from Amelia in the Mayor's Office, instructing him to assist the Department of Justice in arresting Dexter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he hadn't expected that Dexter would bring up Hank, a powerful figure, as his protector.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Benjamin was often seen in Solomia's political matters, the true authority rested with Hank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hank was just older and preferred to stay out of the limelight, but that didn't mean he didn't wield significant power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This left Dustin caught in a dilemma, torn between supporting Benjamin, the Department of Justice, and Marcus, or aligning with Hank and Dexter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hank clearly held a higher rank than Benjamin, but Dustin couldn't overlook Marcus's influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Dustin didn't know Marcus's exact background, the fact that both Benjamin and the head of Solomia Special Police Academy, Brenden, treated him with such respect indicated that Marcus held an extraordinary position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Hank couldn't command such respect from Benjamin and Brenden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After careful consideration, Dustin decided to remain on Marcus and Benjamin's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a risky decision, but the current situation left him little choice but to pick a side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lloyd, what's it going to be? Are you still planning to arrest me?" Dexter asked smugly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, he hadn't intended to bring up his cousin Hank, but these people had pushed him to the edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Dexter's surprise, as soon as he said that, Dustin said, "Dexter Gibson is guilty of corruption and serious misconduct. Arrest him immediately and hand him over to the Department of Justice for investigation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The criminal police officers around them were momentarily stunned. They hadn't expected Dustin to order Dexter's arrest, even after learning about his connection to Hank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they were just ordinary officers, and they had to follow their superior's orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Hank were to place blame, it would fall on their superiors who issued the orders, not on the lower-ranking officers like them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Led by one of the officers, they quickly restrained Dexter, putting handcuffs on him and preparing to take him away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dexter let out an angry roar and turned to Dustin, gritting his teeth. "Lloyd, you really have guts. You know my cousin is the City Governor, and you still dare to arrest me. Just you wait! Once my cousin gets here, you'll be stripped of your position!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, don't worry. I'll call Hank right now and have him deal with this guy, as well as that hick and that bitch!" Almost simultaneously, Helen spoke up, dialing a number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A slightly older voice came from the other end of the line. It was none other than Hank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helen recounted everything that had happened in detail, naturally adding her own embellishments and distorting the facts as she went.</span></p><div class="pagination">
