  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing the cold threat, Melina became anxious and said to Marcus, "Marcus, it must be the Watson family that has come. What should we do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus frowned and gave Melina a reassuring look, saying, "You just need to wait here. I will handle it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Marcus put on his clothes and swaggered out of the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the villa stood hundreds of people, led by a middle-aged man in a suit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man exuded a powerful aura, radiating the authority of a leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was none other than Gabriel, Nolan's father and the head of the Watson family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind him stood the thugs he had brought with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus clearly saw that these thugs all carried guns, well-trained individuals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of them were mercenaries or retirees from special ops units.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They possessed formidable combat skills. Over a hundred of them formed a siege against Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beside Gabriel was Nolan, who was in a sorry state after being tortured by Marcus, sitting in a wheelchair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Gabriel had used special means to relieve Nolan's drunkenness, he still appeared extremely dazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you Marcus?" Gabriel asked sternly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's me." Marcus calmly nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You actually dared to humiliate my son in front of everyone and hurt his men. You have some nerve. I will definitely seek justice for my son," Gabriel said through gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan was not only his son but also the sole heir of the Watson family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing that Nolan had been so humiliated by Marcus made Gabriel furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After learning that Marcus could subdue Nolan, Gabriel made ample preparations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He not only mobilized the strongest batch of people from his family but also armed them with the most powerful weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition, not far behind him stood two powerful warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These two came from the Swords Sect, having reached the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Three, and were Nolan's mentors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their strength was unfathomable, true experts in their field.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Gabriel's view, with </span><span>those two present</span><span> along with over a hundred armed warriors, Marcus would surely not survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at Gabriel and noticed the two Swords Sect warriors standing behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Marcus was completely unconcerned and asked Gabriel, "What do you want me to pay for this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gabriel sneered, "My demands are simple. First, you cut off your own arms and apologize to my son. Second, you will be killed by us here. You choose."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was filled with endless arrogance as if Marcus was already a fish on his chopping board, ready for slaughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus scoffed, "What if I choose neither?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gabriel glared at Marcus. "It looks like you are going to resist to the end. But that won't be up to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gabriel made a gesture to the people beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those individuals drew their guns, aiming them all at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The villa was engulfed by a strong atmosphere of bloodshed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gabriel stood with his hands behind his back, proudly saying, "You may have some strength, but under my complete siege, you have no choice. You either sever your arms or get swallowed by bullets. Those are your only two options."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus scanned the group and replied, "Do you believe that before they shoot, I can kill you a hundred times?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gabriel's expression changed momentarily, and then he burst into derisive laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others present joined in the laughter as well, especially the two powerful warriors from the Swords Sect, who laughed the loudest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to Marcus' high cultivation level and his deliberate suppression of his aura, those two thought that Marcus was at most an Ancient Martial Stage Two, which created a large gap between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't understand why Marcus dared to say such arrogant words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I would like to see how you intend to kill me before they shoot," Gabriel mocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he ordered his subordinates to collectively open fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before Gabriel's voice dropped, Marcus' body appeared before him like a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gabriel didn't have time to react before Marcus grasped his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deathly aura enveloped Gabriel from all sides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gabriel's gaze towards Marcus changed. He looked shocked, "How did you do that? You were standing thirty feet away. How did you get to me so quickly? Are you human or a ghost?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Gabriel's throat in Marcus' grip, the armed warriors hesitated to act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two Swords Sect warriors became alert. They too didn't expect Marcus to control Gabriel right under their noses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such speed was far beyond Ancient Martial Stage Two's capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing his father held by Marcus, Nolan in the wheelchair threatened, "Let go of my father immediately, or my two masters will not let you go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, ignored Nolan. Without any hesitation, he tightened his grip, and with a crack, a sound resounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan's eyes widened in horror and disbelief, filled with despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never dreamed that Marcus would truly dare to snap Gabriel's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After struggling desperately for a moment, Gabriel became a lifeless corpse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene left everyone dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nobody expected Marcus to kill Gabriel, which meant he had completely become an enemy of the Watson family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad! Dad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan broke down, feeling much of his drunkenness vanish at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Marcus with wide eyes and shouted in rage, "You really dared to kill my father! I must tear you apart!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan gestured to the warriors, signaling the hundreds of them to pull the trigger on Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were very close to Marcus and had a numerical advantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan believed that as long as those hundreds fired at the same time, anyone would inevitably be riddled with bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before those people could fire their guns, Marcus unleashed an incredibly terrifying Binding Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This Binding Force was invisible and intangible, yet it enveloped a vast area of space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warriors found themselves captured by the Binding Force, unable to move an inch.</span></p><div class="pagination">
