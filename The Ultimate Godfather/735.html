        <h1>Chapter 734 Kill This Guy!</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the man spoke, he threw a punch directly at Marcus. This wasn't just any ordinary strike&mdash;it came from a former elite mercenary. The angle was calculated and vicious, aimed squarely at Marcus' vital points, with a force rivaling that of professional fighters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other men stood back, smirking coldly. To them, Marcus was no match for their comrade. One man was more than enough to deal with someone like him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Fist Ray shot forward with lightning speed, closing the gap between them in an </span><span>instant. But Marcus only curled his lips into a faint, mocking smile. His hand darted out like a flash of lightning, catching the attacker's wrist mid-strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's expression froze&mdash;he hadn't anticipated that Marcus would react so swiftly. He immediately threw a second punch, this time aiming for Marcus' temple with even more ferocity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus wasn't about to give him the chance. With a quick tug, he threw the man off balance, then brought his hand down hard on the attacker's wrist. A loud snap echoed in the air, followed by a bloodcurdling scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's arm twisted unnaturally, and before he could recover, Marcus' fist slammed into his face with crushing force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thud!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man collapsed onto the ground, his nose shattered, teeth broken, and blood streaming down his face. His screams were gut-wrenching, his figure utterly pathetic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other men froze, stunned. They had underestimated Marcus, assuming he was just another easy target. Even Chloe, standing to the side, couldn't hide her shock.</span> <span>She had never expected Marcus to possess such </span><span>strength.</span><span>She</span><span> had only seen Marcus' refined demeanor at the party, where his impressive status overshadowed his strength. Apart from a brief altercation with the photographer, he hadn't displayed much physical prowess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, witnessing his sheer power, Chloe realized Marcus was far more formidable than she had imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you all standing around? Get him! Kill this guy!" the injured man bellowed, his voice dripping with hatred. His fury toward Marcus had reached its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others quickly snapped out of their daze and rushed at Marcus together. Since Marcus had shown he wasn't an easy target, they weren't about to fight fair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Attacks rained down on Marcus from every direction, each one aimed to disable or kill. But Marcus' eyes glinted coldly. If there was one thing he despised, it was bullies. And these men were particularly despicable, targeting a defenseless woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't hold back. In the blink of an eye, the air filled with the dull sound of punches landing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' fists moved with precision and devastating power, each blow leaving his opponents groaning in pain. Within moments, the men lay sprawled on the ground, some with broken bones, others knocked unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire fight lasted less than ten seconds. Marcus dusted off his hands as if nothing had happened and turned to Chloe, who was still frozen in shock. "</span><span>You</span><span> okay?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took Chloe a moment to respond. She nodded hesitantly, her voice barely above a whisper. "Thank you, Marcus. If it weren't for you, I would've..." She bit her lip, her voice trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her pride made it difficult to express her gratitude, especially after what had happened at the party a few days ago. Back then, she had apologized to Marcus, only to be met with his cold dismissal&mdash;an acknowledgment that they were merely strangers who had crossed paths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That remark had stung deeply, leaving her hesitant to face him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're a friend of Lila's," Marcus said casually. "I wasn't about to stand by and do nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe was still trembling slightly, the shock of the encounter lingering in her body. Just then, a light rain began to fall, the cold droplets amplifying her shivers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a word, Marcus took off his jacket and draped it over her shoulders. The warmth immediately eased her chills. "Where do you live? I'll take you home," Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sunridge Estates," Chloe replied softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My car's over there. Let's go," he said, already walking toward his car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe hesitated for a moment, biting her lip, before following him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they got into the car, the drizzle turned into a downpour, rain hammering against the windshield like an unending torrent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good thing you're taking me home. I'd have been soaked to the bone otherwise," Chloe said, glancing at Marcus with gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From this angle, Marcus' profile was striking&mdash;handsome in a way that exuded strength and confidence. Unlike the delicate features of some men, Marcus' face carried a rugged charm that was impossible to ignore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe's heart skipped a beat, but she quickly pushed the thought aside. She couldn't let herself feel this way&mdash;not about Lila's boyfriend. That would be crossing a line she couldn't forgive herself for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those men... they were Zachary's bodyguards from Royal Entertainment," Chloe said quietly. "By standing up for me, you've made yourself an enemy of theirs. I'm so sorry for dragging you into this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus simply shook his head. "I've already crossed that line. Zachary's grudge against me was sealed the moment I humiliated Ross in public."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was calm, but his eyes glinted dangerously. "If Zachary dares to come after me, I'll make sure both the Walsh family and Royal Entertainment are wiped off the map."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intensity of his words sent a chill down Chloe's spine. For a moment, she believed him. Marcus wasn't the type to make empty threats&mdash;if Zachary pushed him, the consequences would be catastrophic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rain continued to pour as the car crawled toward Sunridge Estates. Without an umbrella, they were stuck waiting for the storm to let up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a sudden surge of spiritual powers swept over the car. Marcus' eyes narrowed as he sensed the lethal intent. The air seemed to hum with the sharpness of an invisible blade, cutting through the rain and locking onto their vehicle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait here. Someone's here to throw their life away," Marcus said, his tone firm. "I'll handle this. Don't move until I'm back."</span></p></div>
