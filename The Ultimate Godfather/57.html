  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the following days, Marcus didn't leave his house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He focused on practicing the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire in his villa, and his cultivation successfully reached the minor completion stage of Ancient Martial Stage Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, he also looked through the Magic Codex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gained a preliminary understanding of the training methods for Wizards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he could cast some basic spells, such as Telekinesis, Fireball, and Lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Marcus did not become a true Wizard, and his spells basically had no offensive power and could only be used for performances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus was not discouraged. With this Magic Codex, as long as he practiced diligently, he would one day become a true Wizard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, he could be both a Wizard and a warrior, and his strength would inevitably be stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, it was Wednesday when the Solomia Land Exchange held the land auction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He received a call from Michelle early in the morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus prepared five billion dollars in funds, and he was determined to get the land on Bayside Avenue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Driving an Alphard business van, Marcus picked up Michelle, and they arrived at the land exchange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps because the location of this land was superior, there were many people who came to bid, including many business groups from other cities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the many bidders, Marcus saw a familiar figure&mdash; Haley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting next to Haley was his father, Jared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five days ago, Haley was cut off his hands by Bob, and it was unexpected that he came out to be active so soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hands were wrapped in thick bandages, and it seemed that they were successfully reconnected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haley naturally also noticed Marcus and the hatred in his eyes was undisguised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At nine o'clock, many bidders sat down, and the auction officially started.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, that Marcus seems to want to bid for this land. We can't let him succeed," Haley said to Jared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jared glanced at Marcus not far away and then withdrew his gaze and said, "Bidding this land is an order from the Brown family in Kingston. With their support, I am not afraid of him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, the Brown family in Kingston only gave him three billion dollars, and the excess part needs to be paid by TreatMed Pharmaceuticals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in order to vent for Haley, even if he can't bid successfully, he can't let Marcus get it easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The bidding officially starts. Today we are auctioning a piece of land on Bayside Avenue, west of Meadows Road, covering 123.5 acres, with a starting price of one billion dollars. Ladies and gentlemen, you can bid now!" On the stage, a woman with a good image and temperament smiled and said to everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone said, "One billion dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another said, "One point one billion dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet another said, "One point five billion dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man said, "One point eight billion dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people started to bid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This piece of land was unique in value, and everyone wanted to swallow this piece of cake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, should we bid?" Michelle asked Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied lightly, "It's not the right time. Wait a moment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the price was raised to three billion dollars, which exceeded the budget of most people on the scene, and no one bid for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three point one billion dollars." Marcus knew it was time for him to enter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt such a good piece of land it was impossible to be photographed for a dozen or two billion dollars; these people were simply wasting time before!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three point two billion dollars!" However, as soon as Marcus's voice fell, Jared, not far away, said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Golden Group and TreatMed Pharmaceuticals were the two giants in Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recently, the news that the two companies have terminated their cooperation has caused a lot of shock in the industry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two companies were competing for land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people present realized that the real competition was about to start.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three point five billion dollars!" Marcus looked confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before participating in the auction, Diana had collected all the details of all the companies participating in the auction this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides TreatMed Pharmaceuticals, she also learned about the relationship between Jared and the Brown family in Kingston and even the maximum amount of money Jared could offer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus never fought battles he wasn't sure of winning. For this auction, he had already made ample preparations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus so confident, Jared felt a little uncertain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he still shouted out the price of four billion dollars with a stiff head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Four point five billion dollars!" Marcus spoke without hesitation; in order to enter the pharmaceutical industry, he was also desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five billion dollars!" Jared seems to be determined to fight against Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five point five billion dollars!" The price had already exceeded Marcus' previous budget, but it was still within his acceptable range.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Six billion dollars!" Jared said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a few rounds of bidding, Jared saw that Marcus had a strong desire for this land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly had an idea. In the next few rounds, no matter how much Marcus offered, he would raise it by five hundred million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the price came to nine billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nine point five billion dollars!" Jared bid again without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Jared Brown, you are indeed generous. This land is yours," Marcus said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jared thought that Marcus would continue to raise the price. In this way, his scheme to deliberately raise the price would succeed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Marcus directly gave up the auction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nine point five billion dollars once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nine point five billion dollars twice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nine point five billion dollars three times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Congratulations to Mr. Jared Brown for the successful auction," the hostess said.</span></p><div class="pagination">
