        <h1>Chapter 446 Crying in Despair</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tristan collapsed to the floor, sobbing uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He crawled toward Marcus, throwing himself at his feet and clinging to his legs, disregarding any remaining shred of pride. "Please, sir, it's all my fault. I beg you&mdash;please forgive me, for the sake of our family," he pleaded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fall from a multimillionaire to an absolute nobody was more than Tristan could bear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And all of this had happened in a single instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a blow too devastating for him to handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the face of such a blow, his pride was the last thing on his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus, without a trace of sympathy, shoved him away, sneering. "Family? You didn't seem to care about that before. Don't come crawling to me now. I'm just giving back everything you tried to give me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Marcus turned to Jane and said, "It's getting late. We should head back to Solomia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane nodded quietly, her gaze lingering on Marcus for a moment. She felt a strange, almost dizzying sensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Until now, she'd always thought of Marcus as simply the chairman of Golden Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, she realized his influence extended far beyond just that company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the massive Kingston-based corporations, Eastcomm Group and BioFusion Pharmaceuticals, were under his control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One phone call, and Tristan's entire future had been decided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The calm confidence Marcus exuded, the way he could change the course of events with a single gesture, was utterly captivating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Goodbye, Mr. Death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Marcus prepared to leave, Miles and Riley immediately saluted him with perfect precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus waved them off casually and got into his BMW. The engine roared to life, and he drove off, disappearing into the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Honey, do you think they'll be okay? Will they really be arrested?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the car, Jane couldn't hide her worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, they were her blood relatives, and part of her struggled with the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They'll be detained for about 15 days, nothing serious. It's just a lesson for them," Marcus answered calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since they weren't guilty of anything as severe as human trafficking, the punishment would be minimal&mdash;just an administrative penalty at most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus had only said what he did to scare them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane sighed in relief, feeling her anxiety melt away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, they didn't stop anywhere. They drove straight back to Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The journey was long, and by the time they arrived, Marcus was exhausted enough to sleep soundly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next morning, they drove to the Pharmaceutical Industrial Park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The park was buzzing with activity now that it had officially gone into production.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus headed to the top floor of the headquarters building, where he rang the bell at the CEO's office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Come in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne's voice called from inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus opened the door to find Yvonne sitting at her desk, fully immersed in the documents before her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Today, she wore a sharp business suit that accentuated her curves, every detail showcasing her figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her focus only heightened the professional allure she exuded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There's an important batch of documents I need to go over. I told you no interruptions. Why are you here?" Yvonne muttered, still looking down, thinking it was her secretary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you don't want me to interrupt you, I guess I should just leave," Marcus teased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne's head shot up when she heard his voice. Her eyes met his, and a playful frown tugged at her lips. "Oh, so you finally decided to come see me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a smile, Marcus moved closer and pulled her into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne instinctively tried to pull away, but with no luck&mdash;Marcus was stronger, and she found herself unable to escape his grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm here, aren't I?" Marcus said with a grin, pressing a kiss to Yvonne's cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne shuddered slightly, her body softening, but she tried to maintain her cool exterior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're such a jerk! After the first time we were together, you've barely come by to see me. You're the type who gets what he wants and disappears," Yvonne huffed, shaking her fist and lightly hitting him on the chest, letting her frustration show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus just pulled her closer, kissing her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mmm..." Yvonne moaned softly, her face flushing as her body responded to his kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had only been with Marcus a few times, and she was still new to the dynamics of a relationship like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More sensitive than most, even the smallest touch from him left her breathless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' hand slid down to her chest, cupping her curves, and Yvonne let out a soft gasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She shot him a glare but couldn't quite hide the growing desire. "This is the office! We can't be doing this here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus, unbothered, kissed her again and led her toward the office door. One hand continued to explore her body while the other locked the door behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the intensity of the kiss deepened, so did their passion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They hadn't seen each other in days, and all the pent-up emotions Yvonne had been holding back were now pouring out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet even as her body melted into his, part of her still fought to keep some control. "Someone might see us... This is the office, Marcus!"</span></p></div>
