  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up the phone, Josie returned to her office only to find Marcus already sitting in the company courtyard, leisurely smoking a cigarette.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His demeanor gave no indication of someone waiting for an impending danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The calmness exuded by Marcus was unsettling, even making Josie feel a slight twinge of fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Less than half an hour later, Walter returned, flanked by dozens of men from the underworld, wielding clubs. They stormed into the courtyard of BioFusion Pharmaceuticals, exuding a threatening presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus still seated, Walter had a satisfied smile as he said, "You really don't know when to quit, do you? You actually dared to wait here for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at the thugs behind Walter and said, "You've called too few. These amateurs won't last long against me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter smirked. "Marcus, have you gone insane? Do you really think you can fight these guys? Let me be clear with you: These men are from the Kingston Axe Gang, each one a ruthless killer, heartless enough to slit throats without hesitation. What can you do with your scrawny body?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the Axe Gang members, a one-eyed man, turned to Walter and asked, "Mr. Wollaston, how do you want us to deal with this guy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter grinned maliciously and replied, "Break his arms and legs. I want him to spend the rest of his life in bed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The one-eyed man smiled cruelly. "Don't worry, Mr. Wollaston. Baron specifically instructed me to ensure everything is handled to your satisfaction," he said with a sinister grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, boys, get him!" The one-eyed man barked orders to his underlings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie, pale with fear, hadn't expected Walter to bring so many people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She anxiously thought to herself, "Why hasn't Allen arrived yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frantic, Josie quickly turned to Marcus. "Mr. Fitzgerald, there are too many of them! You should go into my office and hide. I'll call the security team to stop them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus casually stood up from his seat and waved his hand dismissively. "Don't worry, these small fries don't stand a chance against me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Marcus began stretching his muscles, preparing for the inevitable fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group of Axe Gang members swung their weapons and charged at Marcus, their attacks aimed directly at his vital spots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each strike was precise, fierce, and reckless, showing no regard for their own safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus grinned with interest as he met their attacks head-on, moving fluidly as he fought back with his fists and feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom... Boom... Boom...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sounds of fists connecting with flesh echoed loudly as Marcus dispatched the Axe Gang members one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than three minutes, every single one of the armed thugs was lying on the ground, moaning in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene left the employees of BioFusion Pharmaceuticals in stunned disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never could have imagined that Marcus was capable of such a display of strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie's eyes widened in admiration. She watched Marcus move with such grace and skill, feeling almost mesmerized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder he was so confident&mdash;he was truly formidable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter and the one-eyed man exchanged uneasy glances. Marcus's strength had surpassed their expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The one-eyed man, knowing he was no match for Marcus, but unwilling to lose face, spoke with cold venom. "I'll admit I underestimated you, but you've made a huge mistake by attacking our men. The Axe Gang won't just let this slide. You better prepare yourself, because Baron is coming to handle you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, the one-eyed man dialed a number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up, he turned to Walter with a confident smile. "Mr. Wollaston, Baron will be here in five minutes. Just wait, this guy won't get away with this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter nodded, his face contorted in anger as he turned to Marcus. "I was going to break your limbs and let you rot, but now you've angered the Axe Gang. Your punishment will be far worse than I ever planned!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave Walter a curious look, unsure of where his confidence was coming from.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie, upon hearing that Baron Bane was on his way, became even more anxious. "Mr. Fitzgerald, Baron is one of the Four Kings of the Kingston underworld. He's a major figure in the city. You should leave now! I'm afraid they'll bring more people."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Baron? Baron Bane?" Marcus casually asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had often heard the name from Edgar, the leader of the Seven Stars Association.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly, Baron. So, you've heard of his fame. In that case, why don't you spare yourself the trouble and end it now, before Baron comes down here to deal with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing that Marcus knew of Baron, the one-eyed man swelled with pride, as if it were his own name that carried weight, not Baron's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt honored to be associated with such a powerful figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just bring Baron to me," Marcus said nonchalantly as he casually sat back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter sneered. "This guy doesn't know when to quit. When Baron gets here, he'll regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thugs who had been knocked out glared at Marcus with cold, murderous eyes, eager to see him punished by Baron.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>About five minutes later, several black Mercedes-Benz G-Wagons pulled up and stopped quickly in the parking lot of BioFusion Pharmaceuticals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Baron, surrounded by several of his thugs, stepped out of the vehicle. He exuded an air of lethal intent.</span></p><div class="pagination">
