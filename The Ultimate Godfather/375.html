        <h1>Chapter 374 You Know</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, wait for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Maxine ran over, looked up at Marcus' side face, and said apologetically, "I had mistaken you before. I'm sorry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of her judgment against Marcus, Maxine felt guilty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled and said, "Then how do you want to apologize to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine looked stunned, gnashed her teeth, and said, "I'm apologizing to you. What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"According to your logic, those murderers can be excused by saying sorry?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are stealing the concept. I don't want to talk to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine was stamped with anger. She knew that Marcus was deliberately making things difficult for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're going to ignore me, right? Then I'll go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus left Maxine without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus so utterly, Maxine was even angrier. She hurriedly caught up with him and said, "How could you leave like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are ignoring me. Why should I still be here? It's better to go home and sleep early."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said and wanted to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine grabbed his wrist and said, "What do you want me to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus pointed to his lips and said, "It's simple. You know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine blushed, stood on tiptoe, and kissed Marcus' lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this scene was just seen by Oliver and others who came out of the data center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, they are kissing. Beauties always love heroes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, if I were a woman, I would also like a man like Mr. Death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you become a woman, you will be surprisingly ugly. Mr. Death won't be interested in you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several SWAT officers were talking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine blushed and wanted to hide. She said, "It's all your fault. It was seen!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled and said, "So what? I'm your man approved by your family. Isn't it normal for you to kiss me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine didn't want to talk to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several SWAT officers were still whispering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver yelled at them, "Don't talk about it anymore. Mr. Death's matters are not something we can talk about casually. Do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver's deterrence was still very strong, and his words made those people shut up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, the sound of sirens came from the road not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brenden came with people from Solomia Special Police Academy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus and others out of the information database, Brenden greeted him with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, thanks for your work!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brenden was the first to shake hands with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it happened before, it would inevitably attract a large number of SWAT officers to complain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Oliver was here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, no one dared to speak, even Oliver didn't feel anything wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of them could get out alive without Marcus in this action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just a little effort. You're welcome."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled and waved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, surrounded by people from Solomia Special Police Academy, Marcus and others sat on the returning vehicles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the second day, Solomia Special Police Academy held a large commendation meeting for this action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, as the person who killed the enemy the most and played the biggest role in this action, won the honorary title of Death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus' position was empty. He didn't come to receive the prize. For him, this reputation was meaningless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Maxine hadn't begged for him to take part in this action, he wouldn't have promised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Marcus was practicing in the Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After reaching Ancient Martial Stage Five, Marcus felt that the speed of cultivation was much slower than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he got hundreds of various pills from Asher, they were not so effective.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that the higher stage of the cultivation, the more difficult it was to break through the boundary, and he had to find a breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the afternoon, he received a phone call from Josie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to talk to him about the transportation of production equipment to pharmaceutical companies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two agreed that the production line would arrive in Solomia the day after tomorrow, and it would take about three days for the installation so that the pharmaceutical company could be officially put into production.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overseas, somewhere in a deserted snowy land, the sky was snowy and the wind was blowing hard. It was a forbidden area for life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But under this vast ice sheet, there was a huge underground palace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Somewhere in the headquarters in the palace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tall man in a military green combat suit was watching in front of the sand table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had an appearance of Weston Land. His face revealed a bit of heroism, and he released a powerful aura as if he were born king.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next to the man, there was a sexy and beautiful woman from Weston Land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Roger Gellar, the mission in Uswad has failed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a man walked into the operation room and reported to Roger with a pale face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger looked gloomy.</span></p></div>
