  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was equally stunned by Marcus' words, unsure how he had figured it out so easily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You... You're lying. I don't have genital warts... You're just making stuff up!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An STD was a condition nobody wanted to admit to having, and Fiona was certainly not going to own up to it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She immediately shot back, denying the accusation and then launching into a heated tirade at Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus chuckled coldly, "I'm not here to get into a debate with you. The disease is on your body, not mine. Your husband's been messing around, picked something up, and now you've got it. And yet, you're still covering for him. You must be out of your mind."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fiona was stunned by Marcus' ability to figure her out, but the fact that he was airing her dirty laundry in public sent her rage into overdrive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her teeth gritted, and she snapped at Marcus, "This is none of your business. How dare you slander me? I'm going to make you regret this, I swear!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she spoke, Fiona lunged at him, confident that with her status, Marcus wouldn't dare retaliate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But as she reached him, Marcus slapped her across the face with a swift, brutal motion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fiona let out a loud scream as she was knocked to the ground, her face instantly swelling, the skin turning an ugly mix of red and purple.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her cry of pain was so ear-piercing it sounded like an animal in distress.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You little bastard! How dare you hit me? When my husband gets here, he'll make you pay! You'll be begging for my forgiveness!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fiona lay sprawled on the floor, clutching her bruised face, shooting Marcus a murderous glare as she screamed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus sneered, "Oh? Your husband's some big shot, huh? Fine, go ahead and call him. Let's see how he's going to make me 'pay'."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The room went dead silent for a moment, stunned by Marcus' audacity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one had expected him to be so bold&mdash;Fiona's husband was none other than Maximilian, the executive vice president of </span><span>SiliconWave</span><span> Technologies.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His name carried weight in both Kingston and </span><span>Solomia</span><span>, and his connections spanned across both the business world and the criminal underworld.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Maximilian found out Marcus had struck his wife, there was no way he would just let it slide.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The noise from the altercation quickly drew the attention of several patrons who had been coming and going from other rooms.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera's friends hadn't left yet. They'd been watching from a distance, too scared to intervene.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were all in their twenties, and though they wanted to help, they were just too intimidated to act.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Marcus slap Fiona, they all felt a rush of nervousness for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They knew this was trouble. Big trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're in for it now," Fiona spat as she dialed her husband's number. "You wait. I'm calling Maximilian right now. When he gets here, you'll be on your knees, begging for mercy!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The phone rang and quickly connected.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Maximilian was still in the middle of a meeting with an important client at the karaoke bar.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The interruption immediately soured his mood, but the fact that his wife had been struck left him seething with rage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without a second thought, he slammed his drink down, excused himself from his clients, and stormed out of the room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His clients followed, eager to find out who had the nerve to lay hands on Maximilian's wife.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What the hell happened? Who did this to you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maximilian's face darkened as he looked at Fiona, who was still on the floor, groaning in pain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's this damn bastard," Fiona hissed, pointing directly at Marcus. "You can't let him get away with this. Get him! Make him beg for my forgiveness!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maximilian followed Fiona's finger and glared at Marcus, his eyes blazing with </span><span>murderous intent.</span></p><div class="pagination">
