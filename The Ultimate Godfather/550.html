        <h1>Chapter 549 Big Misunderstanding</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the evening descended, the sky darkened slowly, and the air became cooler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus led Lila to a quiet lakeside park in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because the park was tucked away in a remote area, there were barely any visitors, and with the evening settling in, there was almost no one around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt nervous, so much so that the pain in her ankle seemed to fade into the background.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald... I know there aren't many people here, but sometimes there are passersby. Maybe we should find somewhere else?" Lila </span><span>hesitated,</span><span> her voice quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a modest girl, and because of her strong principles, she had always avoided any kind of inappropriate behavior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after everything that had happened, she found herself completely charmed by Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aside from her gratitude, she felt an overwhelming sense of admiration for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, as she thought about what might happen next, she realized she wasn't as repelled as she expected. There was even a hint of anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Women are naturally drawn to strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If a man is strong enough, any woman will fall for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was handsome, powerful, and wealthy. He was the kind of man no woman could resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Lila's words seemed to leave Marcus a little confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean? I'm not quite following."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila blushed deeply, biting her lip before replying, "Mr. Fitzgerald, you brought me here... Didn't you want something to happen between us?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that's what you want... I won't refuse, but this place feels too open. It would be better to pick somewhere more private. I'm just not comfortable here..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face turned even redder as she spoke, embarrassment spreading across her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Marcus realize what she meant, and he couldn't help but feel slightly amused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, you thought... I brought you here for that? I was just trying to help with your ankle! I didn't think you'd get the wrong idea."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Lila realized her mistake, her face flushed even deeper, and she wished she could disappear into the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had jumped to conclusions again. It was so awkward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at the same time, a small pang of disappointment flickered in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I not attractive enough?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He doesn't want anything to happen?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isn't it normal for men in his position to sleep with the women around them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why is he being so... respectable?" Lila's thoughts ran wild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly felt like a completely different person, someone who was no longer the innocent girl she used to be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, you know medicine?" Lila asked, a bit surprised as she snapped back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had already seemed like someone out of her league, but if he could heal </span><span>injuries too, that would be unbelievable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know a little," Marcus replied with a shrug, sounding humble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he gently took her injured ankle in his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The instant his hands touched her, a sharp pain shot through Lila, causing her to wince slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't seem bothered. He pressed and gently squeezed around the area, quickly identifying the source of her discomfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, with a calm movement, he began to peel off her stockings, revealing her long, smooth leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From where he stood, he could even catch a glimpse of her thigh...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila's heart raced as she felt his gaze linger on her leg. The tension in her body was undeniable, and she could hardly focus on anything but the way her pulse quickened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hang in there. It should take about 20 minutes," Marcus said to Lila, his voice calm but reassuring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it seemed like a simple ankle twist, Marcus' X-ray vision revealed something more serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The injury had actually damaged her tendons and bones. If she went to a hospital, she'd likely have to stay in bed for at least 10 to 15 days, and she'd need a couple of months of rest afterward. It was a pretty severe sprain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," Lila replied, nodding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus focused, channeling Timeless Numinous Energy into his palms and pressing it against the swollen part of her ankle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost instantly, a warm, soothing sensation spread from his hand into her ankle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The relief was so intense that Lila couldn't help but let out a soft sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She closed her eyes for a moment, enjoying the unexpected comfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though it was just her ankle, the foot is considered the body's "second heart," full of important reflex points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, this particular spot had a meridian that connected directly to her sensitive area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus' energy flowed into her ankle, that meridian was gently activated, sending waves of sensation through her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body trembled slightly, her face flushed a deep red, and a quiet moan slipped from her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald," Lila looked up at him, her voice low and soft, "Why does it feel so... good? Just for my ankle... ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes held a subtle, questioning look as she spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sensation was unlike anything she'd felt before, stirring something inside her she couldn't quite control.</span></p></div>
