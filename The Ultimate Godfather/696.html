  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila nodded at Chloe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe asked Marcus unhappily, "What is your relationship with Lila?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled, "I'm her bodyguard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe looked disappointed and said, "Lila, because of a bodyguard, you don't even want to see Mr. Walsh. What can a bodyguard give you? What's wrong with you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Walsh is the heir to Royal Entertainment. As long as you can establish a relationship with him, no matter what the cost, it will be of great benefit to your career. The bodyguard is nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can always hire another bodyguard if you lose him, but meeting Mr. Walsh concerns your future!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila said, "Chloe, I am satisfied with my life now. I don't have ambitions as you do. I just want to gain a foothold in the entertainment industry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe sighed, "Lila, we are friends, so I suggest you seize the opportunity. In the entertainment industry, competition is brutal. If you don't seize the opportunity, you will be eliminated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't meet Mr. Walsh today, you will regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, a girl with a delicate face and wearing a light-colored dress came from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a friend of Chloe and also a popular star, Lucy Richardson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucy glanced at Lila and Marcus and said to Chloe, "Chloe, Mr. Walsh wants you to come over. We may take a photo with Mr. Walsh later. Hurry up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe failed to persuade Lila but refused to give up. "Lila doesn't want to go. I'm persuading her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucy was surprised, then smiled, "Chloe, why are you doing that? Maybe Lila thinks she is famous enough and does not need Mr. Walsh's support. I heard that Lila has always been self-righteous. It is indeed, as the rumors say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chloe, come with me. Mr. Walsh is still waiting for us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing what Lucy said, Chloe nodded reluctantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe said to Lila, "Lila, if you want to meet Mr. Walsh later, I'll talk to him. He just asked to see you, so don't worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe and Lucy walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila could vaguely hear Lucy's voice. "It turns out Lila's in love with a bodyguard. Interesting. I am surprised. She's dating a poor bodyguard and refuses to meet the heir to Royal Entertainment. What's wrong with her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard that Ross is the heir to Royal Entertainment and has a high status in the entertainment industry. Will you regret not meeting him because of me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked Lila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila shook her head firmly and said, "No. I signed with Stellar Entertainment and don't need to meet Ross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just leave the opportunity to others."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila's words won Marcus' respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Stellar Entertainment was a far cry from Royal Entertainment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Royal Entertainment was a major player in the entertainment industry, while Stellar Entertainment was just a small entertainment company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Marcus took over Stellar Entertainment, it had only produced a few actors of average fame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Royal Entertainment made many superstars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given the circumstances, Lila's firm refusal to meet Ross was surprising.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The ceremony is about to begin. Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that</span><span>, Marcus became more determined to make Lila famous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila nodded and went to the banquet hall of the Golden Hotel with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The banquet hall was magnificent and gathered most of the stars in the Uswad entertainment industry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hall was filled with the sound of cameras snapping, the clatter of goblets, and the laughter of some female celebrities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today's award ceremony was one of the three most important award ceremonies in the Uswad entertainment industry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, all the famous stars attended in their best attire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, most of the stars gathered around a young man in a white suit.</span></p><div class="pagination">
