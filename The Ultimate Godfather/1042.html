        <h1>Chapter 945 A Headshot!-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dare offend Mr. Death? I will kill you today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Miles began to punch and kick Selena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Based on what he had done to Marcus earlier, it was clear that Marcus would never forgive him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t expected </span><span>Selena to add fuel to the fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he almost wanted to kill her himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Selena screamed in pain, never imagining that Miles would be so brutal toward her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking out his anger on Selena, Miles knelt in front of Marcus again, continuing to beg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Marcus didn't even bother to look at him. He said, "You've </span><span>worked for</span><span> Royal Entertainment for many years, but from what I know, you haven't contributed anything. Instead, you've been like a leech, embezzling funds, accepting bribes, and using your position for personal gain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Royal Entertainment doesn't need someone like you. And on top of that, you tried to kill me. That's something that can never be forgiven!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Marcus turned his back, refusing to even glance at Miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miles fell into utter despair. He knew that today he had hit a dead end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His ignorance and arrogance had led him to offend the wrong person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he thought about his inevitable end, anger and frustration consumed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That anger quickly turned into hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, Miles suddenly stood up and grabbed a handgun from one of the bodyguards, attempting to shoot Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miles was certainly </span><span>not </span><span>a man</span><span> that went down without a fight</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Marcus had taken everything from him, he would rather die with Marcus than live in disgrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could pull the trigger, another gunshot rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sniper's bullet pierced through Miles' temple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a powerful impact, his head exploded, and the remnants of his skull and flesh scattered everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The smell of blood immediately filled the air, sending many in the room retreating in fear, their faces pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected that the once-glorious Executive Vice President of Royal Entertainment, Miles, would meet such a brutal end, shot in the head by a sniper's rifle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a horrific, tragic death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Selena was so terrified that her face turned pale, especially when she saw Miles' headless corpse. She let out a scream and curled up on the ground, feeling a hot stream surge from her groin. She was so frightened that she actually wet herself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>You</span><span> </span><span>guys clean it up</span><span>. </span><span>I</span><span>'</span><span>m leaving</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said, uninterested in Selena's plight, as he spoke to Evander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evander, equally shocked by the bloody scene, managed to force a smile and nodded at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, the award for Best Female Singer of the Year goes to Chloe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before leaving, Marcus remind</span><span>ed</span><span> Evander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This brought a warm feeling to Chloe's heart, and she hurriedly followed him, saying, "Wait for me. I'll go with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at Chloe and teased, "You're the Best Female Singer of the Year. Don't you want to stay and accept your award?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe blushed and replied, "Those awards are just titles. The truly remarkable people, like you, know when to strike</span><span> </span><span>and when to hold back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After witnessing what just happened, Chloe's mindset seemed to change in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She became much more mature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before this, she had been extremely determined to win the award for Best Female Singer of the Year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had even been willing to confront Miles head-on for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after witnessing </span><span>what </span><span>Marcus</span><span> had done</span><span>, Chloe suddenly saw through many things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She no longer cared as much about such hollow titles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The truly</span><span> power</span><span>ful</span><span> don't </span><span>care too much about</span><span> fame.</span><span> They</span><span> focus on what's inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If </span><span>some</span><span>one is </span><span>strong</span><span> enough, even without those so-called titles, they can still stand out and make a name for themselves.</span></p></div>
