Isn't there anything wrong with having lunch together?" Marcus replied with a dismissive wave and a warm smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecilia gazed at Marcus, her bright blue eyes reflecting her admiration for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had suffered a sudden attack from her congenital heart condition on </span><span>Solomia</span><span> Street that day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcus hadn't provided immediate medical attention, she might have met her maker right then and there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of this, Cecilia regarded Marcus as something of a second parent, someone who had given her a second chance at life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus ordered several of </span><span>Solomia's</span><span> signature dishes as lunch progressed for Cecilia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being from </span><span>Acoton</span><span>, her dietary preferences were utterly different from those of the </span><span>Uswadian</span><span> people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after tasting Marcus' selected dishes, Cecilia couldn't stop singing her praises.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They chatted about various topics throughout their meal, and their rapport grew naturally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their initial formality had melted away, and they even shared a few jokes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' wit had Cecilia covering her mouth as she laughed, clearly having the time of her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She found herself increasingly drawn to this charming man's magnetic personality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several men dressed in black suits burst through the restaurant door at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These men were tall and muscular, with typical Weston Land features. They exuded an intimidating aura that filled the room with a palpable sense of danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecilia's face darkened at their sudden appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could even stand up to speak, the leader&mdash;a man with a ponytail and a small goatee&mdash;pressed a gun against her head!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simultaneously, two other men stepped forward and drew their weapons, training them on Marcus!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell do you think you're doing?" Cecilia </span><span>demanded,</span><span> her face ashen with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man with the ponytail let out a cold laugh. "My apologies, Ms. McHale, but we're </span><span>following Mr. Joel McHale's orders. He wants us to bring you back to </span><span>Acoton</span><span>. We're just following instructions, so please don't take it personally!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I came to </span><span>Uswad</span><span> for a business deal!" Cecilia </span><span>snapped,</span><span> her voice as cold as ice. "Why does Uncle Joel want me back, and why resort to these tactics? What's his endgame?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ponytailed man sneered, "Mr. McHale wants Ms. McHale to witness his inauguration as the new CEO of McHale Pharmaceuticals Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, Ms. McHale, you won't need to worry about matters related to McHale Pharmaceuticals Group. You can go back to being the family's privileged daughter!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecilia's face darkened at these words, and she coldly questioned the speaker, "I am the sole heir to the CEO position of McHale Pharmaceuticals Group. How dare Uncle Joel pull such underhanded tricks while I'm away in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>? Does he not fear my grandfather's retribution?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecilia's grandfather, Rhett McHale, was the head of McHale Pharmaceuticals Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to his advanced age, he planned to appoint Cecilia as his successor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the intricate power dynamics within McHale Pharmaceuticals Group made transitioning leadership to Cecilia smoothly challenging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the opposition, Cecilia's second uncle Joel had been eyeing the CEO position with barely concealed ambition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rhett had long recognized Joel's ruthless nature and overwhelming greed, which made him unfit for leadership.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why he had always groomed Cecilia as his successor to lead the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no one expected Joel to stage a family coup while Cecilia was away in </span><span>Uswad</span><span> on a business negotiation!</span></p><div class="pagination">
