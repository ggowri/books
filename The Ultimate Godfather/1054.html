        <h1>Chapter 954 Can We Start?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't help but stare&mdash;Chloe's figure was a knockout, lighting up his eyes the second he took it in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was what he'd pictured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slim, almost fragile-looking, but with curves up top that packed a punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She reminded him of Gertie&mdash;same vibe&mdash;but Chloe was even skinnier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The difference was in the skin. Gertie's glowed with a rosy flush, screaming health, while Chloe's was a stark, icy white, the kind that hinted at something off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Probably tied to that chill she carried inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe caught the heat in his gaze, her cheeks flaring redder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She instinctively clapped a hand over her chest, shielding that snowy cleavage like she wasn't ready for him to see it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus just grinned, unfazed. "Never would've guessed a frame that tiny could look this good. Dead on with what I figured."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shot him a look. "What, you've been sizing me up this whole time? You got X-ray vision or something?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd hit the nail on the head&mdash;Marcus did have X-ray vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But out of respect, he hadn't peeked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was all gut instinct, years of knowing how bodies ticked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not wrong&mdash;I've got the eyes for it," he said, chuckling. "And why cover up? Good things are meant to be seen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beyond that plunging neckline, her flat stomach and curvy waist were just as tempting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her skin practically shimmered with youth, smooth enough to bounce a quarter off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Add a touch of color to that pale glow, and she'd be flawless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way I'm that perfect," Chloe mumbled, squirming under the praise. "I'm just a regular girl." Still, she eased her hand down, letting that deep, white valley peek out again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One glance and Marcus was hooked, his eyes glued to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe felt it, shrinking back onto the bed with a shy fidget. "Can we start?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pull your pants down a bit&mdash;show me all of your stomach. Makes it easier to work," Marcus said, keeping it matter-of-fact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe bit her lip, wishing the floor would swallow her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was already in low-rise jeans&mdash;stripping the tee had left them riding dangerously low.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any further, and she'd be flashing more than she bargained for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus kept nudging, so she complied, inching the waistband down bit by bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stopped when the edge of her dark hairline crept into view, barely there against her pale skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Little more," Marcus prompted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sighed and tugged again, exposing the top of that shadowy patch&mdash;enough to hint at the curve below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was her first time baring this much to a guy, and her face burned, heart hammering. "Is this okay now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded, satisfied with the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That glimpse of her lower half tugged at something in him, though&mdash;sparse, light-brown wisps against her icy skin, a strange, striking kind of beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with his focus on healing, that primal itch stirred, itching to explore. He shoved it down hard. Taking advantage wasn't his style, and fixing her was the priority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, what're you looking at?" Chloe's voice quivered, catching the heat in his stare, her heart pounding like a drum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing&mdash;just brace yourself. This might feel weird," he said, dodging the awkwardness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gave a nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right then, Marcus fired up his Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Strands of Timeless Numinous Energy swirled in his palm, and he pressed it gently against her smooth stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The touch hit her like a jolt&mdash;her whole body quivered, a tingling rush spreading fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the energy poured in, that buzz cranked up, electric and wild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt like she'd been zapped, every nerve buzzing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deeper it sank, the more it messed with her&mdash;something raw and unnamable bubbling up inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soft whimpers slipped out, impossible to hold back, while her stomach warmed, a hot current slamming her senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It crept lower, teasing nerves she didn't know could fire like that, leaving her slick and restless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah&mdash;" A breathy moan escaped, her face flushing deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shot Marcus a flustered glance, almost accusing. "What're you doing to me? Why does it feel so intense?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He caught the shift in her, keeping his tone steady. "Just healing you. Hang in there&mdash;it's normal to feel some reactions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timeless Numinous Energy had a knack for this&mdash;especially with women, stirring up urges no matter how chaste they were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had seen it before. Even the primmest types turned wild under its pull.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't thrilled about it&mdash;didn't know why the Grimoire packed that punch&mdash;but it was what it was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe peeked down, seeing his hand planted firmly on her stomach, no funny business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She exhaled, sinking back onto the bed, steeling herself for more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as Marcus pumped in more energy, that restless itch inside her spiked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Heat flooded her core, each pulse hitting like a live wire, yanking moans she couldn't stifle&mdash;low, needy sounds that filled the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body squirmed, every sensitive spot crawling with a maddening itch, craving something she couldn't name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It built until she was soaked, her panties clinging, a faint, sweet scent rising up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That empty ache down below screamed for relief&mdash;something to fill it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah&mdash;I can't take it," she gasped between moans, pleading. "When's it over? I'm losing it here..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a wreck, desperate under the Grimoire's relentless push, that hollow need begging Marcus to step in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't get it&mdash;years solo, no guys, just the usual daydreams every girl had. But this? This was a hunger she'd never touched, and it freaked her out.</span></p></div>
