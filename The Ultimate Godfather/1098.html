  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Faith instantly became furious upon hearing this, placed her hands on her hips, and snarled, "Looks like you've grown bold, daring to talk to me like that! Let's see if I don't beat you to death!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, she raised her hand, ready to strike Morgana again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, just as her palm was about to fall, a strong hand suddenly grabbed her wrist, forcefully pressing her arm down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Faith was momentarily stunned, then turned to look at Marcus. A mocking smile immediately appeared at the corner of her mouth as she gritted her teeth and said, "So this is why you suddenly don't want to give me money? Turns out you've hooked up with a man! Come on, tell me, are you planning to spend all the money on him and leave me with nothing? You really are shameless!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Faith insult Marcus, Morgana's anger flared even more. She retorted loudly, "Marcus is my boyfriend. And he's very wealthy, he doesn't need to live off my salary. Stop spouting nonsense here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tsk tsk!" Faith looked Marcus up and down, then sneered at Morgana, "So you've learned to play this game too, finding a man to rely on. And this guy looks pretty strong&mdash;does he make you enjoy yourself? Otherwise, why would you be so willing to spend money on him?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Faith's words becoming more outrageous, Morgana grew so angry that she couldn't help but shed tears.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as she was about to speak, Marcus suddenly slapped Faith hard across the face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Faith let out a scream and was knocked to the ground by Marcus, wailing in pain, "How dare you hit me? I'll fight you to the end!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Faith staggered to her feet and lunged fiercely at Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had been domineering her whole life and had never suffered a loss. Especially when it came to fighting, with her massive build and aggressive demeanor, ordinary people would feel intimidated just at the sight of her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Marcus stood his ground and kicked her in the stomach before Faith could get close.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a dull thud, Faith screamed again and fell to the ground, her cries growing more piercing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Watch your mouth. As long as I'm here, you won't get to act wild!" Marcus stared coldly at Faith on the ground, his tone icy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had already gotten a general understanding of what happened from their conversation in the room earlier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt deep disgust and revulsion toward people who expect rewards without giving anything in return.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Faith was not only like that but also so overbearing and shameless it was downright nauseating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Faith roared, "Morgana, how dare you let your man hit me! Do you know who my man is? Just you wait, both of you! Today, I'll make sure to break one of his arms and have him kneel before me to apologize!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And you, pretending to be some college professor? I'll make sure to sell you off as a prostitute so you can see what you're really worth."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Faith struggled to get up from the ground, hysterically roaring at Morgana and Marcus, her voice so loud it even drew out quite a few neighbors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Faith coming around asking for money again, everyone scolded her for being shameless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Morgana was little, Faith abused her and took over her property. Now, shamelessly asking her for money is just too much.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, I'd love to know who your man is. Go get him now, I'll be waiting downstairs!" Marcus sneered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before he could finish speaking, Faith wobbled downstairs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Morgana looked at Marcus apologetically and said, "Marcus, sorry for the trouble, I really feel bad about this."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus smiled slightly and said, "You're my woman, why say such things to me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, he gently stroked Morgana's swollen cheek and asked with concern, "Does it hurt?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Morgana shook her head and said, "It doesn't hurt anymore."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, she felt a warm current from Marcus's palm slowly seep into her skin, quickly easing the previous burning pain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, her swollen cheek returned to normal, which amazed her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before she could react, Marcus had already strode downstairs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Morgana said with concern, "Hey, Marcus, are you really going? I heard her new man is from the underworld. You better not go. I'm afraid you</span><span>'</span><span>ll get into unnecessary trouble."</span></p><div class="pagination">
