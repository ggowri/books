  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia nodded gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having obtained Nadia's consent, Marcus once again activated the Timeless Warrior's </span><span>Grimoire and once more placed his hand upon her lower abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment his hand made contact with Nadia, she let out a sharp cry. Instantly, her face flushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sensation was not foreign to Nadia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her prior dream, she had already experienced the exquisite feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That deep-seated stimulation brought Nadia an unparalleled sense of pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia exerted every effort to maintain control, yet the intense pleasure was overwhelming, causing her to emit soft moans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She dared not meet Marcus' gaze directly and softly inquired, "What are you doing? Why am I experiencing this wonderful feeling?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus responded, "I'm merely treating you. Don't misinterpret my actions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia seemed somewhat skeptical. She propped herself up slightly and saw that Marcus indeed had only one hand touching her lower abdomen, making no additional movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This dispelled the doubts in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, her intense pleasure persisted and grew even stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Nadia could no longer endure it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gasped raggedly, her skin flushing a deep crimson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of her hands instinctively reached for her breast, beginning to gently knead it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's happening? Why am I feeling so uncomfortable?" Nadia continued to make alluring sounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus infused an even more potent stream of Timeless Numinous Energy into her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia was immediately overwhelmed by the pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, she felt as if she were experiencing an orgasm, her rationality slipping away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stimulating sensation coursed rapidly through her body, causing her lower body to become moist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia was consumed by an unprecedented pleasure, as if she had lost all awareness, her mind a complete blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh..." Nadia murmured involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the dream, she had been desperately longing for an orgasm but had awakened at that precise moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Nadia was filled with deep disappointment, even harboring a desire to slip back into the dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never anticipated that she would experience this feeling in reality, and it was even more vivid and exhilarating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the intense wave of happiness subsided, although Nadia had experienced profound pleasure, she soon felt a sense of emptiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body subtly opened, as if yearning to be filled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't bear the feeling of emptiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I feel so wretched. Why am I feeling like this? When will the treatment end?" Nadia looked at Marcus, asking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was flushed, and her beautiful eyes were brimming with longing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her one hand continued to knead her breast, while her other hand roamed across her skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia's hand reached her lower body, and she began to rub it involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When her finger grazed her clitoris, Nadia's body convulsed suddenly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This area was replete with sensitive nerves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This simple touch sent Nadia, already in the throes of desire, into a second orgasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed even more intense than the previous one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia let out rapid, sharp cries, her body spasming as if she had been struck by an electric current.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A copious amount of liquid seeped from her lower body, soaking through her pink panties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus felt a rush of excitement upon seeing this, but he couldn't afford to be distracted. This was a critical phase of the treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only fully engage the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, infusing an even more refined and concentrated stream of Timeless Numinous Energy into Nadia's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This subjected Nadia to an even more intense stimulation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her waist undulated rhythmically, and her hands seemed inadequate to satisfy her needs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of Marcus, she inserted her hand into her panties, sliding it back and forth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each movement brought her pleasure, quickly pushing Nadia towards another orgasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Nadia went limp, as if she had lost consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus finally completed the treatment after infusing an even stronger stream of Timeless Numinous Energy into Nadia's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the Cursed Power within Nadia's body was completely eradicated, and her previously damaged organs were fully restored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the removal of the Cursed Power, Nadia's potential seemed to be fully unlocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cultivation level soared directly to the equivalent of a human Ancient Martial Stage Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This level was already on par with Elliott's, demonstrating the vast potential of the Nuer Tribe members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If not for the Cursed Power, the overall strength of the Nuer Tribe would increase significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By Marcus' estimation, perhaps no force in the human world could match the Nuer Tribe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This led Marcus to increasingly believe that the Nuer Tribe did not belong to the world within the Ice Wall in </span><span>Morvalis</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Nadia was only 18 years old this year. Her future potential was boundless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After concluding the treatment, Marcus withdrew the Timeless Numinous Energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intense pleasure vanished. This jolted Nadia back to awareness, and she asked Marcus, "Is the treatment over?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to her earlier impatience, Nadia's inquiry now held a tinge of reluctance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded and replied, "Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Nadia felt an even deeper sense of disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recalling the actions she had taken in front of Marcus, she was overcome with </span><span>shyness and dared not look at him directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rushed into the bathroom. Moments later, the sound of running water filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five minutes later, Nadia emerged from the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had donned a brand-new dress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus then noticed that Nadia's figure was as flawless as Susan's, and her skin was exquisite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing there casually, Nadia's beauty was simply captivating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is my illness cured?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a shower, Nadia managed to shake off the previous sense of shame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt that all her previous pain and discomfort had completely vanished, and she asked Marcus in astonishment.</span></p><div class="pagination">
