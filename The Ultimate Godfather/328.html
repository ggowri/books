        <h1>Chapter 327 Emma's Arrogance</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After freshening up, Marcus booked a train ticket, preparing to head downstairs to catch a taxi to the station for his return to Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, halfway through the ride, his taxi was abruptly blocked by a convoy of vehicles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus frowned slightly and stepped out of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The taxi driver, not wanting to get involved, sped off immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Standing in front of Marcus were Emma and several Rivera Construction Group personnel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well, well, Marcus. I bet you didn't expect to see me again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma sneered, her gaze filled with arrogance and satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What do you want to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus narrowed his eyes slightly, surprised that it was Emma who had intercepted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What do I want? You put my uncle in prison, so I'm here for your life. Once you're dead, we'll be even!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma's gaze suddenly became sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While speaking, she waved her hand to the men at a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tony, leading a group of Black Tiger Gang members wielding machetes, stepped forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tony, break his limbs, grind his body into pulp, and feed him to the fish! Only then will I be satisfied!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma gritted her teeth and barked the order at Tony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tony smirked, "Ms. Rivera, don't worry. You pay, and I deliver. This guy's a dead man today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He waved to his men beside him while talking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Understanding his order, the Black Tiger Gang lackeys prepared to charge at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But just as they moved, one of the tattooed gang members hurriedly stepped forward to block them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Vito, we can't do this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tony was stunned and asked impatiently, "What the hell is wrong with you? Why are you hesitating?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Vito, look at this man. This guy... I think he's Mr. Fitzgerald..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The tattooed man stammered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tony's body froze as if struck by lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, he got a good look at Marcus' face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tony, what are you waiting for? Kill this guy already!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma naturally didn't know the relationship between Tony and Marcus. She was annoyed at the delay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without hesitation, Tony delivered a resounding slap across Emma's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It split her lip and left her stunned. Emma shouted in disbelief, "Tony! Are you insane? Why did you hit me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Shut up, you stupid woman! If you speak again, I'll kill you myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tony roared before turning to Marcus and bowing to him. "Mr. Fitzgerald, we meet again so soon..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tony trembled with fear when he said this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had seen Marcus' terrifying strength personally. Even if given ten thousand chances, Tony wouldn't dare provoke him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Mark, that old fool, had sent me to kill Marcus. It's practically pushing me into a fiery pit of death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And this little wretch standing here is no better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What a coincidence. We meet again so soon," Marcus said, his face calm and unreadable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was this very expression that sent chills through Tony's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He vividly remembered Marcus wearing the same look when he killed that Ancient Martial Stage Two master at the port.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I didn't know it was you. Otherwise, I wouldn't dare to bother you even if I had a hundred lives. Don't be angry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tony pleaded and bowed in front of him, constantly slapping himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The scene left Emma utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tony, the notorious Black Tiger Gang boss, the ruler of the region's underground world, was groveling at Marcus' feet, utterly humiliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What shocked her even more was that she had previously investigated Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was primarily based in Solomia and rarely appeared in Solariae.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How could she have known his reach already extended here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Forget it. You didn't know. Get up," Marcus said dismissively, waving a hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tony exhaled deeply as though receiving a divine pardon. He immediately stood up and asked Marcus, "Mr. Fitzgerald, what should I do with this bitch? Just say the word, and I'll handle it however you want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus replied casually, "It's up to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tony's face lit up with a sinister gleam of understanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma was undeniably beautiful, and Tony had long harbored thoughts about her but had never dared act on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He really wanted to act on them. Still, a flicker of doubt lingered. Emma was Mark Rivera's daughter, after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he acted, Mark would undoubtedly retaliate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Rest assured. Rivera Construction Group will cease to exist tomorrow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus gave him a gaze to reassure him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If anyone else had made such a statement, Tony would have dismissed it as boastful nonsense. But Marcus had spoken, and Tony believed it without question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His gaze fell on Emma, lingering with unabashed greed. Tony grabbed Emma forcefully and dragged her toward the nearby business van.</span></p></div>
