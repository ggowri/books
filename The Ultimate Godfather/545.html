        <h1>Chapter 544 Losing Everything</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll outshine Lila in no time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila's face instantly darkened. She hadn't expected Edmund to be still arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina, on the other hand, couldn't contain her excitement. She suddenly kissed Edmund on the cheek in front of everyone, her voice sweet as she said, "Mr. Cross, I can't thank you enough! I'll make sure to show you a great performance tonight..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was even a hint of shyness in her expression as she spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund smiled smugly. "Good. I'll be looking forward to it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then quickly dialed a number from his phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as the call connected, Marcus' phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't say anything at first, just waiting for the other person to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a beat, the phone was answered, and suddenly, Edmund's entire demeanor changed. His face turned respectful. "Hello, is this Mr. Death? I'm Edmund, the president of Stellar Entertainment. It's a pleasure to know you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, Mr. Death, why aren't you speaking? This is Edmund," he repeated, his voice now tinged with confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Death, can you hear me?" He was starting to sound a little anxious now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was about to hang up and try again, but then Marcus spoke up. "If you've got something to say, come say it to my face. No need to call me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, no one could quite process what had just happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, someone in the crowd whispered, "Wait... from the way he's talking, could he actually be the one Edmund was mentioning?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impossible! This can't be real. This guy not only knows the vice president of Sync Group and the Burnett family, but he also bought Stellar Entertainment? There's no way someone that powerful is him. I don't believe it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund scoffed, unable to hide his sarcasm. "What are you pretending for? You? Mr. Death? You're way out of your league."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He ended the call and redialed, but this time, when Marcus answered, he was ready. "I told you to speak to me face-to-face, not over the phone. Why didn't you listen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund froze, his mind spinning. The voice was all too familiar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes widened in disbelief, and his body seemed to tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Y-You... are you really Mr. Death?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd went dead silent. No one could believe what they had just heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina, still stunned, leaned in and asked urgently, "Mr. Cross, what did you say? I didn't catch that. Could you repeat it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund's voice was shaky as he explained, "I said... he's Mr. Death! He bought Stellar Entertainment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina's heart skipped a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought in disbelief, "What? How is that even possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bought Stellar Entertainment? Who... who is this guy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila was equally stunned. She could hardly believe her ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Death, now that you've acquired Stellar Entertainment, I'm at your disposal. "I'd like to keep my position as president. After all, no one knows the company better than I do," Edmund said, his voice no longer the arrogant tone it had been just moments before. Instead, it was drenched with fawning humility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason for his sudden change was simple. He had already lost Stellar Entertainment, and he didn't want to lose his job too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't need someone like you. You're fired. Get out immediately. And as for the woman in front of you, I don't ever want to see her again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had no intention of giving Edmund any opportunity. He had acquired Stellar Entertainment just to humiliate him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words hit Edmund like a punch to the gut, and for a moment, he stood frozen in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had built Stellar Entertainment from the ground up, and now it was gone. His title, his status, and his empire were all taken away in an instant. He was nobody now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crushing blow left him reeling, his mind spinning. The weight of it all made him dizzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes narrowed with fury, and his voice became low, menacing. "You think you can strip everything away from me, huh? Fine. I'll remember this. We'll see who has the last laugh."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Edmund spun on his heel, storming off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina, who had once believed she could climb to the top of the entertainment world by hitching her future to Edmund, now found her dreams shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had thought that by using his connections, she could easily knock Lila off her pedestal and become the next big star.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in a cruel twist of fate, she had barely tasted the rewards of her ambition before everything crumbled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And with Edmund's downfall, the rumors about her involvement with him would soon spread like wildfire, destroying any hope she had of a clean image.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her career, once on the rise, now seemed destined for collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reluctantly, she followed Edmund out of the room, the weight of the situation settling heavily on her shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd, still in shock, murmured among themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could have predicted that the once unstoppable Edmund would fall so </span><span>dramatically all because he had crossed the wrong person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Marcus looked unremarkable at first glance, he had the power to make the vice president of Sync Group show him utmost respect with just a phone call.</span></p></div>
