        <h1>Chapter 736 Is He Even Human?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air was thick with the acrid stench of charred flesh, making the Swords Sect experts feel as if death itself had descended upon them. The arrogance in their gazes was gone, replaced by sheer terror as they looked at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We... we were blind to your greatness earlier and offended you. Please, show mercy," one of the Swords Sect experts, a peak Ancient Martial Stage Six expert, stepped </span><span>forward and pleaded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, it was painfully clear to him that this young man before them wasn't someone they could afford to provoke. Even if they joined forces, they wouldn't stand a chance against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus let out a cold chuckle, his mocking gaze sweeping over the trembling man. "I already gave you two chances, but you chose to squander them. And now you beg for mercy when you realize you're no match for me? Do you think that will work?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beads of cold sweat dripped down the man's forehead. Bowing deeply, he stammered, "Didn't you say Mr. Sky once extended an invitation to you? For his sake, please let this matter go. The Swords Sect will forever be in your debt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' lips curled into a sneer. "Apologies, but Mr. Sky's goodwill was already used up. As for you&mdash;your time is up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the man could react, Marcus flicked his finger, and a beam of destructive light shot forth from his fingertips. It streaked across the space between them in an instant, like it was slicing through the fabric of reality itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The expert's face turned ashen as he tried to dodge, but before he could even move, an invisible force locked him in place. His body froze, helplessly pinned like an insect caught in amber. His allies watched in desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sickening squelch, the beam pierced through the man's forehead. His body went rigid, and his wide eyes filled with disbelief. "You... you're an Ancient Martial Stage Nine expert." Those were his final words before his lifeless body collapsed to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An Ancient Martial Stage Nine expert? Impossible... When did the </span><span>Uswad</span><span> martial art world ever have someone so powerful?" The remaining Swords Sect members were even more horrified after hearing their comrade's last words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their gazes at Marcus were filled with utter dread, as though staring into the eyes of the Grim Reaper himself. His strength was overwhelming, killing them as effortlessly as swatting flies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing they had no chance, the remaining experts scattered in a desperate bid to flee. But Marcus wasn't about to let them go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Magical energy surged around him, and bolts of lightning descended from the heavens with destructive force. Each strike carried devastating power, obliterating the fleeing experts one by one. In the end, their bodies burst into clouds of blood mist, drifting away on the wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every Swords Sect expert who had come to kill him was now wiped out. Marcus hadn't intended to make an enemy of the Swords Sect. Considering Liam's relationship with him, he was willing to let the matter slide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But these people had pushed their luck, refusing to back down and insisting on his death. Since they sought their demise, he saw no reason to show mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After collecting their Spatial Rings, Marcus walked back to the car parked nearby. Opening the door, he got in. Earlier, he had placed Runes from the Heavenly Circle Diagram around the car, completely isolating it from the battle outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the vehicle, Chloe sat quietly, fiddling with her phone, completely unaware of the carnage that had just unfolded. Glancing over, Marcus noticed she was texting </span><span>Lila on WhatsApp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she saw </span><span>Marcus</span><span> return, Chloe put down her phone and asked, "What happened? Are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled faintly, "I'm fine. Let me take you home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe nodded lightly and thought, "He has said earlier that he had to go kill someone, but now he is back so quickly. It almost felt like he has been joking." That thought eased her mind, and she didn't dwell on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, the rain poured down in torrents, the sound of water drumming against the roof of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe, however, failed to notice that when Marcus got in, his clothes were completely dry&mdash;untouched by the rain. It wasn't until much later that night, after she'd showered, removed her makeup, and lay in bed, that the realization struck her like a bolt of lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body tensed, and she abruptly sat up in bed. "The rain was coming down in sheets. How did he stay dry? Is he... is he even human?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A shiver ran down her spine as her thoughts spiraled, and she instinctively pulled the blanket over her head. But then she recalled seeing Marcus' shadow under the streetlights. "No... He has a shadow. He can't be a ghost."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, the image of Marcus standing bone-dry in the pouring rain shook her deeply. That night, Chloe tossed and turned, unable to sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, after dropping Chloe off, Marcus drove to the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>. He made his way to the presidential suite and knocked on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A gruff, impatient voice came from inside. "What the hell? Can't you see I'm busy?" Over the voice, the faint sound of a woman's moans could be heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Walsh, I've delivered Chloe as instructed. I checked&mdash;she's still a virgin," Marcus replied calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, the voice inside grew noticeably more excited. "Good. Wait a moment,"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heavy, armored door of the suite soon creaked open, revealing Zachary's aged face, flushed and sweaty, evidence of his recent activities. "Where is she?" Zachary asked eagerly, scanning behind Marcus for Chloe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus ignored his question, stepping into the suite and locking the door behind him. The room was luxurious, with expansive floor-to-ceiling windows offering a breathtaking view of </span><span>Solomia's</span><span> glittering nightscape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the large white bed lay a stunningly beautiful woman, completely naked. Her flushed cheeks and labored breaths suggested she had been thoroughly indulging Zachary's appetites.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus recognized her instantly&mdash;it was Lucy, the aspiring country music star he had met at a recent party. Unlike Lila, who had already risen to fame as the queen of country music, Lucy was always stuck in her shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her envy had festered, driving her to seek powerful backers to surpass Lila and claim the title of the new country music queen. Her desperation had led her to Ross. After Ross' humiliating encounter with Marcus, it seemed Lucy had shifted her ambitions to Ross' grandfather, Zachary.</span></p></div>
