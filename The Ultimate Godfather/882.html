  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well..." Marcus couldn't feel more embarrassed at this moment after being seen through by Maxine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, she actually knew his whereabouts, which made him feel really bad </span><span>about failing to fool her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he figured out that it was a piece of cake for the heiress of the Burnett family and top student of </span><span>Solomia</span><span> Police Academy to find out whatever she wanted to know with so many resources at her disposal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't wrong you, did I? You would like to spend time with other girls except for me, right?" Maxine said with a sneer like a desolated wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are you now? I'll go there," said Marcus after taking a deep breath and </span><span>said</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His only way out now was to console this firecracker in person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm at your door," Maxine said with displeasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on a second."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Here was another thing that blew his mind: Maxine rushed to the Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that the anxiety of not seeing Marcus for so long time drove her a little crazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Marcus got himself well-dressed and adjusted his hair before walking out of the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first person he saw after going outside was none other than Maxine in a neat police uniform that made her look brave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, under the dull police uniform was her sexy figure. Her radiant face seemed as shiny as the sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shining in the bright sunshine, Maxine looked like a piece of art, stunning and gorgeous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Long time no see, Officer Burnett," said Marcus when he stepped forward to hold Maxine in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his surprise, she dodged him in disgust and let him hug the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can say hello with your mouth, not your arms," Maxine said with a glare at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But that's what we used to do. Why can't it work today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While saying that, Marcus looked up and down at Maxine's body and finally fixed his eyes on her big boobs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She vaguely noticed his burning gaze and felt a little timid as her brain replayed the closeness they once had against her will.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her delicate face began to blush as she pretended to be tough. "You have no reason to hug me; it's not like we're lovers. I'm saving you trouble from being troubled by my boyfriend in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was stunned for a moment and said, "You have a boyfriend? Congratulations."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was a lie she made up to elicit jealousy from Marcus but pissed her off instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was so irritated by his indifference and turned her head away from him while pouting her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first reaction this man had after hearing her comment on her future boyfriend was to congratulate her without any frustration or opposition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such indifference highly indicated that he didn't care about who she was going to date or marry at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, why are you so mad? Are you not happy about being congratulated?" Marcus paced in front of her and asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine couldn't help but punch his chest. "Will you still be so apathetic when I marry </span><span>someone else? Or do I mean nothing to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While saying that, Maxine gazed at Marcus with her fascinating eyes to figure out what he was thinking about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus let out a bitter smile and said, "Who am I to interfere in your life? I'm not your boyfriend anyway."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When saying this, he deliberately shrugged his shoulders with a helpless look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This question left Maxine speechless because he was right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although they had crossed the line of friendship, "friend" was the only word they could use to describe each other since they had never had sex or confessed to each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that case, Marcus indeed had no right to prevent her from seeing someone else.</span></p><div class="pagination">
