  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing," Marcus replied quickly, shaking his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana flashed a captivating smile. "Are you too scared to admit it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you trying to provoke me?" His gaze roamed unabashedly over her alluring figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "And if I am? What would you dare to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's expression darkened, her cool demeanor returning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, as she looked at Marcus' powerful physique, her heart fluttered unexpectedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see if I really dare," Marcus said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a swift motion, Marcus swept her up into his arms. Diana gasped, her heart racing, and instinctively, she closed her eyes, anticipating what might come next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as she thought something was about to happen, he gently set her back down. "It's late. You should get some rest. I'll just take a shower and head to my room."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't want to push her into anything she wasn't ready for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Disappointment flickered in Diana's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a quick shower, Marcus began to channel the energy from the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following the ancient incantations, a powerful surge of Numinous Energy flowed through his veins, circulating in a grand cycle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the energy coursed through him, Marcus watched in astonishment as his wounds healed at an almost visible rate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just half an hour, all his injuries had vanished, his bronze skin glowing with a faint luminescence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who knew the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire had healing properties!" he marveled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, Marcus retrieved the Fire Elemental Power Crystal, ready to refine it using the techniques outlined in the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he focused on the crystal, the process of refinement began. Once he completed it, Marcus found himself wielding fire energy with a potency far surpassing what Falcon had managed with the same crystal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The destructive power at his fingertips was terrifying! He realized that there were many other elemental powers in the world, each with its own crystals. If he could harness more of these elemental stones, his strength would undoubtedly reach new heights!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning dawned bright and early, marking the day Marcus would officially start at Golden Group as the chairman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a hearty breakfast, he hopped into his sleek Alphard van, the perfect choice for transporting his adoptive parents later that afternoon to help them find a new home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he even reached the office, Felix and Abigail swaggered through the entrance of the company headquarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Yannis, are you sure I can get into Golden Group?" Abigail asked through Felix's with a sweet, innocent tone, looping her arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix nodded confidently. "Of course! You're my wife. What's difficult about getting you into the company?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail's eyes flickered with uncertainty. "That's not what I meant. I was talking about Marcus. He appointed Michelle as the general manager, and you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A menacing glint flashed in Felix's eyes as he cut her off with a sneer. "Have you forgotten? Mr. Wesley sent someone to take care of Marcus yesterday. By now, he should be dead. Mr. Wesley promised me the general manager position is still mine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Abigail relaxed, a satisfied smile spreading across her face. "You're right. That waste of space should be gone. No one in Golden Group would dare defy Mr. Wesley's orders. You will be the general manager!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they spoke, they arrived at the general manager's office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle, who had started even earlier than Marcus, was already busy organizing her workspace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, you little bitch! Don't you see this is the general manager's office? What are you doing barging in here?" Abigail snapped as she spotted Michelle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to face them, Michelle frowned. "I'm the general manager, appointed by Mr. Fitzgerald himself. It's perfectly normal for me to be here. What gives you two the right to act so high and mighty toward me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix let out a mocking laugh, his expression smug. "True, you were appointed by that waste of space, but what if I told you he's dead? Mr. Wesley wants me to take over as general manager!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle's brow furrowed, her heart dropping. "Dead? Are you two sure you're not just making this up? Do you have any evidence?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix waved his hand dismissively. "Evidence? You'll see soon enough. The news will break any minute now. Just wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he strutted over to the general manager's desk, plopping himself into the chair he had long coveted, crossing his legs with a sense of triumph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Abigail switched on the television, tuning into the Solomia news channel. "It's exactly seven o'clock&mdash;perfect timing for the morning news. You better pay attention!" she said, smirking at Michelle.</span></p><div class="pagination">
