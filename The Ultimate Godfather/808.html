        <h1>Chapter 793 Justice Executed-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As heads turned toward the doorway, a group of individuals entered, led by a man wearing a crisp administrative jacket, his hair a dignified gray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He carried himself with an unmistakable air of authority, the kind of presence that demanded attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind him walked several other figures, each exuding a similar aura of influence and prominence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent as every eye locked onto the group, disbelief spreading like wildfire through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's Commander Julian Ashford... He's really here? This has to be a joke, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's him. It's really him. But who on earth is this young man? How could he make a single phone call and summon Commander Ashford?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whispers intensified, with glances darting toward Marcus, their expressions now mixed with shock and a tinge of respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pablo and Arabella looked equally stunned, though their reactions quickly turned to unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stepping forward, Pablo forced a smile. "Father, why are you here? Is there something wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Smack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Pablo could say another word, Julian's hand swung out with precision, delivering a thunderous slap that echoed across the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pablo stumbled, his head snapping to the side. A red, swollen imprint of Julian's hand bloomed instantly across his cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crack of the slap was so sharp, so sudden, that the entire hall seemed to hold its breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every gaze fixated on Julian and </span><span>Pablo,</span><span> the air thick with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nobody had expected Commander Julian Ashford&mdash;a paragon of integrity&mdash;to rush here, let alone to strike his own son so publicly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a sight that completely upended everything the onlookers thought they understood about the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Father, what are you doing? Why would you hit me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pablo's voice cracked with incredulity as he cupped his swollen cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For as long as he could remember, Julian had never raised a hand against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And as Pablo's career had flourished, Julian had only grown more hands-off, trusting him to handle matters independently while quietly positioning him for even greater opportunities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, in front of dozens of witnesses, his father had slapped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was beyond humiliating, as if he were having a bad dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Arabella, usually brimming with confidence, stood frozen in place, her face pale with shock. She couldn't wrap her head around the fact that Julian had just struck Pablo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take a look at what you've done," Julian snapped, his voice sharp as steel, thrusting a printed document into Pablo's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the same file Marcus had sent earlier, the one that had laid bare all of Pablo's questionable actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pablo's hands trembled as he skimmed through the pages, his face darkening with every word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no idea how Julian had gotten his hands on this damning evidence, but panic clawed at him. "Father, this file&mdash;it's fake! Someone's trying to frame me! You can't believe this nonsense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Smack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Pablo could say more, Julian delivered another slap, this one to the opposite side of his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I reviewed every detail of this file on my way here," Julian growled. "Many of these accusations are true, and you know it. Yet you still dare to lie to my face? You've let me down&mdash;completely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pablo fell to his knees, the fight draining from his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice wavered as he stammered, "Father, please... listen to me! I'm your son. You can't believe outsiders over me. Someone's trying to ruin me!"</span></p></div>
