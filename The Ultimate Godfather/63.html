  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After violent sprinting, Marcus finally released his desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane had already passed out. Apart from her body still trembling, she had no response for a short period.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was not surprised because Jane had behaved like this the last time they had sex in the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't woken Jane up, she might have really fallen asleep in the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Jane </span><span>a</span><span>sleep, Marcus did not disturb her. Instead, he took a shower carefully, returned to bed, and began to practice the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not until night fell that Jane woke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus sitting next to her, Jane showed a happy expression. "Honey, are you watching me sleep?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Slut, you're overthinking it. I'm doing my own thing. It has nothing to do with you." Marcus cursed casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane curled her lips and said, "What a bummer! All men are the same. They forget what happens once they put on their pants!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Jane wrapped herself in a bath towel and walked out of Marcus' room, but she came face to face with Diana then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was just preparing dinner. Seeing Jane coming out of Marcus' room wrapped in a bath towel, she felt a little embarrassed. "I... I'm preparing dinner. Did I bump into you, Jane?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane also smiled awkwardly. After all, she had been Marcus' mother-in-law before. "No, Ms. Harrison, thanks for your hard work." Then, Jane returned to her room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While eating, Marcus received a WhatsApp message from Sweetheart: [I want to have dinner with you tonight. Are you free?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied: [Where?] With that, Yvonne's youthful and beautiful face appeared in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sweetheart: [Gourmet Restaurant. My dad often took me there when I was little. But now, I live abroad and </span><span>miss</span><span> it for a long time. Is it okay?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus: [When?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sweetheart: [Six-thirty in the evening!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus: [See you there!] Putting down his phone, Marcus stood up and then prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, are you done? You've barely eaten anything these past few days, and you've been working so hard every day. Can you handle it?" asked Diana, seeing that Marcus wanted to leave after taking a few bites.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her word "working" had a hidden meaning, and she deliberately glanced at Jane while she was speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was a little embarrassed and seemed to understand what Diana meant. But she didn't dare to say anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have something to do. Enjoy yourselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus </span><span>went out and </span><span>drove the Alphard commercial vehicle towards Gourmet Restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>H</span><span>e really liked Kingston's traditional cuisine</span><span> as well</span><span>, but he hardly had any chance because his family had been poor when he was young.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gourmet Restaurant was a time-honored restaurant in Solomia, which was already full when Marcus arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought he had to wait for a seat. But then, he saw Yvonne, who was wearing beige sportswear, waving at him not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry to have kept you waiting." Marcus sat down opposite Yvonne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne looked at the time. "Six twenty. Ten minutes early. You're not late."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus ordered some meat, seafood, and vegetables. Soon, the dishes were served, and they started eating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne ordered a bottle of Everclear. "To thank you, I will drink with you today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was stunned, thinking, "Does she actually want to drink Everclear?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two ate, drank, and chatted. After drinking a glass of Everclear, Yvonne was already a bit drunk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to refill the glass, but Marcus stopped her. "You can't drink anymore." Yvonne seemed well-behaved and started eating meat crazily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over dinner, their conversation flowed naturally, breaking down the walls between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What had started as awkward small talk transformed into a genuine connection, leaving them both feeling surprisingly comfortable with each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne looked bright and beautiful, but Marcus discovered that she had a lot of inner trauma after this conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her parents loved her very much. But they never knew what she really wanted and had always instilled their ideas into Yvonne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like the last blind date event, Yvonne hadn't liked Haley at all, but her parents had acted on their own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcus hadn't helped her, her marriage might have happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After </span><span>the dinner</span><span>, the two walked on the street, where the lights were dim. Marcus tentatively held Yvonne's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Yvonne glared at Marcus and asked, "Why do you hold my hand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled, "Do you remember that? Your mom approved of me. Let alone holding your hand, even if I do something more outrageous, your mom will not blame me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you dare!" Yvonne made a threatening gesture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she had no intention of breaking free from Marcus and just let Marcus hold her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, they arrived at the door of a popular nightclub. Yvonne insisted on going in to have some fun, and Marcus didn't refuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Heavy metal subwoofers boomed, and countless men and women danced to their heart's content on the dance floor, releasing the stress from work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the flashing, gorgeous neon lights, Yvonne took Marcus to sit down and ordered a few bottles of Champagne Armand de Brignac, fruits, and some snacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The consumption in this nightclub was not low, and the people who came here to play were all well-known figures in Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Marcus saw Haley, who was in a circular sofa seat.</span></p><div class="pagination">
