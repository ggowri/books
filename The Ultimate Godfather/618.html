        <h1>Chapter 617 Password</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't even glance at Natalie, his angular face revealing a confident demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elena opened the POS machine, swiped the card, and entered the simple password he had just mentioned. Soon, the screen displayed the words "Payment Succeeds".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Received 650 million dollars!" Then, there was an electronic notification sound for the received payment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it wasn't loud, everyone in the vicinity could hear it clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all stood frozen in their spots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The payment actually succeeded? Six hundred and fifty million dollars... Does this person really have so much money on their card?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could it be? He looks so ordinary... How could he have so much money?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A burst of chatter erupted among the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people's heartbeats accelerated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They might have just witnessed the most amazing moment in their lives&mdash;someone had spent 650 million dollars to buy all the jewelry in a jewelry store just for his pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was simply unbelievable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Joan and Natalie were also stunned, staring at Marcus with disbelief in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie rushed to the cashier counter, grabbed the POS machine, and examined it carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she saw the successful transaction record for the payment, she was completely devastated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus really had 650 million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reality shocked Natalie's mind like a thunderbolt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Natalie's memory, Marcus' parents were poor farmers, making his family a terribly poor one. In high school, everyone in the class looked down on him, and Natalie never gave him a glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus confessed his feelings to her, she not only rejected him directly but also insulted him with mean words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For her, Marcus and she belonged to different worlds, and he would never be able to catch up with her pace in life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, just two years after graduating from university, she had come to Solomia to make a living and, with her excellent professional qualities, successfully became the store manager of this luxury jewelry store, earning a monthly salary of over 30 thousand dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Natalie believe that she should be among the better ones among all her classmates. After all, graduates just two years out of university usually wouldn't have good careers and incomes unless they had a strong family background.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything Natalie had achieved was through her own efforts. This made Natalie very satisfied with herself, so when Marcus came to their store to buy jewelry, Natalie still felt superior to him, just like in school. She even thought that Marcus couldn't afford the Tears of the Angel, but little did she know that her biased thoughts were so ridiculous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Marcus was no longer the same as before. He was no longer the insecure, fragile, poor country bumpkin in Natalie's memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Marcus had grown into a giant who could casually squander 650 million dollars on jewelry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The laughable one was Natalie, who had always ridiculed Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't care about the various expressions on everyone's faces. At this very moment, he walked over to the Tears of the Angel, picked it up, and immediately felt the cool touch of the gemstone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the light, the Tears of the Angel emitted a sapphire-blue glow, dazzling and luxurious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't hold the Tears of the Angel like that! Put it down now!" Natalie instinctively spoke to Marcus in a reproachful tone, seemingly still unable to recognize her current position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, everything in this jewelry store belongs to me. I can hold it anyway I like, and even if I smash this jewelry store now, it has nothing to do with you," Marcus smiled coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie's face turned pale with anger, never expecting to find herself in such an awkward situation. She wanted to retort him but eventually could say nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Marcus had said, including the Tears of the Angel, everything in the jewelry store had been bought by Marcus. Now, Marcus was the owner here, and she had no right to ask Marcus to do anything in this store.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please help me pack all the jewelry," Marcus said to Elena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elena finally came out of her shock, nodded hastily to Marcus, and began packing the jewelry for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before she could take any action, Joan shouted, "Wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elena asked Joan, "Mrs. Jenkins, how can I help you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joan glanced at Marcus and said coldly, "He can have all the jewelry except Tears of the Angel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's expressions changed after hearing that because they never expected Joan to intervene in this matter at this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elena hesitated and said to Joan, "Mrs. Jenkins, he has already paid for the Tears of the Angel, so it belongs to him now. I'm so sorry, but I can't do as you say!"</span></p></div>
