        <h1>Chapter 453 Treating Breast Nodules</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Treating gynecological conditions may involve some actions that cross personal boundaries," Marcus said calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you're uncomfortable with that, I won't insist."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera's cheeks flushed deeply. "Mr. Fitzgerald, can I understand more about the treatment process before deciding?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus nodded. "The treatment isn't as complicated as you might think. As long as you cooperate, I'll handle everything. You won't need to do anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He paused briefly before adding, "However, I noticed earlier that you have nodules in your breasts. I can treat those as well, but it will require you to remove your top for the procedure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera's face turned an even deeper shade of red at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Removing her top?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That would leave her completely exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The thought made her uncomfortable, but she reasoned with herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she went to a hospital, she would likely have to remove her top for an examination anyway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And most gynecologists these days were men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Which was to say, she had to expose her parts sooner or later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At least Marcus was someone she knew and trusted, and she had a good impression of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Women often admire strength, and Marcus, with his wealth, capabilities, and sense of justice, was someone any woman would look up to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Still, Kiera was realistic. She knew the gap between their statuses was too great for her to entertain any romantic notions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she had to choose, however, she would rather expose herself to Marcus than to a stranger in a hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Taking a deep breath, she nodded. "I'm willing to cooperate, Mr. Fitzgerald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When would you like to start the treatment?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now," Marcus replied without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His intention wasn't to take advantage of Kiera.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had seen how serious her condition was and didn't want her to suffer through the invasive and irreversible damage of surgery. And after the surgery, she would be hospitalized for over a month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't want her to face such torment, so he offered to help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it had been anyone else, he wouldn't have bothered to intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his response, Kiera hesitated for a moment, her cheeks burning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Still, she slowly raised her hands and removed her white T-shirt, revealing a modest beige bra beneath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though conservative, her bra couldn't fully conceal her shapely figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The soft curves and fair skin caught Marcus' eye for a brief moment before he quickly redirected his focus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't intend to look at them, but they were too captivating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, he had just reached Ancient Martial Stage Six a few days ago, and his desire was hard to tame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera's breasts were stunning, and the scent she carried was sweet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was truly alluring, and Marcus was turned on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Does this work, Mr. Fitzgerald?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera asked shyly, clearly uncomfortable with her level of exposure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus met her gaze and replied evenly, "You'll need to remove the bra as well. I need unobstructed access to treat the nodules effectively."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a moment's hesitation, Kiera bit her lip and unhooked her bra, her movements slow and uncertain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When she finally removed it, Marcus caught a glimpse of her bare chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera's breasts were neither small nor prone to sagging. Perfectly pert and round, they seemed to defy gravity with their supple firmness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her areolas were tiny, no bigger than a thumbprint, delicately shaped and blushingly pink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Paired with her luminous skin, they were a startling contrast to any others Marcus had ever seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Embarrassment nearly drove Kiera to wish she could disappear into the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She glanced up at Marcus and asked hesitantly, "Mr. Fitzgerald, shall we begin?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus nodded solemnly, reigning in his wandering thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He summoned the Timeless Numinous Energy within him, focusing it into the palms of his hands, and gently placed them over the peaks of Kiera's breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instantly, a warm current flowed from his palms into her, traveling through the skin of her peaks and deeper inward, sparking an inexplicable tingling sensation throughout her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She shuddered slightly, and a deep, involuntary moan escaped her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mmm..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sensation was profoundly unique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera faintly recalled a night during her school days when the girls in her dorm watched porn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Curious, she had watched an episode with them. The embarrassment she felt then mirrored the physical sensations Marcus' touch evoked now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A string deep within her soul seemed to vibrate, stirring her entire being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You have nodules in both breasts," Marcus informed her softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Each will take about ten minutes. Try to hold on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He then increased the flow of the Timeless Numinous Energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Streams of warmth swiftly penetrated deeper into Kiera's body, coursing through her veins in a great celestial circuit, eventually returning to the peaks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bit by bit, it targeted the congested nodules within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera suddenly felt an unprecedented sense of relief wash over her, as if a cascade of freshness had descended upon her.</span></p></div>
