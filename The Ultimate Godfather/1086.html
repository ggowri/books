  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the policemen sprang into action, aiming to fully subdue Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, visibly displeased, demanded, "I'd like to know, on what basis are you arresting me? As a law enforcement officer, shouldn't you look into the full story before attempting an arrest? Is it simply because the father and son are your family that you're blatantly taking their side? This is a blatant abuse of power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regis' eyes chilled. He'd never anticipated that Marcus, seemingly in his early twenties, could be so sharp-tongued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' statement struck right at Regis' sore spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though eager to help Garrick and Sebastien seek retribution, Regis was, after all, a cop, not part of the underworld.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Were he to arrest Marcus without investigation and evidence, it would undeniably be an abuse of his authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Regis, don't pay any heed to his drivel. He's beaten Sebastien to a pulp, and all these people </span><span>lying on the ground can prove</span><span> that he attacked unprovoked. Isn't that sufficient grounds for arrest?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Regis could hesitate, Garrick interjected, "Exactly! Regis. This guy was really aggressive, constantly stating that even if the police came, they couldn't do anything to him and that he could still kill at will. He's </span><span>likely </span><span>a thug with an abusive streak, likely a psychopathic murderer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>S</span><span>uch a person is nothing but a menace</span><span> </span><span>in society. Regis, don't be fooled by his words. You must lock him up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastien, lying on the ground, was blatantly distorting the facts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, it was he who had been bragging that his uncle was the police chief and that even if he committed a crime in the girls' dormitory, the police wouldn't dare arrest him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he was pinning the blame on Marcus. He was truly shameless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regis sneered, "Did you hear that? You've assaulted so many people, and each one of them is at least seriously injured. No more evidence is needed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, undaunted, retorted, "I only intervened for a just cause. I struck Sebastien because he had malicious intentions towards my sister, attempting to drag her into a car and rape her. As for these guys on the ground, they all came with Garrick to attack me. I was merely acting in self-defense!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, what's the reason for arresting me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus present his case so rationally, Morgana stepped forward, stating, "I can vouch for this. I'm a teacher at this school. I assure you I </span><span>am not</span><span> acquaint</span><span>ed</span><span> with Marcus and have been an impartial observer throughout."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words made Regis' complexion sour, and once again, he found himself lacking a legitimate reason for the arrest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Regis, this guy is just spouting excuses. Your nephew was severely beaten. Are you not going to avenge him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if this fellow has a reason for self-defense, given the gravity of this incident, you should still take him to the station for further interrogation," Garrick advised Regis, simultaneously shooting him a meaningful glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Marcus could claim self-defense, given the severity of the case, Regis had every reason to take Marcus to the police station for investigation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was common knowledge that once someone was in police custody, the police held all the cards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite engaging in improper conduct, they could always conjure up various excuses to avoid accountability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't just an issue in Uswad. In fact, it was a phenomenon seen in countries worldwide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There had been numerous cases of individuals dying or being maimed under mysterious circumstances while in police custody.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was precisely why Garrick was so eager to get Marcus to the police station.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regis immediately grasped Garrick's implication and then said to Marcus again, "Then you'll have to come with me to the station for an investigation!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
