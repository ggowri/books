  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine shook her head and explained, "His name is Marcus. He's a friend of mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gloria responded with a soft "Oh," then added, "By the way, I don't think I ever knew which university you got into after high school. It's been so many years since we last saw each other; I'm really glad we could reconnect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine casually replied, "Solomia Information University."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gloria raised an eyebrow, a fleeting look of envy crossing her face. "I never would've guessed. You really surprised me&mdash;getting into such a prestigious university. I remember back in school, your grades weren't as good as mine. Maybe it was because my family could afford to send me to extra tutoring, unlike yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in high school, that was when Catherine's family was at its lowest point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mother was seriously ill, and her father was a heavy drinker and gambler, leaving the family with no income at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine had to work odd jobs during the summer to make ends meet, relying on the occasional help from relatives and friends just to scrape by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were many times when she considered dropping out of school&mdash;it was too much to handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With life already so difficult, how could she afford tutoring?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Gloria had pointed out, her academic performance back then had indeed been better than Catherine's, otherwise, she wouldn't have been able to become the president of the student council.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing Gloria's discomfort, Catherine hurried to downplay her success. "What's the use of attending a prestigious school? I'm just here now, looking for a job after being laid off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gloria felt a little better after hearing that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but think that if she hadn't been distracted by her high school romance, she could've easily gotten into a much better school than Catherine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her grades had plummeted after she started dating, and in the end, she barely made it into an average university in a neighboring city, finishing with just a bachelor's degree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, I remember you didn't have it easy growing up," Gloria continued, raising her voice just a little. "Is everything better now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The way she said it almost seemed deliberate, as though she wanted others to overhear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine felt a pang of discomfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't the mention of her difficult family situation that bothered her; it was the fact that it had left deep emotional scars. Her childhood had been filled with shame and insecurity, and hearing it spoken aloud by Gloria only made her feel worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face tightened as she forced a smile and replied, "Things got better once I started working."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh," Gloria said, her tone skeptical. "But even though you graduated from a top school, you must have just finished last year, right? How much could you possibly be earning in a good job? I heard your dad gambled away the family's money, and your mom's health isn't great... with a salary like yours, how could you help them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gloria's words grew sharper, almost as though she was trying to tear down Catherine's dignity to lift her own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, the people in the line were watching them, their glances tinged with judgment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine's cheeks flushed, and she answered quickly, trying to regain control of the conversation. "Well, I actually became a sales manager at a real estate office. My income is pretty decent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gloria's expression turned mocking. "Oh really? If you're making good money, why are you here looking for another job?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tone was dripping with sarcasm, and the others in line nodded along, casting doubtful glances at Catherine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't make sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sales manager in real estate typically earned high commissions, and some top-tier managers in prime locations could even make millions a year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the most skilled people got those positions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And I'm curious," Gloria continued, her voice dripping with disbelief, "which real estate office did you work at? If you've got such a great job, will I get a discount when I buy property from you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cedars Villas," Catherine answered flatly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cedars Villas?" Gloria's eyes widened. "That's a famous luxury development in Solomia, right? Developed by the Golden Group, if I'm not mistaken. You worked there? Is that true? Anyone know if what she's saying is real?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few people nearby immediately began to question her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, she's only in her early twenties, and she said she just graduated. How could she possibly have been a manager? Maybe she was a regular sales agent, but that's a huge stretch to claim she was a manager."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I've never heard of anyone that young being promoted to manager in such a high-end place. She's probably just lying to impress us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whispers grew louder, and more people cast skeptical glances at Catherine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gloria, sensing her victory, leaned in closer, a smug smile on her face. "Catherine, I know you've always struggled because of your family's situation. But there's no need to lie to make yourself feel superior. Do you think we're all idiots?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just because you graduated from a top university doesn't mean you can get a job as a sales manager straight away. If you did, then maybe you got there through... other means. If that's the case, then forget I said anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Gloria first heard that Catherine had gotten into a prestigious university, she had been filled with jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, seeing Catherine in a vulnerable position, it was like a weight had lifted off her own shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine's face flushed with frustration, but she kept her composure. She'd been bullied by Gloria enough in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, they were just kids who didn't know any better. But now, years later, she had hoped things might have changed. It seemed that Gloria still had a lot to learn.</span></p><div class="pagination">
