  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've heard about a hidden port of smuggling in Solariae. Not only do they smuggle guns there, but they even sell heavy weapons like grenades and mortars," Maxine said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright. Sure enough, the police know more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus nodded with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What he said sounded like a mockery anyway, and Maxine immediately rolled her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus hung up the phone and was going to go buy some guns at the so-called port in Solariae in the next few days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had just hung up his phone when it rang again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was Richard calling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus, your uncle came to Solomia to see a doctor. Can you come over and help him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Upon hearing this, a bearded and sloppy middle-aged man came to Marcus' mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This man was his uncle, Nick Fitzgerald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick was also Richard's biological younger brother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since Nick was living in a different state, Marcus had only met him a few times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus hadn't seen Nick since he grew up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't know why Nick suddenly came to Solomia to see a doctor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet Richard had already told Marcus so, and he had no reason to refuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus drove straight to the Cedars Villas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Marcus walked into the villa, there was another middle-aged couple and a girl in her twenties in the house, in addition to Richard and Melinda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The middle-aged couple was none other than Nick and his wife, Aria Fitzgerald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The young woman was Marcus' cousin, Lisa Fitzgerald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus and Lisa only met twice when they were young, and now they hadn't seen each other for almost ten years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though Lisa looked the same as before, she was dressed more fashionably. With her delicate and heavy makeup, she looked like a fashion model.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Based on Lisa's outfit, she was probably in the middle class as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick, on the other hand, got even older, his hair turned gray, and there were more wrinkles on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aria still looked simple, as all honest people in the rural areas did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus, come and greet Nick, Aria and Lisa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Marcus come in, Nick immediately stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus greeted Nick, Aria, and Lisa respectively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick stood up and held Marcus' hand. "Marcus and I haven't seen each other for over ten years, and he's grown up. Even though he's not a descendant of the Fitzgerald family, he was so nice to both of you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Look at the grand villa Marcus gave you. It's so luxurious!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aria had checked every room in the house since she entered, and she couldn't stop praising it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was much more luxurious than the two-story house they had in their hometown. When Lisa and her boyfriend got married, they would move to Solomia as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maybe they'd live in a better place than Richard's house by then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dad, don't you know Marcus lives at his wife's house? He married into a rich and powerful family in Solomia, so this villa was definitely bought by his wife," Lisa reminded in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While they had been living in another state, the economy there was not as strong as in Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Besides, Lisa had studied in a secondary technical school in Solomia, so she worked in Solomia all along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lisa had rented a stall in a clothing wholesale market in Solomia and started a business, and she could earn two to three hundred thousand dollars a year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lisa's boyfriend was the deputy manager of the clothing wholesale market, and he came from a middle-class family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, Lisa was considered pretty successful in the eyes of the ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had got engaged to her boyfriend, and they had bought an apartment of about two thousand square feet as a matrimonial home in one of the luxury communities in Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The apartment was paid off by both of them together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made Lisa feel quite proud of herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, seeing Richard and his family living in a well-known villa in Solomia, Lisa was a bit jealous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Later, Lisa heard that Marcus had married into one of Solomia's rich and powerful families, which was why she realized who had bought the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh, I have forgot that Marcus lives at his wife's house, but anyway, Marcus is quite capable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick nodded. Regarding the matter of Marcus getting married, Nick despised Richard in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He called Richard several times to stop him, but Richard kept refusing him by respecting Marcus' choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made Nick have a problem with Richard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Nick's opinion, even if the Fitzgerald family were poor, they wouldn't live in their wives' houses, and it would be a disgrace for their family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Nick, Lisa, Marcus got divorced a long time ago, and he bought this villa with his own money," Melinda reminded in a hurry.</span></p><div class="pagination">
