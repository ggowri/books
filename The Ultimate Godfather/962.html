  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus knew that Kiera was simply too exhausted from the intense pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her lower body was spasming, with a milky fluid seeping out continuously. She lay on the bed, gasping for breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was intensely captivated by the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Driven by an uncontrollable urge, he spread Kiera's long, slender legs, positioned his member at the entrance of her intimate space, and thrust in again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, Kiera, who had been on the verge of fainting, immediately snapped back to consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her most intimate part was filled to the brim, and she couldn't help but surrender to the intense feeling of fullness, letting out another high-pitched cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus grasped Kiera's sensual and alluring waist with both hands and began another round of fierce lovemaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His member moved in and out of her intimate space continuously, creating a rhythmic sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiera was immersed in waves of pleasure. Her moans echoed throughout the room, and the air was thick with the scent of passion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, too, could no longer withstand the intense stimulation. After one particularly wild thrust, he released his seeds into Kiera's intimate space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiera reached her sixth climax in this thrust and collapsed onto the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once clean and tidy bed sheet was now wrinkled and soaked in a large area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the dim light, it was clear that the originally white bed sheet was now stained red, a sign that Kiera had lost her virginity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't help but take a deep breath. After his release, he felt an immense sense of pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And through this Dual Cultivation with Kiera, he reached the minor completion stage of Stage Four of the Acquired Return Essence Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was now only one step away from the peak of Stage Four of the Acquired Return Essence Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though it was merely a minor breakthrough within a realm, Marcus's strength saw a significant improvement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he were to fight Alison now, he would be able to crush her even more easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moment later, Kiera snapped out of her dazed state. Her normally gentle face was now flushed red, making her look even more striking and lovable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, I am yours now..." she said shyly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing that she was naked, she was somewhat embarrassed and quickly covered herself with a blanket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus laughed and said, "You're already my woman. Why be so shy?" As he spoke, he pulled the blanket off Kiera.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiera let out a cry of surprise, her large breasts jiggling with Marcus's movement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus laughed heartily, pulled her into his arms, kissed her lips, and then fondled her round and firm breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well... Marcus, please stop teasing me. I can't take it anymore. My lower body hurts a bit now..." Kiera said softly, her face still flushed with shyness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps due to the earlier frenzy, she felt a burning pain in her lower body, but the pleasure still lingered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't sure if it was a hallucination or something else, but at that moment, she felt a surge of strength and more energetic than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't know that this was directly related to the Dual Cultivation with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, through the Dual Cultivation, her body had been transformed, and she had crossed the threshold to become a novice warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were doing so well earlier. Why are you getting shy now that it's over?" Marcus asked with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, please don't say that. It's so embarrassing&hellip; This was my first time acting like that in front of someone else. I don't think I ever want to do it again&hellip;" Kiera bit her lip, her pretty face flushing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Never again? Then I guess I'll have to find someone else," Marcus said, half-joking.</span></p><div class="pagination">
