  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And more importantly, Royal Entertainment was no longer owned by the Walsh family. It now belonged to one man&mdash;a mysterious figure known only as "Death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That meant Miles wasn't just acting on his own. His corruption, his power plays&mdash;all of it had likely been sanctioned by Death himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This Death had been making waves in Uswad's business world, snatching up top corporations with seemingly endless resources.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the past six months alone, he had spent trillions, acquiring Sync Group from Kingston, Eastcomm Group, SiliconWave Technologies, MedicaGenix, Bayside Petroleum Company from Solomia, and most recently, Royal Entertainment itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any one of these corporations was enough to shake the entire industry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, they all belonged to Death now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer power and wealth he commanded were unimaginable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Miles was operating under Death's protection, then what Marcus had just done was tantamount to declaring war on the most powerful entity in Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe's pulse quickened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then she remembered something&mdash;something from the first time she had met Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been at an industry party, where he had shown up as Lila's boyfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, he had gotten into a heated altercation with Ross, the so-called prince of Royal Entertainment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the time, everyone had assumed Marcus was doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, something unbelievable had happened. Ross' own mentor, a high-ranking member of Southvaia's dark sorcery cult, had suddenly bowed to Marcus&mdash;out of pure fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had called Marcus the bearer of the Supreme Token.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then, in front of everyone, he had forced Ross to kneel, apologize, and slap himself in the face repeatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ross had beaten himself so badly, he had ended up hospitalized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night had been seared into Chloe's memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never fully understood what had happened, but it was clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if Marcus could humiliate Ross in front of everyone and walk away untouched, then he was far more than just the owner of Stellar Entertainment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, her anxiety eased a little. She stayed close behind Marcus as they entered the Golden Hotel's grand ballroom, where the Luminara Awards were set to take place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The venue was breathtaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gilded chandeliers hung from the ceiling, casting a warm golden glow. The air buzzed with chatter and the clinking of champagne glasses. It was a gathering of the most elite figures in the entertainment industry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus immediately noticed something strange. Not one of the people from the last event he attended was here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last time he was in this exact ballroom, he had humiliated Ross in front of the entire industry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now? Not a single familiar face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't know this, but after Ross' public humiliation, his grandfather Zachary had gone to extreme lengths to erase the incident from existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had sealed off the information and used Royal Entertainment's influence to systematically blacklist every single person who had attended the party.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, they had been silenced, pushed out of the industry, stripped of opportunities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Careers ended quietly, reputations faded, and over time, their names disappeared from Uswad's entertainment scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was why no one here recognized Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before arriving, Marcus had actually called Lila, asking if she would be attending the Luminara Awards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her response had been clear&mdash;she was out of the country, busy filming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, this year's Luminara Awards didn't have any major nominations for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she had politely declined the invitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that meant&mdash;aside from Chloe&mdash;there was no one at the event who had even heard of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Chloe? The moment she walked in, she was the center of attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cameras flashed instantly. Journalists rushed to capture her arrival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Chloe Sinclair, one of the Twelve Rising Stars! Damn, it's been half a year, and she's still breathtaking."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"More than that&mdash;she's not just a pretty face. She can act and sing. 'Midnight Serenade' was a smash hit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With that song alone, she's practically cemented her status as a top-tier artist."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's the clear frontrunner for Best Female Singer tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then someone scoffed, "You guys don't get it, do you? Chloe might be the most talented nominee, but she's never played by the rules. No way they let her win."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah," another chimed in. "I'd bet money the award is already locked in for Selena Marlowe."</span></p><div class="pagination">
