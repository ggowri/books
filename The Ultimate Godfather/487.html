  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grinding his teeth, one of the level-five metahumans spat, "I didn't expect you to remain so arrogant in front of the two of us. Today, I'll show you the true power of a level-five metahuman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, both metahumans unleashed their abilities in unison. One wielded ice, the other fire. Two forces that complemented each other perfectly converged from opposite sides to obliterate Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Against such an assault, the Marcus of the past might have struggled to defend himself. But now, his cultivation had reached the Minor Mastery of Ancient Martial Stage Six, and his Timeless Warrior's Grimoire had advanced to its fifth tier. His strength had soared to an entirely new level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rather than dodging, Marcus casually countered their combined attack with a single punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deafening explosion reverberated through the hall as his fist shattered the ice and fire powers into nothingness. The destructive shockwave swept the hall, sending weaker individuals flying like ragdolls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two level-five metahumans exchanged uneasy glances, their expressions slightly grave. They hadn't expected Marcus to be this powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus stepped forward again, using Shadow Step to amplify his speed several times. In an instant, he was in front of the fire-wielding metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The metahuman, controlling the Fire Attribute Power, quickly summoned a massive flaming beast, a towering entity that lunged toward Marcus with ferocious intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus didn't waste time with elaborate moves. He struck with a single, unrelenting punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fire beast exploded into fragments on impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus delivered another devastating punch aimed directly at the metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The level-five metahuman's face twisted in terror. He tried to retreat, his body jerking back to evade Marcus' attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus' fist wasn't just fast. It was vast, its reach spanning an area too wide to escape. Worse still, it carried an oppressive binding force, freezing the metahuman in place like an insect caught in a web.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Left with no choice, the metahuman unleashed a counterattack in a frantic bid to defend himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thunderous crash reverberated through the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' punch tore through the resistance, sending the metahuman hurtling backward. His body smashed into one of the stone pillars with such force that the pillar crumbled into rubble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The metahuman lay crumpled amidst the ruins, blood gushing from his mouth. A gaping, basketball-sized hole tore through his chest. He was lifeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A level-five metahuman was killed instantly with one strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer display of strength stunned everyone in the hall, their faces pale with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other level-five metahuman stared, his expression frozen in horror. His hands trembled as Marcus turned his piercing gaze toward him. The metahuman began to backpedal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus advanced, his Timeless Warrior's Grimoire roaring to life. In his palm, the Numinous Energy merged with Thunderfire Power, creating a devastating force. At the same time, his power of Minor Mastery of Ancient Martial Stage Six surged to its peak. Marcus struck out, sending a palm-shaped imprint of pure destruction hurtling through space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The imprint ripped through the air, shattering the void as it bore down on the metahuman, enveloping the area around him in an inescapable force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The level-five metahuman's face froze in utter horror. Witnessing his comrade obliterated in a single strike had already sapped his fighting spirit. Now, as Marcus unleashed an even more terrifying attack, his will to resist crumbled entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! Stop!" His desperate cry rang out. But it was far too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' palm imprint descended, striking with unrelenting force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The metahuman's body disintegrated into nothingness. It was as if he had never existed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd shuddered violently, their hearts pounding in fear. Just two attacks and the family's strongest defenders were utterly annihilated. Who was this Uswad youth?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' overwhelming power left the Cole family's high-ranking members pale and trembling. Desperation drove them to flee, hoping to escape their doom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus raised his hand, and an invisible wave of energy spread through the hall. The space around them locked tight, sealing off every possible exit. Escape was impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Marcus called upon his Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, pushing its power to its peak. Waves of destruction rippled out, each infused with the devastating force of Thunderfire Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The assaults were relentless and merciless. Even the highly advanced fourth-generation cyborgs couldn't withstand the ferocity of Marcus' attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Screams and cries filled the air, echoing in the grand hall as it transformed into a hellish battleground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, have mercy! We've made a mistake!" One of the Cole family's senior members begged Marcus for leniency, his face pale with terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, Marcus no longer seemed human. He was a reaper incarnate, and they were no more than lambs awaiting slaughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' casual strikes left them defenseless, with no chance to evade. Death was inevitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regret filled the man's heart, choking him. If they had known Marcus' strength was this overwhelming, the Cole family would never have dared provoke him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before his plea could linger, a streak of annihilating energy flashed across the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The light pierced the man's throat, cutting his life short.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes widened in shock as he crumpled to the ground, lifeless, yet another victim in Marcus' unyielding onslaught.</span></p><div class="pagination">
