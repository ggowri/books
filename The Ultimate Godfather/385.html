        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver immediately nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Randy's furrowed brows, he walked over and pulled him to Marcus' side. "Apologize to Mr. Death right away, or no one will save you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Randy looked completely defeated. He never imagined that there was someone his cousin feared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although he was still unwilling, under Oliver's pressure, he had no choice but to apologize to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't even glance at Randy and stood up to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He walked over to his Aston Martin and saw that the car had been badly damaged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver quickly ran up. "Mr. Death, where are you going? Let me take you back. I'll replace your car with a new one within an hour!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bayside Villa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon after, Marcus got into Oliver's police car and drove back to Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Within an hour, a brand-new Aston Martin DB12 arrived at Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't refuse it. He still liked this model very much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The previous car was too damaged and inconvenient for traveling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying goodbye to the warrior Oliver, Marcus received a call from Josie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The medical production line had been transported to Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To ensure the safety of the transport, Josie personally accompanied the convoy to Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, they were at the Solomia highway entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus drove the brand-new Aston Martin to the highway entrance and saw over a dozen heavy trucks carrying medical equipment passing through the toll booth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Josie appeared in his view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She seemed exhausted from traveling with the convoy overnight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she still looked elegant in her beige coat, directing the vehicles through the toll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus gently walked over and patted her on the shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Josie instinctively turned around and saw the one that always captivated her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Honey... you came so soon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Josie was instantly delighted, her longing unable to be contained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She threw herself into Marcus' arms!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling the faint fragrance from her, Marcus couldn't hold back his emotions and gently stroked Josie's hair. "Ms. Shelman, you've worked hard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Josie's beautiful eyes sparkled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After seeing Marcus, all her fatigue seemed to disappear. "It's no trouble at all to help you, my love!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, the two of them led the medical equipment convoy to the Pharmaceutical Industrial Park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thanks to Michelle having arranged the installation team in advance and the BioFusion Pharmaceuticals technicians that Josie brought along, the medical equipment was quickly and safely set up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The installation was expected to take about three days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Michelle was busy with work and wasn't present in the pharmaceutical park at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Josie got into Marcus' Aston Martin. "Did you miss me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus looked at Josie and asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, of course I did. You've been away from Kingston for so many days, and I've been restless every day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Josie said, blushing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You must be hungry. I'll take you to eat Solomia's cuisine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No, I don't want to eat Solomia's food."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Josie shook her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus was taken aback and asked, "Then what do you want to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go to the hotel first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Josie answered firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Uh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A few beads of sweat appeared on Marcus' forehead. He didn't expect her to be so bold now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She could directly say such bold words to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What? Don't you miss me, honey?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Marcus standing there stunned, Josie hurriedly asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then let's go to the hotel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus turned the car around and soon arrived at the Hilton Hotel, booking a presidential suite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as they closed the door, Josie kissed Marcus on the lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Honey, I missed you so much... I want you to bang me... I feel so empty..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Josie kissed and undressed at the same time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seemed they hadn't seen each other for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus missed her a lot and quickly got into the mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The electric feeling between their lips made Marcus' lower abdomen heat up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His manhood quickly became erect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He pulled Josie into his arms and roughly threw her onto the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Josie let out a scream, seeming to really like Marcus' rough behavior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her face turned bright red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, she had completely taken off her coat and shirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She revealed her white bra and her cleavage was clearly visible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus pounced on her, ripping off Josie's bra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two large breasts trembled and popped out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Marcus had been taking care of her for some time, Josie's breasts became even rosier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were rosy, and the two nipples were already erect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Honey, take it in. I want you to kiss me there..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Josie panted and made enticing sounds.</span></p></div>
