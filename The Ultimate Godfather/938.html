  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At Stage Four of the Acquired Return Essence Realm, Marcus could easily crush Alison, an expert at the eighth level of Demon Fighter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alison had no chance of fighting back in his presence. She was like a fly caught in a spider's web.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus could easily surpass the limits of four different States in combat, effortlessly overwhelming his opponents. Such remarkable strength in challenges beyond his level was something even Roger could never hope to achieve.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alison could hardly wrap her mind around who Marcus had become.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What stunned her even more was that just a few months ago, Marcus had been an ordinary man.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In mere months, Marcus had transformed from an everyday person into an expert at the Return Essence stage. And now, he could easily defeat her, leaping across multiple States with ease!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not only did Marcus have an exceptionally rapid cultivation speed and an astounding ability to surpass opponents' levels, but his fighting techniques were completely unfamiliar to Alison.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most surprising of all was his awe-inspiring Dual Cultivation method.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After just one session of Dual Cultivation, both of their cultivation levels skyrocketed. The entire process was not only painless but also brought an indescribable sense of pleasure, unlike anything Alison had ever experienced.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everything sounded so unbelievable that had she not seen it with her own eyes, Alison would never have believed any of it to be true.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Marcus left, Alison stood frozen for a moment before turning to leave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But as soon as she took a step, she felt a sharp, tearing sensation from a mysterious part of her body&mdash;an unmistakable sign of the intensity of what had just occurred between them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though the sensation was incredibly intense, it didn't stop Alison from walking. It just made her movements seem a bit odd as if something was out of place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two hours later, Alison appeared in a desolate, snow-covered expanse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Beneath the icy landscape, over 3,000 feet underground, was a vast, hidden command center.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alison's figure emerged inside the center, and at that moment, she had fully returned to her original form.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her flawless, smooth skin, seductive attire, tall and alluring figure, and angelic features&mdash;every step she took through the underground command center drew the attention of countless eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clearly, with Alison's stunning beauty, any man would be captivated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Alison remained distant, her demeanor high and untouchable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She never interacted with any man, except for Roger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she moved through the bustling hallways of the command center, Alison's presence was regal, as cold and majestic as a queen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, she arrived at a spacious command center.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A tall man dressed in military green, with striking blonde hair, piercing blue eyes, and a handsome face, stood in front of a sand table, seemingly deep in thought.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This man was none other than Roger, the unquestioned ruler of the ice-covered command center.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alison, where did you go earlier?" Roger asked, his voice steady.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had noticed her absence since the morning and initially thought she was in seclusion, focused on her cultivation. But seeing her now, worn and travel-stained, he knew she had been out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I... I went to </span><span>Acoton</span><span>," Alison replied, her voice faltering.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was a noticeable hesitation in her response, and she seemed unusually nervous. Roger picked up on the subtle change but, trusting her completely, didn't press further. He merely raised an eyebrow in surprise. "Alison, did your cultivation break through?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alison nodded forcefully, her mind involuntarily drifting back to the intimate moments she'd shared with Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But fearing Roger might detect something amiss, she quickly shoved the thought aside.</span></p><div class="pagination">
