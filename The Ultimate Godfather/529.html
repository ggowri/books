  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like Landon hadn't moved for a while, so Patrick couldn't help but remind him. Before Patrick could even finish his sentence, Landon slapped him across the face. The force of the strike left Patrick dazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you hitting me all of a sudden? The person you should be slapping is that guy over there. You've got the wrong person!" Patrick groaned, covering the side of his face, and his teeth still ached from the slap Marcus had given him earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain from Marcus' slap hadn't even faded, and now Landon had delivered another blow, amplifying the discomfort tenfold. If he weren't gritting his teeth, he'd probably be screaming by now. The people around were equally confused by Landon's sudden attack on Patrick. No one knew why Landon would strike his own man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm slapping you, you idiot!" Landon's furious voice cut through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick froze for a second, then tried to explain, "What did I do wrong? Please tell me, I'll fix it. Just let me know." Before Patrick could finish his words, Landon slapped him again&mdash;harder this time. Patrick was knocked to the ground, crying out in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You had to mess with the wrong guy, didn't you? You chose to cross Mr. Fitzgerald, and now you're as good as dead." Landon hissed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just the day before, Landon had been caught in a clash with Marcus. If it weren't for his father, Valentin, chopping off his finger in desperation and apologizing to Marcus, Landon would already be a goner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, Landon didn't understand Valentin's actions. But after hearing Valentin's explanation, he finally realized the extent of his mistake. He had crossed a man who was not to be messed with&mdash;Marcus, someone even the mighty </span><span>Battle God</span><span> Oliver respected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Patrick had gone and called him to the scene. Landon's anger only grew as he thought about it. He could've killed Patrick right there and then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick, still dazed, blinked in confusion and asked, "What do you mean? I don't quite understand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Landon kicked Patrick harshly, his voice cold with fury. "You really are a fool, aren't you? I mean, you messed with Mr. Fitzgerald. Why the hell would you do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaned in closer, and his voice was low and threatening. "Let me tell you something. Mr. Fitzgerald is someone even my father wouldn't dare cross. If we anger him, the entire Whitman family could be wiped out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When those words were spoken, it wasn't just Patrick who froze. Luke, Natalia, and everyone else present stood there. Their faces were a mixture of shock and disbelief. None of them could have imagined that the young man in front of them held such a distinguished status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "Even Landon, heir to the Whitman family, is so afraid of him. Who can this person possibly be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick stammered, and his face was drained of color, "Are you joking? Someone as important as that, and I've never even heard of him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Landon kicked Patrick again, and his voice was filled with disgust. "Joking? Do you think I'm joking with you? </span><span>Why</span><span> the Whitman family would have someone as dumb as you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Landon snapped his fingers, signaling his men to subdue Patrick and pin him to the ground. Patrick struggled, but he was no match for them. They held him down with ease, preventing any escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With everyone watching, Landon walked calmly up to Marcus and bowed low. "Mr. Fitzgerald, I had no idea it was you. If I had known, I never would have dared to approach you. Please, in light of my ignorance, spare me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was stunned. Landon, heir to the Whitman family, was bowing before Marcus, practically begging for mercy. This was a man who commanded respect from even the highest powers in Kingston, yet here he was, acting so submissive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shock was palpable, especially for Luke, the head of campus security. His body trembled as he realized who Marcus truly was. Luke had been part of the group that tried to confront Marcus earlier. With Marcus' connections, Luke now understood how foolish he had been to get involved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't even glance at Landon. His silence only made Landon more anxious, his forehead beading with sweat. "Mr. Fitzgerald, I understand now," Landon said, wiping his brow, "I know what I need to do." He turned to his men and barked, "Cut off his hands and make him apologize to Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd gasped. Patrick's face went pale, and he let out a desperate cry. "Please, let's talk about this. You can't do this to me! I'm part of the Whitman family. You can't treat me like this!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
