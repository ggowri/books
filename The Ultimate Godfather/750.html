Its massive body crashed to the ground, joining the others in death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And so, all five sea beasts fell by Marcus' hand alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whew..." Marcus exhaled heavily, wiping sweat from his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd killed five leviathans, yet he could still detect faint energy pulses emanating from their bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Intrigued, Marcus approached one of the massive corpses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He discovered a glowing orb inside the creature's body using his X-ray vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy waves were radiating from this mysterious orb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, this sphere was the beast's core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beast cores were the wellspring of power within magical creatures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The higher the creature's rank, the more energy its core contained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While these leviathans weren't particularly high-ranked, their sheer size made up for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moving such enormous bodies required tremendous energy reserves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, their cores held substantial power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Timeless Warrior's Grimoire listed numerous uses for beast cores.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It could be used for cultivation, Rune crafting, amulet making, and many other purposes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Marcus used his golden scimitar to slice open one leviathan's belly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He precisely located the core's position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Marcus held the core in his palm, he felt its immense power surging through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This core's quality far exceeds my expectations. Using it for cultivation will give my powers a massive boost!"</span></p></div>
