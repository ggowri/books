He grasped the gun body and jammed the pistol trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter how hard Mike pulled it, the pistol remained unresponsive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus grabbed Mike by the collar and turned him around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mike was terrified and struggled desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tell me, was it your idea to attack me?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From the first time he saw Mike, Marcus felt that he was definitely not good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unexpectedly, Marcus still underestimated Mike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mike is truly a wolf in sheep's clothing," Marcus thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's not me, not me. It's all my grandfather who wants to kill you, and it has nothing to do with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mike shook his head desperately. His cancer had just been cured, and he didn't want to be killed like this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Haha, your grandfather is dead, and you still want to frame him. Scum like you don't deserve to live in this world!" Marcus sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had suspected that the previous murder was led by Mike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet he didn't expect that Mike wouldn't dare to admit it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you dare to kill me, the Cole family will fight with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mike mentioned the Cole family again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus rolled his eyes, wondering what it meant that the two men always regarded the Cole family as their patron.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No more nonsense with Mike; Marcus directly broke his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mike looked desperate, instantly widened his eyes, and soon became a cold corpse!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After that, Marcus didn't stay and left the hotel directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hated people who bit the hand that fed them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jordon and Mike could have received his free treatment, and they could have lived well in Uswad or Acoton in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, they ruined a golden opportunity with their own hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, they both died in the hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next day, the news of the murder of Jordon and Mike immediately spread throughout Solariae.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It caused a huge stir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Jordon was a world-renowned figure in the medical field.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His visit to Uswad this time hadn't even started yet, but it had already attracted the attention of all parties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To everyone's shock, they were shot dead in the hotel that night!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Robert and his daughter, Jade, received the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were shocked and also speculated about the identity of the murderer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus ignored all kinds of rumors from outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, he came to a slum in the south of Solariae.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sitting in the outdoor noodle restaurant in the slum, he was eating pasta.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Through a series of previous understandings, he knew that in Solariae, the slum was the gathering place for people in the underground world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was quite chaotic here, and there were often fights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some stall owners were miserable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were all small traders but had to pay high protection fees to those in the underground world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The pasta restaurant where Marcus was eating was run by a couple in their thirties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their child was only three or four years old, but to make money, they took their child with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The child was dressed in rags and looked dirty, but he was very polite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as guests came, he would take the initiative to greet them and move chairs for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The people from Black Tiger Gang are coming. Pack up, or it will be too late!" A voice came from not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The young couple, Theo and Mary, immediately looked worried and hurriedly began packing up their things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They knew that if they didn't run, they would not only have to pay huge protection fees but also be beaten up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bro, we have to close the stall, and you should go quickly. You can't leave when Black Tiger Gang comes. This plate of pasta is on me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man, Theo, said to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' eyes flashed, and he asked, "Is Black Tiger Gang the biggest gang around here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While packing, Theo replied, "No, but Black Tiger Gang is a famous gang in the south."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why do you ask so many questions? These people in the underground world are ruthless. It's no use knowing so much. Hurry, or you will be beaten!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Theo reminded again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Theo could finish, the table not far away was kicked to the ground by a gangster with red hair!</span></p><div class="pagination">
