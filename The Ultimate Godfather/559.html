  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader of the Black Hawk Legion barked the command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, nine tanks rumbled in from all sides, closing in fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their massive barrels swung into position, locking onto Marcus. Then, in unison, they fired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom! Boom! Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deafening roar of explosions rocked the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tanks' shells tore through the air, barreling toward Marcus at breakneck speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus stood his ground, his eyes burning with determination. It was clear the Black Hawk Legion wasn't holding back&mdash;they'd brought out the big guns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanks, of all things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, he wasn't fazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanks may look intimidating, but their mobility was limited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially when focusing on a single target, they couldn't hold a candle to a skilled fighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer force of the tank shells was terrifying, but none of them hit Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Shadow Step, he danced around the incoming fire, evading every shot. As he moved, his hand never stopped. The tiny submachine gun in his grip spat out deadly beams of light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang! Bang! Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beams of destruction slammed into the tanks' tracks, each hit sending a shockwave of violent energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, the tanks' tracks were obliterated, rendering them useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once-imposing war machines were now sitting ducks, unable to move an inch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smirked coldly, lifting his weapon toward the leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's face twisted in terror as he tried to dodge, his enhanced cyborg body&mdash; a 4th-generation model&mdash; granting him agility far beyond that of a normal human.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus was faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the man could make it even halfway to cover, the beam hit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a deafening explosion, followed by a burst of shrapnel and broken pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader of the Black Hawk Legion was reduced to nothing more than a mangled mess of flesh and metal. The battlefield was silent for a heartbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of their top commanders was dead, his body torn apart as if it had never been human at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus pushed forward, his submachine gun a death toll, firing relentlessly. Every shot claimed another Black Hawk Legion soldier, dropping them where they stood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he found himself standing before the Black Hawk Legion's ammunition depot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't hesitate. A series of blinding beams shot out, each one hitting its mark. The depot erupted into flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying explosion followed, the sound of it shaking the earth beneath him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A monstrous mushroom cloud spiraled into the sky, as the entire depot went up in a violent blaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shockwave flattened nearby buildings in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Screams filled the air, chaos spreading as Black Hawk Legion's forces were hit hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bring your commander out here, or I'll wipe every last one of you off the map!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' voice was cold, his words carrying the weight of impending death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground seemed to shake with the force of his command, vibrating in the ears of every soldier within range.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Black Hawk Legion was in shock. They couldn't believe what they were witnessing. Marcus wasn't just tough; his solo combat skills were off the charts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that gun&mdash;his submachine gun&mdash;was like something out of a nightmare. They'd never seen anything like it before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't just look lethal&mdash;it was. It was as if the tiny weapon had the firepower of a mortar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the way he fired it, non-stop, with no need to reload&mdash;it was like he had an endless supply of ammo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a weapon was unheard of, even in their world of advanced technology. Not even </span><span>Acoton's</span><span> top weapons manufacturers could dream up something like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How the hell is this guy doing this?" they thought, bewildered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a voice echoed through the chaos from a distance, cutting through the tension like a knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got guts, I'll give you that," the voice called out. "And your strength is impressive. But since you've come all this way, don't think you'll walk out of here alive. I've got more surprises in store for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Black Hawk Legion's commander and a handful of other high-ranking officials appeared, walking toward Marcus with purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind them were dozens of soldiers, their eyes blank, movements stiff and mechanical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't hesitate. His X-ray vision swept over them. What he saw took him by surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The soldiers weren't just cyborgs&mdash;they were something far more advanced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were 5th-generation cyborgs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mind raced at the realization. This wasn't something he'd expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Black Hawk Legion had 5th-gen cyborgs, and that meant serious trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The commanders spoke up, his voice dripping with cold confidence. "You're strong, I'll give you that. But how are you going to handle this? Let's see how long you last against all these 5th-gen cyborgs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sharp motion of his hand, the 5th-gen cyborgs sprang into action, encircling Marcus from all sides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus reacted instinctively, raising his weapon and firing. A beam of destruction shot out, tearing through the air and slamming into the body of one of the 5th-gen cyborgs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The explosion rocked the cyborg's body, but it only staggered for a moment. The damage? Minimal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The 5th-gen cyborgs aren't just tough&mdash;they're almost invulnerable," the commander continued, his face smug with victory. "Their defenses are three times stronger than the 4th-gen models. You can shoot all you want, but you won't even scratch them. Now, I'm dying to see what else you've got up your sleeve."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't respond. Instead, the rhythmic sound of his submachine gun firing again cut through the tension, the battle far from over.</span></p><div class="pagination">
