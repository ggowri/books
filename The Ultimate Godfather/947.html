  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And that's when he spotted her. Maximilian Lockwood, the husband of the raging woman in front of her, had his eyes on her from the moment she walked in.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man was a sleazebag, the kind who threw his money around and expected women to fall at his feet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But tonight's karaoke bar wasn't that kind of place&mdash;there were no working girls to keep him entertained.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Three drinks in, he was restless. Bored. And his gaze kept drifting back to Kiera.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That's when he sent someone over to fetch her&mdash;offering to pay for her company.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera couldn't believe what was happening&mdash;she felt like she was stuck in some twisted nightmare. She immediately turned him down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Maximilian wasn't about to take no for an answer. Without hesitation, he barged </span><span>into her room, grabbing her by the arm and pulling her towards his private booth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera fought back with all her strength, and her friends tried to talk Maximilian down, but it was no use.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His mind clouded by lust, Maximilian simply ignored their protests, dragging Kiera into the booth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maximilian was the executive vice president of </span><span>SiliconWave</span><span> Technologies, one of the largest corporations in Kingston.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Originally from </span><span>Solomia</span><span>, he was in Kingston for business, heading up his company's team for a deal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>SiliconWave</span><span> Technologies was worth hundreds of billions of dollars, and its stock had been climbing ever since it was acquired by Death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a result, Maximilian was well-known and respected, not only in Kingston but also in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had connections with all sorts of influential people in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>, including the owner of this bar, who, despite witnessing the situation, didn't dare interfere with Maximilian's actions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Maximilian was about to assault Kiera, he sent two security guards to stand by the door, making sure no one would interrupt him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera's friends were at a loss.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They even tried to call the police, but the lines were strangely busy, and no one answered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was obvious that Maximilian had probably arranged things with the police beforehand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This man was untouchable&mdash;his reach extended far beyond what anyone could imagine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To make things worse, when his wife arrived and saw Kiera, she immediately assumed the worst.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without even asking questions, she blamed Kiera for seducing her husband.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The way she twisted the truth was beyond belief, and the scene unfolded just as Marcus had witnessed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After listening to Kiera's story, Marcus' eyes narrowed, a cold glint flickering in them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To put it simply, Kiera came to the karaoke bar with her friends.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maximilian invited her to join him for drinks, but she refused.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't take no for an answer, dragging her into his booth and trying to make unwanted advances.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When his wife found out, instead of confronting her husband, she shifted all the blame onto Kiera, accusing her of trying to seduce him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was disgusting how easily the woman had turned the whole thing around on Kiera.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Marcus hadn't stepped in, Kiera would have been completely screwed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald... You need to understand. This man is the executive vice president of </span><span>SiliconWave</span><span> Technologies. He has major connections in Kingston and </span><span>Solomia</span><span>. Please, don't get involved. I don't want to bring trouble your way."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera's voice trembled as she spoke, her eyes red with the threat of tears. She couldn't bear the thought of Marcus getting caught up in this mess because of her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In her mind, Marcus was powerful, but not enough to take on someone like Maximilian or his massive corporation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She feared that if things got ugly, Marcus wouldn't stand a chance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry, I'm not going to let this slide. I'll make sure you get the justice you deserve," Marcus said firmly, his gaze steady and reassuring.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Fiona Lockwood, Maximilian's wife, who had been silently observing them, took in Marcus with a cold, assessing look. A sneer appeared on her face. "Who the hell are you? Some sort of knight in shining armor? Let me give you a piece of advice: stay out of this, or you'll end up just like this little slut&mdash;miserable and alone!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
