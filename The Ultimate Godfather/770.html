  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Marcus' body had already risen above sea level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He saw Nathan trying to forcefully pull Ada into his embrace, which instantly ignited a fiery anger within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You filthy bitch! How dare you resist me! Just give in, or you'll regret it!" Nathan shouted brazenly. With Alonzo backing him, he was convinced that he could do whatever he wanted here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he tightened his grip, trying to take full control of Ada. He wanted to take her home and make her his mistress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before he could pull Ada into his embrace, a destructive beam of light shot out from nowhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan didn't have time to react. With a muffled "thud," the light severed his arm in an instant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood splattered everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan let out a piercing scream, instinctively recoiling, his hand loosening its grip on Ada.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at his severed arm in horror, his eyes filled with panic and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone present was stunned by the sudden, brutal scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes turned to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus! It's him. He's really back!" someone in the crowd exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to Ada, Marcus had been exploring the underwater world for three days, and there had been no word from him since.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many had assumed he was dead, and no one expected him to reappear now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And what a dramatic return it was! His first move was to sever Nathan's arm. It was outrageously bold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus return unharmed, Ada's face lit up with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She realized that every time she faced danger, Marcus always showed up by her side at the perfect moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That sense of security was something no one else in the world could give her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alonzo's expression turned sour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had recently broken through to the Ancient Martial Stage Nine, placing him among the top practitioners in </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> world of Ancient Martial Art.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus had dared to cripple Nathan's arm right in front of him. It was a blatant provocation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Caster, Marcus has severed my arm! Please, punish him. Kill him right here!" Nathan cried out to Alonzo, clutching his bleeding wound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alonzo spoke coldly, "Don't worry. In </span><span>Uswad</span><span>, anyone who disrespects the Caster </span><span>family will pay a heavy price."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned his frosty gaze to Marcus. "So, you're Marcus?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Alonzo tried to use his spiritual senses to assess Marcus' strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his surprise, he couldn't see through Marcus' abilities at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's me. And you must be the head of the Caster family," Marcus replied calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you know who I am, why aren't you begging for mercy?" Alonzo said arrogantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow. Only then did he take note of Alonzo's recent breakthrough to the Ancient Martial Stage Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a slight smirk, he asked, "So, you're an Ancient Martial Stage Nine expert. Do you think that gives you the right to act like a tyrant?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada whispered a warning to Marcus. "Alonzo broke through to Stage Nine three days ago. His power has grown immensely. People are calling him the strongest in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>. Be careful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave her a reassuring look. When his eyes fell on her swollen cheek, a murderous intent surged in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Young man, since you know Mr. Caster has reached Stage Nine, why don't you just beg for mercy? Don't waste our time by putting up pointless resistance," Nathan sneered, his arrogance undiminished despite his severed arm. He thought that since Alonzo was here, Marcus would meet a miserable death today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could finish, Marcus took a step toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground trembled under his feet. The sheer force of Marcus' killing intent made everyone present feel a chill run down their spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan's bravado crumbled into terror. He stumbled backward, unable to believe Marcus would dare act against him in Alonzo's presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to hide behind Alonzo, but Marcus' hand moved through the air with dominating pressure, pinning him to the icy ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan's face went pale. He struggled desperately, but Marcus' strength was far beyond his comprehension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crushing force rendered him completely immobile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was terrified, struggling to believe their eyes. Marcus was far stronger and more imposing than anyone had anticipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that Marcus' power was even more terrifying than it had been three days ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alonzo's face turned icy. His voice carried a sharp chill. "Young man, release him now, or I'll tear you apart!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at him indifferently. Without a word, he channeled even more power into his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pressure increased severalfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the sound of bones cracking, Nathan's bones began to collapse under Marcus' relentless grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan screamed in agony, thrashing in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of Marcus, he was utterly powerless. He realized he had no chance of escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Caster, save me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With no options left, Nathan cried out to Alonzo for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, his bones were completely shattered. If Alonzo didn't act soon, he would most likely die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're courting death, boy! I'll kill you myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alonzo's voice was chilling, his fury palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He released a tremendous aura. The oppressive energy surrounded him, a testament to his power as a Stage Nine expert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rising into the air, he struck out with a destructive handprint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The massive handprint blotted out the sky, plunging the area into darkness. The space around them trembled violently as the attack unleashed its devastating force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The apocalyptic scene left the onlookers in despair. Many struggled to breathe under the suffocating pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam and the others were filled with dread. They finally understood the terrifying might of an Ancient Martial Stage Nine expert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was enough to make one's soul quiver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though they knew Marcus was strong, no one believed he could withstand Alonzo's assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You, prepare to die! You don't stand a chance against me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alonzo pushed the power of his handprint to the limit, giving Marcus no room to survive. He intended to obliterate him with a single strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus showed a cold smile. He said lightly, "Do you really think this handprint of yours is powerful?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
