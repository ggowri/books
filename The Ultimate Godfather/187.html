  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the alcohol flowing freely, the girls were in high spirits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, the more conservative among them began to loosen up, clinking glasses with Harvey and joining in the revelry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The alcohol worked its magic, loosening inhibitions and blurring the lines between decorum and abandon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina declared, "Ladies, did you know? There's a private swimming pool right here. We can drink and swim at the same time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her suggestion was met with enthusiastic agreement from the other girls, their eyes lighting up with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harvey seized the moment. "Get swimsuits ready for the ladies. Now!" he yelled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within minutes, the girls were slipping into their swimsuits, their skin gleaming under the lights. Their curves were a feast for the eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina and Judy, in particular, were statuesque, their figures rivaling those of runway models.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harvey, Troy, and Peter couldn't tear their eyes away, swallowing hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Natalia," Melina said. "Come on, let's go swimming. There are suits over there for you to change into. It's scorching out today, nothing wrong with cooling off a bit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She approached Natalia with a warm smile, extending an invitation with an air of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia shook her head firmly. "I don't want to swim. You guys go ahead and have fun."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina shrugged, not pressing the issue, and waded into the pool alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Troy and Peter exchanged a glance, stripped down to their swimsuits, and dove in as they splashed and played.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene was pure hedonism: white skin glistening, laughter echoing, and the air thick with temptation. It wasn't long before the guys began to cop a feel, their hands wandering where they shouldn't. But the girls, drunk and carefree, barely noticed. Their inhibitions were long gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The swimming pool was alive with the continuous symphony of laughter and playful splashes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching from the sidelines, Harvey sauntered over to Natalia. "Natalia," he said, "everyone's having a great time. We should join them. Sitting over here makes us look out of place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia gave a gentle shake of her head. "I've already let Melina know I'm not up for swimming. I'll just hang back here with Marcus for a bit. Once the party winds down, we'll head out together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing her words, Harvey felt a flicker of irritation and thought, "It's that blasted guy again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He yelled, "Since you're here, drop the act. I just don't get why this hick from Solomia deserves any courtesy from you. Come with me now, or don't expect me to play nice anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Harvey stepped into the familiar embrace of his own domain, the mask he wore </span><span>in the world outside slipped away, revealing the raw contours of his true self.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Natalia said she doesn't want to go. Are you deaf? Get lost."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Harvey could even reach for her, Marcus stepped in, shielding Natalia behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harvey froze and thought, "This hick had the audacity to stand up to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Troy, what the hell are you doing? Stop it, you filthy bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that very moment, Melina's voice pierced the air, her shouts echoing from the direction of the swimming pool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Troy had his arms wrapped around her waist, his hands roaming over her hot body, and let out crude and lecherous laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how fiercely Melina thrashed and protested, his grip only tightened, his actions growing bolder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus witnessed the distressing tableau, an invisible surge of Numinous Energy erupted from his fingertips with a flick of his fingers, striking Troy square in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Troy howled in pain, blood spilling from his mouth as his back teeth were knocked loose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the fuck? Who's hitting me?" he roared with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze locked onto Marcus with an icy precision, and his voice cut through the air like a chilled blade. "Hey, country boy," he sneered, "you're the mastermind here, aren't you? Do you have a death wish or something?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Troy and Peter stormed out of the pool as they advanced on Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia's heart raced as she watched the scene unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had seen Marcus fight before, but these men, Harvey, Troy, and Peter, weren't just ordinary troublemakers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She worried that Marcus might clash with them, only to find himself backed into a corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You hick!" Troy yelled, his voice dripping with venom as he stepped closer to Marcus. "Is this your little trick? Did you do this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No sooner had the words left Troy's mouth than Marcus slapped him hard. The force sent Troy sprawling to the ground, where he lay, crying out in shock and agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could Lester have raised someone as disgraceful as you?" Marcus growled coldly. "If he didn't teach you manners, then I'll do it for him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girls in the pool froze, unable to believe what they were seeing. Marcus, the quiet, unassuming man from Solomia, had just slapped Troy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After being pulled to safety, Melina stepped out of the pool with water cascading off her, quickly wrapping herself in a plush bath towel. She turned to Marcus, her eyes brimming with gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcus hadn't intervened, she didn't even want to imagine what might have happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get some men in here. Take this country bumpkin down! Beat him to a pulp!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Troy crumpled under the relentless blows, Harvey's heart seethed with a fury he could no longer contain. With a voice that trembled with suppressed rage, he commanded Alvin.</span></p><div class="pagination">
