        <h1>Chapter 625 A Mysterious Big Shot</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert's words promptly reminded everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Priced at a staggering 18.88 million dollars, the Tears of the Angel had an extremely restricted supply. Even the affluent might not be fortunate enough to obtain it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Marcus didn't look like a rich man at first glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And given the packaging of the Tears of the Angel, it resembled a knockoff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If your boyfriend can't afford it, it doesn't matter. Jade, he is such a liar. He actually used a fake product to fool you. It shows that he doesn't take you seriously at all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly. Break up with him right away. He can't hold a candle to Albert. He's even worse than many of our male classmates. Why do you insist on being with him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several girls were engaged in a discussion, their eyes brimming with sympathy towards Jade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were them, they would definitely break down on the spot when their boyfriends deceived them with counterfeit items on their birthdays.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, I am really surprised that Jade is with someone like you. Why did you try to fool her with a fake?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're short on funds, buy a gift worth three or five thousand dollars. I believe Jade won't blame you. It's far better than using fake goods to pull the wool over her eyes!" Albert said sarcastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he was overjoyed, fully convinced that he had effectively insulted Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as soon as he finished speaking, Marcus murmured, "I wonder why you have the courage to claim that the Tears of the Angel is a fake."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stunned, everyone stared at Marcus. Albert mocked, "Don't insist that the Tears of the Angel is real. To tell you the truth, I have just gone to a store in Solomia that sells the Tears of the Angel. A mysterious big shot purchased all the goods, including the Tears of the Angel that arrived this morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I am really curious when you obtained the Tears of the Angel. Was it a few days ago?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it doesn't make sense. Jade mentioned that she told you about her birthday today. How could you have bought the Tears of the Angel a few days ago?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Therefore, no one will accept your assertion that the Tears of the Angel is genuine. Your statements simply don't add up with the facts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people nodded in agreement, assuming that Albert had a point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That custom jewelry store was bought out by a mysterious big shot early in the morning. Where did Marcus get the Tears of the Angel?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, several girls initiated a conversation regarding the identity of the mysterious big shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who on earth was wealthy enough to purchase every single item in the jewelry store all at once?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How much did it cost?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a girl asked curiously, "Albert, you said that the jewelry store was bought out by a mysterious big shot. So, where on earth did you obtain the ring and that Angel's Kiss?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her question was unintentional.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Albert became embarrassed and explained in a panic, "I'm acquainted with some employees at the store. I deliberately asked them to hold these items for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus caught his expression and naturally understood the deeper meaning. He couldn't help but sneer inwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He advised, "Since you have alleged my Tears of the Angel is fake, I am going to call the staff from that store over now and have them assess the goods on the spot. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words excited everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had never expected him to be so confident that he took the initiative to summon the store staff to carry out a goods assessment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that the Tears of the Angel was real?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was absolutely impossible. Where did Marcus get so much money to afford such expensive jewelry?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert lacked confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason was simple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had indeed visited that very store moments ago, only to be informed that every piece of jewelry there had been snapped up by a mysterious big shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In desperation, Albert hatched a plan to pass off top-notch imitations as genuine articles. Both the Angel's Kiss and the diamond ring for Jade were nothing but high-quality fakes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It only cost less than ten thousand dollars in total, and they were perfectly identical to the real goods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the beginning, Albert experienced a twinge of guilt, feeling sorry for Luna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, the realization that he had truly saved a significant amount of money made him breathe a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saving money was the bottom line. There was no need to lavish so much money on picking up girls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he'd used a high-quality fake, Luna remained deeply in love with him. So why on earth should he shell out for the genuine article? From now on, he would only charm a girl with counterfeits!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if someone from that store showed up, he might be exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert thought, "No way. How could he summon the store staff? He isn't that influential at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, his Tears of the Angel must be a high-quality imitation like the one I bought. He definitely won't ask the staff to come over and examine the goods."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately felt at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So he said, "Well, if you have the guts, ask the staff to come over. Their examination will only expose your hypocritical nature!"</span></p></div>
