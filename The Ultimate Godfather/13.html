  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane rolled her eyes and nodded eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus kept shifting positions, sending shivers of pleasure through Jane's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After nearly an hour, their wild sex finally ended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane lay there, naked and panting, her body trembling with satisfaction. A deep blush colored her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The encounter had filled an emptiness inside her, making her crave him in ways she never imagined. She was totally dependent on him now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's over," Marcus said coolly. "Tell me what I want to know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a quick shower while Jane, still lost in the afterglow, tried to keep her eyes open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She managed to flash him a sultry smile. "They're at Winchester Villa outside town, living it up," she purred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes narrowed, suspicion creeping into his mind. "You sure you're not lying to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane pouted, "Oh, come on. You've served me well just now. Why would I lie?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Check it yourself. If I'm wrong, you can always come back and make me pay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she lunged at him playfully, but he wasn't having it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're lying," he warned, pushing her away, "I'll make sure you regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just turned on his heel and walked out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sweetheart, don't forget me. Next time, I'll even bring Natalia along..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane watched him leave, her eyes following his every step, already missing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her first words made his skin crawl. Not because he hated her, but because he was sick of being played like a damn puppet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the mention of Natalia... that piqued his interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Natalia isn't just young and gorgeous - she's absolutely a foul </span><span style="font-style: italic;">vixen who</span><span style="font-style: italic;">'</span><span style="font-style: italic;">s wild in sex</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Her masochistic streak perfectly matches my darker desires.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If Jane could really bring Natalia along, having both of them at once wouldn't be such a bad idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mind wandered to the intense pleasure that would bring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This perverse suggestion was too crazy, but Marcus was indeed desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been suppressing his desires for years, and with the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire amplifying his urges, resisting temptation was something he could</span><span>n</span><span>'</span><span>t</span><span> manage</span><span> now</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving the hotel, Marcus drove his car straight to Winchester Villa on the outskirts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car sped along the scenic Bayside Avenue, the ocean breeze whipping through his open window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, several black sedans shot out from the shadows at the intersection ahead, blocking the entire road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus slammed the brakes, barely avoiding a crash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Men in black suits poured out of the cars. Leading them was a tall, muscular figure with eagle-sharp eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Falcon - Anthony's infamous top assassin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus," Falcon's voice was cold, dripping with menace. "Your time is up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he finished his words, he signaled the men behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, they pulled out their weapons - daggers and guns all aimed at Marcus instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't say a word. He launched forward like a striking hawk, meeting the armed men head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fists were lightning fast, each punch cracking like thunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>BANG!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gunmen screamed as their arms shattered, bodies flying through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In seconds, Marcus had taken out every gunman, casually kicking the last gun into the ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he turned to the guys with daggers, tearing through them like a wolf through sheep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since advancing to Stage One of the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, he'd become unstoppable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With every swing of his fist, a man in black crumpled to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His strikes were brutal - anyone he hit either went down hard or didn't get up at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Falcon watched from afar, licking his lips with a cruel smile. He was getting more excited. This was going to be a real fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A minute later, all his men were down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus locked eyes with Falcon, tidying his sleeves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impressive," Falcon declared, eyes glinting dangerously. "You're stronger than I thought. But, you're still no match for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An explosive aura of a warrior at Stage One radiated from Falcon as he sneered.</span></p><div class="pagination">
