  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because you're stupid!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man in the red vest laughed triumphantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cooperated with the girl and could get hundreds of thousands of dollars in commissions from this order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was enough for him to live a carefree life for a year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And if Marcus had enough property on him, his commission might be even higher!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boy, give us what's on you, or we'll shoot you right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bearded man continued his threats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me where this place is first. Otherwise, even if I die, you can't know my bank </span><span>card password!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus spoke coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are about to become a slave, so it doesn't hurt to tell you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man sneered, "This is the Red River Mines. It's the final destination for fools!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's because of people like you that the Red River Mines business has been thriving!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus continued to ask tentatively, "Does it produce energy crystals? Why do you say that the business here has been booming?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bearded man said impatiently, "You are unpaid laborers, and we don't care whether you live or die. As long as you are still alive, you have to work until you die of exhaustion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for the energy crystals you mentioned, ordinary people </span><span>can not</span><span> touch them. You really think we know where they are. Funny!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just grab his stuff!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man in the red vest urged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bearded man wanted to search Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before he touched Marcus' body, Marcus threw a punch, hitting the bearded man's temple!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bearded man didn't even have time to scream before he was blown away and fell into the lake!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene immediately made the other two angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all raised their guns and were ready to shoot Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus took a quick step forward and stood directly in front of the two men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He punched another man, sent him flying, and then grabbed the man in the red vest by the throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the murderous intent released by Marcus, the man in the red vest was frightened and looked at Marcus with fear in his eyes, saying, "Don't kill me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before he could finish his words, Marcus broke his neck!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man in the red vest widened his eyes with despair and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never dreamed that the young man who looked harmless and even a little silly before would suddenly become so powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus dared to kill them on their territory!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man in the red vest regretted it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now it was too late!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Murder!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What happened here immediately attracted the attention of several guards not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They held guns and sounded the alarm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The urgent alarm sounded deep in the rainforest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the Red River Mines was alarmed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several guards immediately opened fire at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes became sharp, and he had already thought of destroying the mines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a quick move, he dodged the gunfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he picked up a pistol on the ground and pulled the trigger rhythmically!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Relying on his extraordinary perception, Marcus fired bullets with great accuracy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those guards had nowhere to hide, and several of them were shot dead on the spot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the influence of the alarm, more and more armed killers gathered here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of them had </span><span>Southvaia</span><span> faces and were quite well-trained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They took advantage of the terrain to shoot Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was not afraid at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having broken through the Ancient Martial Stage Four, he was now even more powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While dodging and moving, he shot at the target in front!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His firepower was far inferior to that of his enemies, but his shots were very accurate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time he fired, he would kill an enemy.</span></p><div class="pagination">
