        <h1>Chapter 533 Call Grandmaster Now</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two Stage Six ninjas, shocked by Marcus' overwhelming power, launched a coordinated attack. Their techniques, imbued with immense destructive force, flanked Marcus from both sides, compressing the space around him with deadly energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus stepped forward with his Shadow Step, and his movements were a blur of speed. In an instant, he unleashed two punches, each brimming with the power of Thunderfire Power, enhanced further by the Timeless Numinous Energy coursing through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the cultivation base of Ancient Martial Stage Seven, his attacks were far beyond what ordinary Stage Six ninjas could withstand. A deafening explosion echoed through the air as the two ninjas were thrown backward, blood spurting from their mouths as they hit the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stood frozen, and his eyes widened with disbelief. "You... you're an Ancient Martial Stage Seven expert!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His exclamation sent shockwaves through the other high-ranking members of the Society. They could hardly believe their ears. They thought, "A young man like Marcus has already reached Ancient Martial Stage Seven. It's absurd. Did he start cultivating from birth?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Call the Grandmaster now," One of the high-ranking elders roared in desperation. They all knew that even if they banded together, they were no match for Marcus. Only their Grandmaster might stand a chance against this monstrous power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before his words could fully echo, a destructive Hand Strike materialized in front of him. Desperation painted his face as he summoned his ninja arts to resist, but his defenses crumbled like paper. The Hand Strike smashed into him without mercy, obliterating him in an instant before he could even cry out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Alexander attacked. A ninja blade infused with sharp Blade Ray tore through the air with uncanny speed and precision. Alexander moved without warning, vanishing one moment and reappearing above Marcus the next, his blade poised to strike a killing blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus showed no fear. With a swift motion, he countered with a punch, and his fist radiated Numinous Energy and the devastating force of Thunderfire Power. The punch shattered the Blade Ray in an instant, sending Alexander hurtling back. He crashed into the wall of the grand hall with such force that cracks spider-webbed across its surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander coughed up blood, and his injuries were severe. He barely had time to recover when Marcus surged forward again. With Shadow Step, Marcus appeared right in front of him, and his figure was a blur of afterimages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another devastating punch came crashing down. Alexander's face pale with terror. He knew he stood no chance. The gap between their levels was insurmountable. Another ear-splitting explosion echoed as Marcus' attack shattered Alexander's defenses. His arm bones cracked under the pressure, leaving him writhing in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus grabbed Alexander by the throat, lifting him effortlessly off the ground. His voice was cold and unrelenting. "Did you ever imagine your life would end like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander struggled for breath, and his face turned a deep shade of purple. He managed to choke out a warning. "If you kill me, our Grandmaster will make sure you..." Before he could finish, Marcus twisted his neck with a sickening crack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's head lolled to the side, and his lifeless body hung limp. A stream of blood trickled from his lips as his life came to an unceremonious end. The remaining high-ranking members of Black Dragon Society were paralyzed with fear, and their earlier confidence was shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments ago, they had conspired to send experts after Marcus. Now, it was clear their efforts had only angered him further. If Alexander couldn't survive three moves against Marcus, what hope did they have?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Marcus unleashed another barrage of attacks, wiping out the remaining high-ranking members in mere moments. With Alexander and the leadership annihilated, the alarms finally blared across Black Dragon Society compound, signaling a major invasion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus stepped out of the grand hall, unfazed by the chaos. Ahead of him stretched a vast open plaza surrounded by Crankhurst-style buildings, their intricate architecture giving a sense of grandeur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the alarms continued, a sea of Black Dragon Society disciples flooded into the plaza, their expressions cold and determined as they locked eyes on Marcus. Then, a chilling pressure descended from the skies above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every disciple felt their breath catch in their throats, and their foreheads were slick with cold sweat. They looked up instinctively. Their eyes were drawn to a figure stepping through the air as though walking on solid ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The figure was an old man dressed in Crankhurst's traditional robes. His hair was stark white, yet his face remained youthful, an unsettling contrast that made him appear almost otherworldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You, Uswad boy, dared to kill my disciples. Today, I'll tear your limb," The old man's voice echoed across the plaza, high-pitched like a child's but infused with an overwhelming sonic force. The pressure in his words alone sent weaker disciples reeling, clutching their heads in agony as they collapsed to the ground, wailing in pain.</span></p></div>
