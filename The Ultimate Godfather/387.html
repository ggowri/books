        <h1>Chapter 386 Reminded Randy</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Kingston, the Whitman family was at the family cemetery. Barlow Whitman, the head of the family, wore a black suit and stood in front of a tomb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The senior members of the Whitman family stood behind Barlow. Everyone's face was full of grief and anger, and the atmosphere was depressing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The dead was Shaun. Today was the seventh day after Shaun's death, and everyone in the Whitman family came to pay tribute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A middle-aged woman with a noble temperament came over. Her eyes were red from crying, and she cried indignantly, "Mr. Whitman, please avenge Shaun's death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Barlow narrowed his eyes and said coldly, "I promise. Even though the murderer may have a close connection with Ryan, I won't let that person go. It is also someone that Roger wants to get rid of!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Roger has already made up his mind to kill that person. He may send some experts to Uswad in the near future. We only need to assist Roger. That person will definitely die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many members of the Whitman family felt relieved after they heard Barlow's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shaun was the only male in the Whitman family's direct lineage. However, Marcus killed Shaun. It was equivalent to cutting off the future of the family. Marcus was the Whitman family's absolutely irreconcilable enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver sent Randy to the hospital. Randy asked with a puzzled look, "Oliver, who on earth is that guy? Why are you so afraid of him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver had never hit Randy since Randy was a child. But yesterday, Oliver had actually slapped Randy because of that man. It made Randy feel so aggrieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver told Randy the details of the action that day. He knew that Randy would definitely not let it go unless he knew the truth. If Randy caused any more trouble, the Deleon family would definitely be implicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Deleon family was known as the top family in Uswad, but it was nothing when it faced the absolutely strong strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing what Oliver said, Randy was dumbfounded. He trembled all over uncontrollably and stammered in disbelief, "He... Is he really that powerful? Oliver, you are lying to me, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Randy's view, no one could match Oliver. However, according to Oliver's words, that man's strength was actually much stronger than Oliver's. Randy dared not imagine it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Didn't you see it before? Mr. Death gave me a pill, and my injuries all healed in an instant. Do you think such a person would be weak?" Oliver said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Randy recalled the scene and suddenly felt chill all over. He knew that he had offended a big shot, that even his family could not afford the price of offending him. However, he was still unaware of it and dared to provoke Marcus over and over again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Randy suddenly understood that if it weren't for Oliver, the result would have been even more terrible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver reminded Randy, "Remember, keep this matter a secret forever. Don't tell anyone in the family. You'd better not try to get revenge on Marcus. Otherwise, our family will be ruined."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Randy nodded obediently. He was willful, but he was not stupid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>According to what Oliver said, Marcus' strength had surpassed that of most people. Even if the Deleon family could invite some experts, they were definitely no match for Marcus,. By then, the Deleon family's situation would be even more miserable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Randy felt a little relieved and kept Oliver's reminder in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Early the following day, Josie woke up. After having sex with Marcus yesterday, her complexion looked pretty good today, and her skin seemed to have become more tender than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Marcus, Josie opened her arms and said sweetly, "Hug me, honey." Josie was naked. Her plump breasts shook as she leaned forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Josie was so sexy. Looking at her, Marcus had a surge of lust and pushed Josie to the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Josie smiled, "Ah... Honey, I just want to hug you. Oh, you have a hard-on again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't say anymore and kissed Josie. The sex lasted for an hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Josie lay on the bed and gasped, and soon, she fell asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Josie woke up again, Marcus had already bought breakfast. She felt a warm feeling and asked Marcus, "Honey, will you always be so good to me?" She blinked her beautiful eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course," Marcus smiled. Soon, he remembered something and asked Josie, "By the way, how is the magic practice I taught you last time going?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Upon hearing this, Josie showed a look of waiting for Marcus to praise her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Josie raised her hand, and a ball of fire rose in her palm, releasing bursts of magical energy. She said proudly, "I have mastered all the magic in 'Magic Codex'. Honey, am I good?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Good. Do you want to learn more powerful magic?" Marcus asked.</span></p></div>
