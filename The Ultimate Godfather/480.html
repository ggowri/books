  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus looked at Jade with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade suddenly snapped out of her daze, her body trembling violently. "I... I'm fine... I'm just really scared. Can you hold me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was clear she was truly terrified. Under normal circumstances, she would never have said something like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus nodded and pulled Jade gently into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A faint, sweet scent reached him, and Marcus couldn't help but take a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade didn't care about any of that now. Wrapped in Marcus' embrace, she finally felt a sense of security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's over. You don't need to be scared anymore. I took care of them," Marcus said, patting her shoulder to comfort her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade instinctively glanced toward the car window and noticed traces of fire burning not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Did you... kill all of them?" Jade asked, disbelief in her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She stared at Marcus in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In her mind, Marcus was just an exceptional doctor&mdash;she had never imagined him as someone capable of killing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes," Marcus replied calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade's gaze shifted, now filled with a hint of fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're not going to kill me, are you?" she asked suddenly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus chuckled and said, "Why would I kill you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm sorry, I didn't mean it that way. I'm just really scared," Jade apologized, guilt in her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why are you so scared of everything?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Because I grew up without a mom. My dad worked at the hospital and often had night shifts, so I was always alone at home," Jade explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In Solariae, it rained a lot. Thunderstorms scared me when I was home alone, and even as I grew up, I stayed afraid of things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'd imagine all kinds of scary things, and even though I knew it was just in my head, I couldn't stop myself," Jade spoke softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus finally understood&mdash;it was childhood trauma that left Jade with her fears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Coming from a single-parent family, she really was a pitiful girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her story, Marcus held her tighter, feeling an inexplicable urge to protect her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry. As long as I'm here, no one will hurt you," Marcus said gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade nodded slightly. Resting against Marcus' broad chest, she could feel the steady rhythm of his heartbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For her, it was a comforting sense of security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mm..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, a look of pain crossed Jade's face. She held her lower abdomen with her hand, looking uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's wrong?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade frowned, trying to endure the pain as she said, "When I get too scared, my lower abdomen starts hurting&mdash;it's probably related to my cramps...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's fine. I'll manage for a bit," she said, forcing herself through the discomfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade was already in significant pain but tried her best not to let Marcus see her suffering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus quickly activated his X-ray vision, focusing on Jade's lower abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He discovered that her reproductive organs had blocked meridians and poor blood flow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A chilling energy lingered inside, continuously affecting her organs. This was the root cause of her cramps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The intense fright had amplified the cold energy, making Jade experience the pain of her cramps prematurely whenever she was scared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you're okay with it, I can completely cure your cramps," Marcus offered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus hadn't intended to bring it up, but seeing how much pain Jade was in, he couldn't hold back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had previously cured Josie's cramps with great success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Josie no longer suffered from cramps and looked much healthier now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Holding Jade, Marcus could feel the cold energy radiating from her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If the cold energy wasn't removed, Jade's cramps would only worsen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The buildup of cold energy also affected her emotions, exacerbating her timidity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a vicious cycle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You can really cure my cramps?" Jade asked, disbelief evident in her tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked at Marcus skeptically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You already know I've treated late-stage cancer. What's a little cramp compared to that?" Marcus replied casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What kind of person are you? How do you have such incredible abilities?" Jade asked, tilting her head curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You'll find out over time," Marcus said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Okay, I'll trust you this time. But don't you dare take advantage of me," Jade warned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a doctor, she had a pretty good idea of what the treatment for cramps might involve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That's why she made sure to warn Marcus in advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she suspected him of crossing any lines, she'd stop the treatment immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus gave her a slight nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he carefully reached out and began to lower her pants bit by bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Jade had mentally prepared herself, the moment Marcus touched a sensitive area, she couldn't help but tense up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her body stiffened, and for a moment, she felt an urge to resist.</span></p><div class="pagination">
