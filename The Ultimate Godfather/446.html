        <h1>Chapter 445 Downfall</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who... who the hell are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tristan stared at Marcus, his voice shaking with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though Tristan was still in denial, anyone who could get his parents fired with a single phone call clearly wasn't the same person he thought he knew. Marcus was no longer the brat he had once imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You don't deserve to know who I am," Marcus replied with a confident, almost smug smile, as though he had already won the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When dealing with someone like Tristan, a small-time player, Marcus had a thousand ways to put him in his place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tristan, your parents just lost their jobs. What are we supposed to do now? You promised me a big house in Kingston&mdash;can we still afford that? What about our wedding?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tracy's face was filled with panic as she bombarded him with three questions in quick succession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tristan's eyes flashed with determination, as if the situation had sparked something in him. "Tracy, have you forgotten? I still have my business. I'm working with BioFusion Pharmaceuticals, and we're bringing in close to ten million dollars in profit each year. With that money, we can still take care of our parents, live comfortably... we'll be fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tracy hesitated for a moment but then reluctantly nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though they had just lost the salary from Tristan's parents, compared to others, Tristan's situation was still pretty solid. At least she knew they'd be financially secure in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"BioFusion Pharmaceuticals, huh? Well, your partnership with them is over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hadn't intended to get involved with Tristan, but Tristan kept poking at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The truth was, Tristan was Simon's family's biggest ally, and that made him someone Marcus had to make pay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tristan sneered. "Don't tell me you know people at BioFusion Pharmaceuticals too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't even bother responding. He simply picked up his phone and dialed Josie's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a quick conversation, Marcus learned everything he needed to know about Tristan's collaboration with BioFusion Pharmaceuticals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It turned out, Josie had only worked with Tristan because of his parents' connections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The parts Tristan supplied were mediocre at best, and there were dozens of suppliers who could replace him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without missing a beat, Marcus told Josie to cancel the deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Josie, of course, agreed right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Tristan saw Marcus hanging up the phone, he shot him a mocking look. "Don't tell me you were just talking to Ms. Shelman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No sooner had the words left his mouth than his phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tristan Harrold, right? This is the Parts Procurement Department at BioFusion Pharmaceuticals. We're calling to inform you that we are ending our partnership with you. There's no need to send the parts this week. You can come by the finance department to settle your outstanding balance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The voice on the other end was cold and final.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tristan stood frozen, his face filled with shock and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His mind was spinning. It felt as if the ground had been ripped out from under him. He collapsed to the floor, stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How... how is this possible? You even know Ms. Shelman... who the hell are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It felt like the entire world was crashing down on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One minute, his parents had been fired, and the next, his deal had been canceled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the blink of an eye, he had lost everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Marcus? With just two phone calls, he had made all of it happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Dowson family was left speechless, their faces filled with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tracy, now panicked beyond measure, turned to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are we going to do now? Your deal is gone! How are we supposed to get married now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In her desperation, Tracy's eyes landed on Jane, who had been standing nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her expression instantly shifted to one of desperation. "Jane, you have to ask your boyfriend to undo this! Tristan can't lose that deal, or neither of us will survive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Simon, swallowing his pride, approached Jane. "Please, Jane, for my sake, have mercy on Tristan. I know I was wrong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing her family beg so desperately, Jane felt a slight tug at her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She opened her mouth to speak, but Marcus shot her a look that stopped her in her tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane quickly swallowed her words, turning cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You really think you can come to me for help after what you did? When you tried to sell me off to Christopher, when you brought in the SWAT team to try to capture Marcus&mdash;what were you thinking then? Now you have the nerve to beg? Let me make it clear. I don't have the power to change Marcus' decisions. You'll have to face the consequences of your actions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tristan and the entire Dowson family were left stunned, their faces drained of color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, they were consumed by regret. They regretted ever looking down on Marcus and Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They should never have tried to sell Jane for that dowry of 1.88 million dollars, or tried to set up Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now they saw that Marcus was no ordinary man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With his connections, he could make things happen with a single phone call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was no way he could be the simple man they had once thought he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In all likelihood, he was some powerful figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And how could someone like that not have money?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they had treated Marcus and Jane with the respect they deserved from the beginning, maybe things would have turned out differently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The SWAT team was on their way to arrest them, and Tristan had lost everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were now facing the full consequences of their actions. Their downfall was complete.</span></p></div>
