        <h1>Chapter 525 He's Clearly Trained</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes sharply gleamed as he executed a precise sidekick that landed squarely on Isaac's torso. A dull sound echoed, and Isaac let out a muffled groan, stumbling backward. His face flushed red as he struggled to regain his balance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone gasped, "Damn, Isaac's a seventh-degree black belt in Karate, and this guy managed to land a direct hit on his stomach."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone echoed, "Yeah, he's clearly trained."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone shook his head. "It doesn't matter how skilled he is. He's crossed the Whitman family and the Griffin family of Crankhurst. He's a dead man walking." The crowd buzzed with chatter, casting sympathetic glances at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kingston University was one of the top schools in Uswad, full of hidden talents. Yet, Isaac and Patrick were notoriously untouchable figures on campus. Especially Isaac&mdash;not only was he of noble lineage, but his martial prowess far exceeded that of ordinary people. For Marcus to offend both men at once was considered sheer folly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac clutched his stomach as he staggered upright, and his gaze toward Marcus grew icier. From a distance, Patrick spat out garbled words through bloodied lips, "Isaac, this guy is way too cocky. You can't let him walk away. Beat him down and break his legs&mdash;anything to make him suffer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac gave Patrick a curt nod. "Don't worry. I underestimated him earlier, but now he's going to pay for it." Fixing his gaze on Marcus, Isaac sneered, "You Uswadian people are only good at cheap shots. If you've got any guts, face me in a fair fight, and I'll knock your teeth out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The irony of the accusation didn't escape the crowd, considering Isaac had been the one who ambushed Marcus earlier. But in twisting the truth, Crankhurstians were unrivaled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled coldly, "If that's how you want it, I'll give you a chance to fight me. If I can't defeat you in one move, I'll concede."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd murmured in disbelief at Marcus' confidence. Though many disliked Isaac, Marcus' audacity seemed reckless. Isaac was a seventh-degree black belt in Karate&mdash;one of the best fighters on campus. The earlier kick had likely caught Isaac off guard, but no one believed Marcus could win in a fair fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac, enraged by Marcus' taunts, roared and unleashed one of Karate's most powerful strikes, and his movements were quick and devastating. The force of his attack rippled through the air, a blow that would have been impossible for an ordinary person to withstand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus didn't even flinch. With a casual punch, he sent a Fist Ray hurtling toward Isaac. Isaac's body flew through the air, landing with a heavy thud over ten meters away. He screamed in pain as he crumpled to the ground, utterly incapacitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd collectively gasped, their gazes at Marcus now filled with shock and awe. Isaac&mdash;a seventh-degree black belt, a real master&mdash;had been defeated in a single move. If the earlier kick had been a lucky shot, this Fist Ray was a clear testament to Marcus' overwhelming strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac lay on the ground, writhing in agony. The punch had thoroughly robbed him of his ability to fight back. "You can't even withstand one strike. You're not worthy to be my opponent," Marcus said with a disdainful glance at Isaac. Without another word, he turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You lowly Uswadian scum! If you want to die, I'll grant your wish!" Isaac, humiliated beyond measure, was consumed by hatred. Just as Marcus took a step forward, Isaac pulled a gleaming dagger from his pocket and lunged toward him, aiming directly for his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted in alarm. "Isaac's going to kill him!" Everyone knew Isaac's infamous reputation. Not long ago, he had killed a Uswadian student over a girl outside the university.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under normal circumstances, the police or the university should have dealt him a harsh punishment. But thanks to the Griffin family's influence, Isaac had spent less than an hour at the police station before walking free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, if Isaac killed Marcus, the outcome was clear to everyone. Nothing would happen to him. In a world like this, fairness didn't exist. With Isaac's privileged status, even murder was trivial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as Isaac's blade was about to strike, Marcus moved with lightning speed. His eyes sharpened, and his hand shot out, clamping firmly around Isaac's wrist. Isaac struggled fiercely, but he couldn't break free from Marcus' iron grip.</span></p></div>
