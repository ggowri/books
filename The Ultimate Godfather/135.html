        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus returned to Bayside Villa, he found Natalia packing her belongings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curious, he asked her what she was up to and learned that she was preparing to return to Kingston for university.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Natalia, when do you plan on leaving?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tomorrow. Marcus, will you miss me?" Natalia asked, her eyes sparkling with affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course," Marcus replied with a smile and a nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just saying that!" she pouted, looking adorably cute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've been so busy lately, you hardly have time for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scratching his head, Marcus quickly tried to soothe her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew he had been swamped and hadn't seen Natalia often.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was just so much on his plate&mdash;he couldn't be in two places at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, Natalia, I ran into Abigail in Kingston," he mentioned, recalling his encounter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief pause, Natalia asked, "How is she? Is she doing okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, they were sisters, so Natalia still cared about Abigail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus recounted his meeting with Abigail at Vertex Plaza in detail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia sighed. "After everything that happened with Felix, she still hasn't learned her lesson? She's still dreaming of marrying into money. I just don't understand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But she is my sister, so I can only hope she finds a good guy soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia was kind-hearted; despite Abigail's past treatment of her, she still held concern for her sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, Marcus drove Natalia to the airport before calling Michelle to get the latest updates on Golden Group's business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle reported that TreatMed Pharmaceuticals had completely collapsed following Jared's death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although their partnership had ended, Golden Group's other ventures were thriving and setting sales records.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overall, their business was improving, with turnover up by one-third and projected net profits reaching 10 billion dollars this year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, Marcus visited the construction site of the pharmaceutical company for an inspection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to the hard work of Solomia Construction, everything was progressing smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several factory building frames were already up, and they were on track to finish in less than two weeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This advance meant that the overall timeline could be pushed forward by two and a half months, which was fantastic news for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had personally planned and overseen the construction of this factory, giving him a special attachment to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he left the construction site, Marcus went to check on the Serpent's Coil members who were practicing their magic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jalen, after mastering the Fireball and Lightning techniques, had been training tirelessly, even stepping back from the gang's battles to focus on his skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His dedication paid off&mdash;he had become proficient enough to easily take down ordinary fighters with a casual Fireball spell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jalen's rapid progress exceeded Marcus's expectations, showcasing a talent for magic that was far beyond what he had anticipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, Jalen's hard work was crucial. All in all, Marcus was quite satisfied with Jalen's training results.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus also identified several promising talents among the members practicing the magic classics.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These individuals displayed exceptional understanding and aptitude, mastering all the techniques in the books.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He formed them into a small team for individualized training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With nine members, each possessing extraordinary skills, Marcus instructed Jalen to teach them the Fireball and Lightning techniques for intensive practice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This way, they could quickly become true wizards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Edgar, the current head of the Serpent's Coil, didn't seem to have much aptitude for magic, which made him feel somewhat inferior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Observing his former subordinates surpassing him, he likely felt the pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus recognized this concern. Edgar had spent years in the underground world and was shrewd in business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had no intention of asking someone else to replace him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To stabilize Edgar, Marcus gifted him a martial arts manual he had gotten from Ricardo's Spatial Ring, encouraging him to hone his martial skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Fitzgerald!" Edgar exclaimed, tears of gratitude in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It reassured him that Marcus hadn't given up on him, sparking a renewed sense of hope as he committed to training day and night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overall, the members of the Serpent's Coil were surpassing Marcus's expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If everything continued on this path, within six months, the Serpent's Coil could dominate the Solomia underground world and become an unstoppable force.</span></p></div>
