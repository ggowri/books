  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Tucker family members were completely shaken. Their faces were as white as ghosts, and their eyes were wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie, standing closest to him, felt her legs go weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power Marcus had displayed was beyond anything she had imagined. It was like a force of nature, unstoppable and merciless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had once thought she might avenge Ada, but now, seeing Marcus so effortlessly destroy the three strongest figures in the Tucker family, she realized just how hopeless her situation was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of him, her strength was nothing. She couldn't even scratch the surface of his defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart raced uncontrollably as her mind went blank, the gravity of what had just happened sinking in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brett's voice quivered as he asked, "Who... who are you?" The shock was evident in his tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was hard to believe that such a powerful figure could have emerged from Uswad's Ancient Martial Art world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I already told you, you're not worthy to know who I am," Marcus replied coldly, showing no interest in further explaining himself to the Tucker family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brett's voice shook as he desperately pleaded, "We were wrong... We've crossed the line. If you could spare us, the Tucker family will swear eternal loyalty to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing Marcus' terrifying strength, he could only abandon all dignity and beg for his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the only way to give the Tucker family even a slim chance of survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave Brett a mocking look. "Funny how you weren't saying that before. You've been hell-bent on killing me. If I didn't have the strength I do, you'd already have gotten your wish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, you expect me to show mercy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brett's face fell as he realized the Tucker family's fate was sealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a last-ditch effort, he threatened, "You may not know this, but the Tucker family is deeply connected to the second son of the Godfather. If you harm us, he will never let you get away with it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was his final trump card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Years ago, Roger had come to the Kinton Mountains, overpowering everyone with his unmatched strength and forcing the Tucker family to submit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he hadn't appeared since, the Tucker family had always considered themselves under his protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with no other options, Brett invoked Roger's name, hoping it would intimidate Marcus into backing off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, smiled with disdain. "If you hadn't brought up him, maybe I'd have let this slide. But now that you have, I'm afraid the Tucker family has no place in Uswad anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A murderous aura radiated from him, chilling the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." Brett's voice faltered, his fear turning into fury. "If that's how it is, then we'll fight you to the death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing that even Roger's name couldn't sway Marcus, they had no choice but to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brett gripped a circular array disk that materialized in his hand, its surface etched with ancient runes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chanting under his breath, he activated the disk. The totems inscribed on it flared to life, and in an instant, they flew out, forming a massive totem in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It descended swiftly, merging with the land beneath it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground trembled as a blinding light enveloped the entire Tucker Estate, and an overwhelming array of energy filled the space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ancient patterns began to emerge on the earth, weaving together into a vast, deadly formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Tucker family has always had its secrets," Brett boasted, his arrogance evident as he stood surrounded by the pulsing energy. "You think you can just wipe us out? It won't be that simple."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The light from the formation bathed him, giving him the aura of a master of forbidden arts, formidable and untouchable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dragon's Wrath Formation!" one of the Tucker family members gasped in disbelief as he recognized the formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected this. Brett had unlocked the family's long-forgotten technique, one of the most powerful and destructive runes in their arsenal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Legend said that, in ancient times, a top-tier expert at the Return Essence stage had dared to invade the Tucker family's territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Tucker family had been on the brink of destruction, but at the last moment, the patriarch had unleashed the Dragon's Wrath Formation, slaying the intruder and solidifying the family's reputation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For over a thousand years, they hadn't faced a threat like that again.</span></p><div class="pagination">
