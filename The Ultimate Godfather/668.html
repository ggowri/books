  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the way to the hospital, Natalie briefly explained her mother's situation to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie's mother had stomach cancer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been discovered relatively early, and two-thirds of her stomach had been removed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, because her family didn't have enough money, they chose the cheapest surgical option, which was also the least effective.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant that while her mother had managed to survive, she was not fully cured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She required frequent hospitalizations, and the doctors had clearly told Natalie that, due to the unsuccessful surgery, her mother only had a few years left to live.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a high chance of the cancer cells returning in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recently, her mother had been hospitalized again, but due to financial difficulties, she hadn't opted for Solomia's top hospitals, like the Solomia Hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, she chose to stay at a lower-level hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only were the medical fees lower, but the reimbursement rates were also higher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Marcus drove up to the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to the crowded Solomia Hospital, this hospital had far fewer patients.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hallway outside the inpatient ward was nearly empty, with only a few patients walking around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hospital environment was a far cry from the large hospitals, with old and outdated buildings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was already past ten PM.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally, many patients would be resting by now, and even the nurses at the station were beginning to doze off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in Natalie's mother Mia Vance's room, the scene was entirely different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mia lay in bed, her face pale. A few doctors in white coats were desperately trying to resuscitate her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was filled with various medical machines, attracting the attention of patients in nearby beds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Doctor, what's happening to my mom?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie's expression immediately turned anxious when she saw this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The patient has experienced a sudden massive hemorrhage in the stomach and is currently in shock. It's a very critical situation. If not treated promptly, she could be in grave danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was just about to call you to come over, but I didn't expect you to come by chance!" a young male doctor wearing glasses said to Natalie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie asked in a panic, "But she was fine earlier today! How did she suddenly have a massive stomach hemorrhage? What happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor shook his head helplessly. "The initial surgery wasn't successful, as you know. And the cancer cells have begun to regrow. Unfortunately, the new growth is at the surgical incision site.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The incision has ruptured and become infected, leading to the massive hemorrhage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, you have two choices. First, we continue treating her here, but our hospital's equipment is outdated, and the chances of successful resuscitation are low.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Second, we transfer her immediately to Solomia Hospital for treatment. However, given her condition, the journey itself could be risky. She might not even make it there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think about these two options. Let me know your choice in the next minute."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the doctor turned back to continue his efforts to save Mia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie was on the verge of tears, unsure of what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was overwhelmed with regret, wishing she hadn't gone to that class reunion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If nothing else had happened, Natalie would have visited her mother every day after work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But today, because of the reunion, Mia had encouraged her to take the opportunity to rest at home for the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had seen that her mother was doing well, so she agreed. After all, the pressure from work had been quite heavy lately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she didn't rest, she would collapse herself and wouldn't be able to care for her mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who would have thought that, because of one night of relaxation, her mother would suffer a stomach hemorrhage?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. I can treat your mother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Natalie was feeling anxious, Marcus suddenly patted her on the shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Natalie could respond, Marcus had already walked over to Mia's bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctors who had been working on Mia froze for a moment, then shot Marcus disapproving glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young male doctor who had spoken to Natalie earlier sneered and said, "</span><span>Sir</span><span>, we're in the middle of performing life-saving measures. You'd better wait outside. The room is cramped, and you're interfering with our work."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus ignored the doctor's words. "If you follow your methods, you'll miss the best window for treatment. Immediately go to the blood bank and get a bag of blood that matches the patient's type!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctors stared at Marcus in surprise, and then their expressions turned dismissive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you out of your mind? We may be at a district-level hospital, but most of us have master's degrees or higher, and we have plenty of clinical experience. Do we really need you to tell us how to do our job?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said, "Do as I say, or it will be too late."</span></p><div class="pagination">
