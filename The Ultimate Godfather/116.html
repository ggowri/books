  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie gave a soft nod. "Marcus... I like you... From the moment I first saw you, there was something different about the way I felt. And after seeing you step in to protect me time and again, I realized I've completely fallen for you...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I didn't dare say anything because I felt I wasn't good enough for you. While you were gone these past ten days, I thought about you every single day. Now that you're here, it feels so good..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus wanted to say something, but Josie gently placed her finger on his lips. "Marcus, you don't have to say anything. I understand. You're younger than me, so outstanding, and I'm sure you have no shortage of women around you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've thought about this a lot these past few days. I used to be incredibly possessive, unwilling to share my love. But I know that a man as extraordinary as you can't belong to just one person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not capable of keeping you all to myself, and I don't want to. So even if something happens between us, I won't care how many other women are in your life. Just don't forget about me. Come see me now and then, and that's enough..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, Josie exuded an elegant, intellectual charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had to be said&mdash;she had gained a deep understanding of human relationships and viewed things with a refreshing clarity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, she had transformed from a conservative, morally constrained, and possessive woman into someone with progressive and liberated thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's heart ached even more; he hadn't expected Josie's feelings for him to run this deep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus... do you like me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie asked, her voice filled with emotion, alluring and soft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded instinctively. The intimate atmosphere peaked, as if the air itself was charged with desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I want you to love me... love me fiercely..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie spoke with unwavering determination, her expression filled with longing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't hold back any longer and kissed her deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mmm..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie let out a low moan, parting her lips and fully responding to his kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their tongues intertwined, exploring and savoring each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's hands didn't stay idle. They slipped beneath Josie's light robe, reaching for her full and perfectly shaped curves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie let out an irresistibly alluring sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The peaks of her curves were already firm and full of supple energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's fingers moved tenderly, and Josie's body trembled with every motion of his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her skin flushed all over, the light casting a glow that made her even more captivating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus turned her over, pinning Josie beneath him. He passionately kissed her neck while his hand ventured further down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hand traveled past her smooth, flat stomach, reaching the mysterious and enticing region beneath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a light touch, and Josie was already overwhelmed with sensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's finger broke through, slipping inside, while his other hand teased the sensitive spot just above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie could hardly endure the intensity of the sensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cries became rich with desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, it feels so good... I feel so empty down there..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie's words came out bold and unrestrained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before this, bound by her traditional mindset, she would never have said such things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with her late husband, she had never experienced this. Their interactions had always been routine and impersonal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, her marriage to her late husband had lasted less than a year before he passed away due to illness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Excluding the two months he spent in the hospital, Josie and her late husband had lived together for only about six months.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With both of them being busy with work and spending little time together, Josie's experience in such matters was minimal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Josie finally open her heart, Marcus intensified his actions, leaning down to kiss the sensitive peak of her curves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dual stimulation quickly brought Josie to her first peak of pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body quivered uncontrollably, and once again, waves of sensation overcame her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression was pure ecstasy. In five years, she had never experienced anything so fulfilling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to the emotional healing she'd experienced earlier, this intensity was far beyond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus kissed Josie, he gently removed the last piece of clothing she wore, revealing her stunning figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Marcus had suspected, even though Josie had given birth before, her figure was as perfect as a model's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was slender, yet every curve was exactly where it should be, especially her chest, which stood out so perfectly it was breathtaking!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her skin was flawless, without a single blemish or even a freckle, as perfect as a masterpiece.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, I can't take it anymore..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Completely overwhelmed by desire, Josie pressed frantic kisses to Marcus's broad chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gently parted Josie's legs, the alluring depths seeming to invite him in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leia's here. Let's go to the bedroom," Josie reminded softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie's voice brought him back to his senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus suddenly realized that Josie's daughter, Leia, was sound asleep nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He swept her up into his arms and carried her toward the bedroom...</span></p><div class="pagination">
