  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Um..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana snorted softly, and her face turned even redder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, are you also so rude when you are doing this with Jane?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus was stunned, not expecting Diana to ask such a question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without waiting for his answer, Diana said, "You are, right? I often hear Jane begging for mercy from you, but you never seem to listen to her. Instead, you make her cry even louder. You are such a bad guy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus was helpless. "You heard it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He and Jane had tried to keep their voices low when they had sex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unexpectedly, Diana still heard that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You two always did that at night. Of course, I could hear it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana glared at Marcus. "If I had known that you were so rude, I wouldn't have let you do this to me.."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus said with a wicked smile, "Didn't you say before that you wanted to do this with me? Why do you regret it now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana blushed and said, "I didn't. Mr. Fitzgerald, please don't say such shameful words. I will be embarrassed..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After that, Diana walked under the shower head and said to Marcus, "Mr. Fitzgerald, please go out first. I want to take a shower."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've seen your body. What are you afraid of?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus was somewhat puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No. Get out now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Diana's insistence, Marcus had to walk out of the bathroom. Just as he was about to return to his room, he saw Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Congratulations, honey. You finally got what you wanted."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane gave Marcus an ambiguous smile, looking up and down at Marcus' skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus raised his eyebrows slightly and pretended not to understand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't you know what you just did?" Jane smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus asked, "Didn't you go shopping? When did you come back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane smiled, "Half an hour ago. I heard all the noises in the bathroom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're such a voyeur!" Marcus cursed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I am obsessed with you. When I heard your majestic voice, I couldn't help but get aroused."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane threw a coquettish glance at Marcus, and while speaking, she leaned towards Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She pushed Marcus into the room and locked the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus had just had sex with Diana, and now he was blocked in the room by Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At Jane's age, her sexual needs were the strongest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she didn't see Marcus for a few days, she would feel empty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without getting Marcus' consent, she pulled down Marcus' pants and put his penis in her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, under Jane's teasing, Marcus became erect again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane lay on the bed and spread her long legs, revealing her private parts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Honey, you can't be partial. You have to give me the same thing you gave Diana just now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it were an ordinary man, he would not be able to have sex again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But as Marcus' cultivation continued to advance, his ability was far beyond that of ordinary men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Faced with Jane's temptation, his impulse came over him again. He pressed her under him and went into her private parts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It lasted for more than an hour, and Marcus finally ejaculated after Jane begged for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane collapsed weakly on the bed, gasping for breath. Her breasts trembled constantly, and sweat dripped from her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you satisfied now?" Marcus wiped the sweat from his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To please him, Jane learned a few new postures this time, and her skills were also much more mature than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus experienced a different feeling, and he was quite satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane nodded weakly, licking her lips with a look of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Honey, you are so great. I love you. Only you can satisfy me." Jane said in a soft voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then she half leaned on the bed and looked at Marcus lovingly. "Honey, do you have time these days?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus asked, "What's the matter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Next Wednesday, my dad will be celebrating his 70th birthday. I want to go back to see him. Since I married into the Winchester family, I haven't been home for five or six years." Jane said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You want me to go back with you?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane nodded. "My hometown is in Ganston, which is far away from here. Can you drive me back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was the first time Jane asked Marcus to do something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't want to go, but he couldn't find a reason to refuse her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Jane was with him, and it would be unreasonable if he refused her, so he had no choice but to agree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were still five days until next Wednesday, and Marcus wrote this matter down in his cell phone memo.</span></p><div class="pagination">
