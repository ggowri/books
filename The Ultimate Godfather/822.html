        <h1>Chapter 804 Grace Was Kind-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching as Nash's calf continued to bleed profusely, Kenia trembled all over in fright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never expected that Rodger would actually fire a gun at his own son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Rodger had aimed his shot directly at Nash's leg. It was a wound that might very well impair his mobility for the rest of his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That single fact revealed how terrified Rodger truly was. He feared that Nash's reckless act might drag down the entire Holden family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus merely glanced at Nash with a cool indifference and said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rodger wiped the sweat from his forehead and walked straight up to Marcus. He performed a crisp military salute and said respectfully, "I am Rodger Holden. Mr. Fitzgerald, good evening."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus shot Rodger a brief look and asked flatly, "You are Nash's father?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rodger nodded and replied, "Yes, my son was far too arrogant and was so stupid to offend you. Mr. Fitzgerald, please spare him. I am prepared to accept any punishment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus said, "You are also a senior officer. I cannot punish you. It is only your son who has clearly overstepped."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still wiping the sweat from his brow, Rodger hurriedly nodded. "Yes, Mr. Fitzgerald, you are right. I have spoiled this child since he was little, which is why he has become so overbearing. If you will forgive him, I promise to discipline him properly so that he never misbehaves again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied coolly, "Your son's nature isn't all bad. He merely fell under the bad influence of a woman of poor character."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, Rodger immediately realized who was truly at fault. His gaze turned icy as it fell upon Kenia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he told Marcus, "I will follow your advice, Mr. Fitzgerald. From now on, I will personally supervise who my son dates. I will not let him fool around any longer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Rodger's sincere tone, Marcus decided not to make a further issue of it. He waved his hand dismissively and said, "Let's forget it. Take him away, or he may become a cripple."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus hadn't expected Rodger to actually shoot his son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rodger was clearly desperate to gain Marcus' forgiveness, using everything at his disposal to do so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Rodger, a military officer, had apologized so earnestly, Marcus was willing to show mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grateful for the reprieve, Rodger quickly expressed his thanks. At that moment, all traces of his usual commanding presence had vanished, replaced by sheer deference and groveling subservience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without delay, he ordered his men to lift Nash into the car and rush him to the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, Rodger bid farewell to Marcus and left with his entourage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone present felt a chill in their hearts at the sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although they had long admired Marcus and knew that his position as Special Advisor carried considerable power, they never imagined that a military officer like Rodger would appear so abject in his presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were astonished that Rodger, in his effort to save his son, would go so far as to shoot him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all knew that Nash was Rodger's only son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was obvious to everyone that Rodger was at his wit's end. He had resorted to this desperate measure in hopes that Marcus would show him mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rodger's fear of Marcus was palpable, and the incident only served to elevate Marcus' reputation further among the onlookers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Nash was taken away by his father, Kenia's face crumbled completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nash was rescued by Rodger, but Kenia was left behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, Kenia had no idea what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mere thought of facing a military tribunal filled her with dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So overcome by panic, she lost control and wet herself, the sharp odor of urine wafting through the air.</span></p></div>
