  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila flushed with anger at Shawn's words, her eyes filled with disappointment. "Shawn, I can't believe how wrong I was about you. You've become so vulgar. Let me tell you something. Even Mr. Brooks shows respect to Mr. Fitzgerald. You'd better leave now, or you'll face serious consequences!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Shawn she once knew was bright and helpful, with a strong moral compass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, after being corrupted by the dark side of society, Shawn slowly turned toxic, reaching a point of no return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of loyalty to their shared hometown, Lila gave him this one warning. If he wouldn't listen, she'd done all she could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Shawn and his crew just laughed at her words with biting sarcasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some were laughing so hard they could barely breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You stupid bitch, this is hilarious. Who the hell do you think he is? The boss of the Axe Gang? Mr. Brooks? Like Mr. Brooks would even look at this piece of trash!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't even lie convincingly. He must be really something in bed for you to keep defending him like this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn's words dripped with mockery, becoming increasingly crude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others </span><span>wore</span><span> equally sneering expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Axe Gang was a notorious underground organization in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While not in the top three gangs, they weren't the type of people just anyone could claim to know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Shawn's mind, Marcus looked barely over twenty. How could he possibly command respect from the Axe Gang boss?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn wasn't buying Lila's story for a second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone </span><span>attack</span><span>! Break his limbs and throw him in the moat to feed the fish. I'll take full responsibility!" Shawn barked at his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, hatred had wholly blinded him. All he wanted was to tear Marcus to pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His men nodded immediately and charged forward despite Lila's protests, their </span><span>weapons slashing wildly at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each strike was vicious. They clearly weren't planning to leave him alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dangerous glint flashed in Marcus' eyes as he stopped holding back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped forward, diving straight into the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His massive fists struck like </span><span>sledgehammers,</span><span> each Fist Ray packed with crushing force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dull thuds of impact echoed through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Accompanied by the agonized screams of his attackers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than two minutes, Marcus had single-handedly laid out all of Shawn's delivery guys.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila watched from a distance, completely stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' movements weren't just efficient. They were graceful, almost beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd only seen moves like that in movies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never imagined someone could pull off such techniques in real life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her admiration for Marcus grew even more profound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn stood there dumbfounded, never dreaming the guy in front of him could fight like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus turned his cold gaze to Shawn. "You're next," he said flatly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Shawn could blink, Marcus was right in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cold sweat broke out on Shawn's forehead, but he wasn't a pushover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, he whipped out a knife and thrust it straight at Marcus' heart!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell, you jerk!" he snarled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strike was lightning-fast and caught most people off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An average person would've had no chance of dodging it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus was ready. His large hand clamped down on Shawn's wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a quick twist, there was a sickening crack of breaking bone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn's wrist snapped like a twig.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a blood-curdling scream, staring at Marcus with terrified eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I gave you a chance before, but you didn't take it. Don't blame me for getting nasty now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus towered over Shawn, looking down at him with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the words left his mouth, he snapped Shawn's other wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn howled in </span><span>agony,</span><span> his face contorted with pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus kicked him down the stairwell and said coldly, "Remember this. Don't ever mess with Lila again, or your wrists will be the least of your problems."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words dripped with menace, making everyone present shudder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected Marcus to be so ruthless and decisive in his actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn was sweating bullets, grimacing in pain, and didn't dare say another word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd seen the murderous intent in Marcus' eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed that if he spoke up again, Marcus would actually kill him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila stared at Marcus' commanding </span><span>figure,</span><span> her eyes filled with even more profound admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing behind Marcus, Lila felt safer than she ever had before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the past two years, she'd been constantly harassed by Shawn, who would often </span><span>show up at her doorstep looking for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd even gotten physically aggressive sometimes, and Lila had had enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for the fact they were from the same hometown, she would have called the cops long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, Marcus had finally solved this massive problem for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, you've helped me out again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila said to Marcus, </span><span>with </span><span>her face full of gratitude.</span></p><div class="pagination">
