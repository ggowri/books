Since you dared to hit me, I'll show you just how powerful my connections are!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel brandished a machete and said arrogantly, "I used to run with the underground crowd over a decade ago. I was Baron's right-hand man!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you heard of Baron? He's a big player in Kingston's underworld. But I guess you, being an outsider, wouldn't know him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you hit me, and today I, Daniel, will make sure to break both your hands!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel was boasting about his past glory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out he was a subordinate of Baron, who was a disciple of Edgar, the leader of the Seven Stars Association.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, at </span><span>BioFusion</span><span> Pharmaceuticals, Marcus had a clash with Walter from </span><span>AquaVital</span><span> Pharmaceuticals, and Walter had called in Baron for backup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had met Baron once before. Baron had heard of Marcus' reputation from Edgar and didn't dare to provoke him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus never expected to run into Baron's lackey here. He couldn't help but think how small the world was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel swung his machete at Marcus, taunting, "What's the matter? Cat got your tongue? Scared? Then apologize right now! Extend your hands so I can chop them off, and I might spare your life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A young man with red hair, Sam Brooks, chimed in, "Daniel, he looks like a stubborn fool. He won't just hand over his hands for us to chop off. Let's just take him down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel nodded eagerly, signaling to the dozen or so thugs behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were itching to get started. Having been paid by Daniel, they were ready to do their employer's bidding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wanted to wrap this up quickly because they had another job lined up afterward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the group of armed thugs charged at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These men were seasoned in the underground world, ruthless, and every strike aimed for the kill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Marcus didn't give them a chance. He launched a fierce counterattack, his fists flying like a tiger among sheep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within moments, the thugs were howling in pain, all of them sprawled on the ground, unable to get up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel was left dumbfounded, his eyes wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you're actually this strong?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold smirk, Marcus kicked Daniel to the ground, placing his foot on Daniel's head. "You mentioned Baron, right? Here, </span><span>take</span><span> a call!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus dialed Baron's number and held the phone to Daniel's ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, a respectful voice came through the line. "Hello, Mr. Fitzgerald! What can I do for you today? I'm at your service!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone could hear the deep respect in Baron's tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel stared at Marcus in disbelief. "How do you know Baron? Who the hell are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't bother to answer. He simply kicked Daniel, breaking one of his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel screamed, sweat pouring down his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had no intention of showing mercy. He lifted his foot again and shattered Daniel's legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel was in so much pain he nearly passed out, but he still had some grit left. Gritting his teeth, he replied coldly, "Kid, you're impressive. You've broken my limbs, </span><span>but you just attacked members of Axe Gang. I'll be waiting to see how long you can survive against them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus ignored him and stepped in front of Sam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam was trembling. Seeing Marcus' ruthless actions, he felt a surge of fear. He quickly threatened, "Even if you know Baron, you'll pay for attacking us from Axe Gang. Just so you know, I'm Blake Brooks' nephew. If you hurt me, he won't let you off the hook!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam wasn't lying. He really was related to Blake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Blake was an impartial man. Even with family, he treated everyone equally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam hadn't received any special treatment after joining Axe Gang, but now, feeling Marcus' terrifying strength, he had to use Blake's name to intimidate him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before he could finish his sentence, Marcus snapped one of his arms in an instant!</span></p><div class="pagination">
