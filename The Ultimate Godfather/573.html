  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren's avaricious voice sounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course. She's with me right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abraham smirked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he managed to introduce Lila to Darren, Darren would owe Abraham a favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren said, "Well, I'm coming to you right now. Lila is an absolute stunner. I've been lusting after her for a long, but I've never had the opportunity to make her acquaintance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I ever marry her, I'll be grateful to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Darren hung up and promptly led his entourage directly to the restaurant where Marcus and the others were gathered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Abraham, who was it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liz inquired with curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Darren. I've introduced Lila to him. He'll be arriving shortly. If this works out, you'll have to express your gratitude to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abraham spoke with a grin, roving over Liz's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Lila and Liz had inherited their father's genetic traits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were both exceedingly beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Liz and Abraham had entered into a relationship, they hadn't slept together yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liz immediately grasped the underlying meaning of Abraham's words and nodded shyly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was mentally prepared to sleep with Abraham.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Liz, did Abraham introduce someone to Lila?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacqueline asked with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mom. It is Darren from Team Tiger. He's a billionaire and will be here in no time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liz said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacqueline's face lit up with sudden elation, and she said, "Great! He's so wealthy! Thank you, Abraham."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liz nodded and said, "Yeah, Abraham is very capable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila gave an unhappy look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was aware that Jacqueline and Liz were trying to help her, but their behavior was out of line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila was disgusted and said, "Liz, my boyfriend is right here. I don't need you to do this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liz retorted, "Lila, your boyfriend doesn't deserve you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The person Abraham is introducing to you is Darren, a prominent figure worth billions of dollars. If you marry him, you'll be well off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And it would also give a significant boost to your acting career. You should be grateful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila was on the verge of speaking when she noticed </span><span>Marcus</span><span> gesturing to her. "Don't argue with them. I'll deal with it when Darren gets here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abraham and Liz heard Marcus' words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liz scoffed and said, "Abraham, did you hear that? He's overestimating his own capabilities!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abraham sneered and responded, "Although Darren may be advanced in years, he's ruthless. When he gets here, Marcus will lose big."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liz looked at Lila and said, "Lila, he's your boyfriend anyway. You should persuade him not to act rashly once Darren arrives. Otherwise, he'll live to regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila remembered Marcus' words and said no more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, the door to the private room was pushed open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tall and strong man strode in with several henchmen trailed behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Darren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon entering the room, he looked around the room as if looking for someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, his gaze settled on Lila, and he had a greedy look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Welcome. You've arrived with remarkable haste."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abraham greeted Darren with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you here to introduce me to a beauty? I'm eager to sleep with her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren grinned broadly and stared at Lila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is Lila, the star I've been eager to introduce to you. What do you think? She's even more captivating in person than in the videos, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abraham asked smugly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren nodded and replied with a smile, "Yes, she's far more enchanting than on screen. Thank you. I'll show my gratitude in due course!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Speaking, Darren actually approached Lila and said, "My dear, I've admired you for a long time. I promise I'll treat you right in the future. Come with me. We're getting married right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whilst speaking, he reached out to take Lila's wrist.</span></p><div class="pagination">
