  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hostess stepped onto the stage again and announced that Jared was the final bidder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's great. We've succeeded in the auction. You country bumpkin, daring to compete with my dad, you're still too green," Haley couldn't help but laugh out loud, and it felt as though half of the pent-up frustration in his chest had been released. He felt a wave of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Marcus with a triumphant gaze, but to his surprise, he found no trace of disappointment on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, Marcus was watching them with interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, what's wrong? Why aren't you happy at all?" Haley asked Jared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Brown family in Kingston only gave me three billion dollars, and the remaining six and a half billion dollars need to be borne by us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A few days ago, TreatMed Pharmaceuticals' stock took a nosedive, and its market value dropped by half. How could I come up with six and a half billion dollars?" Jared explained to Haley in a low voice, his face filled with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jared had intended to deliberately drive up the price, making Marcus spend much more buying the land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he had outsmarted himself and been tricked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Jared Brown, please pay nine and a half billion dollars, and the land will be yours!" the hostess reminded Jared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jared looked a bit flustered and said, "Today, I only brought five billion dollars with me, and I'll make up the remaining four and a half billion dollars another day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as these words left his mouth, everyone looked at Jared with strange eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he didn't have the money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bidding without the funds, the chairman of TreatMed Pharmaceuticals was quite shameless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, everyone who attended the auction knew that no bidder was allowed to maliciously drive up the price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If determined to be maliciously raising the price and disrupting the auction order, they would face a huge fine of five billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they refused to pay, the auction had the right to seize all the company's bank accounts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jared, of course, was aware of this. He just didn't expect to be outplayed by Marcus!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle glanced at Marcus's profile, her eyes filled with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She admired in her heart, "Mr. Fitzgerald is so formidable! He made Jared and Haley suffer in this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he has control over everything in the venue, which is just too smart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle truly admired Marcus from the bottom of her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Jared Brown, you are an old customer of the auction, and you should understand the rules. You can't pay later." The hostess' expression changed instantly upon hearing Jared's words, and her tone became cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since I am an old customer, please make an exception and give me half a month to gather the funds," Jared said with an ugly expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing the strange gazes of the crowd, he didn't care about his old face anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The rules of the auction cannot be changed by anyone! Even if you are an old customer, it's not possible! If you cannot pay nine and a half billion dollars today, then pay a fine of five billion dollars!" The hostess was unyielding and impartial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait a moment!" Jared, of course, would not admit defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked aside and made a phone call. "Hello, Sir, I've won the bid for that piece of land in Solomia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How much was the bid?" A deep voice came from the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nine and a half billion dollars..." Jared said in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the auction started, the maximum limit given to him by the Brown family in Kingston was five billion dollars. He had no confidence that they would allocate an additional four and a half billion dollars to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? How much? Say that again!" As expected, the voice on the phone was both surprised and angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nine...nine and a half billion dollars..." Jared's forehead was beaded with cold sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fool, didn't I set a limit for you before? Why didn't you do as I said?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jared argued, "This land is indeed rare, so I gave a little premium. I'm calling to ask the head of the family to allocate four and a half billion dollars to me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Jared could finish his sentence, the voice on the phone interrupted him, "Impossible! My money didn't come out of nowhere. It's certainly not for buying your mistakes! You figure out the four and a half billion yourself. You've been operating in Solomia for so many years; you must have some savings. If you can't gather it, then fend for yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, the phone only had a busy signal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jared slumped weakly onto his seat, feeling as if the sky had fallen!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recently, because Golden Group canceled their cooperation, the stock price fell, and the business suffered heavy losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The working capital was tight, and he really couldn't spare any more money to make up the four and a half billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, the Brown family in Kingston was his last trump card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they didn't care, he was completely out of options.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Jared Brown, when will the money be available?" On the stage, the hostess continued to urge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jared mechanically replied, "I can't gather it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The hostess' face darkened, "Then please pay a fine of five billion dollars, Mr. Jared Brown."</span></p><div class="pagination">
