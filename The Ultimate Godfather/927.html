        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For a moment, all kinds of sounds kept ringing in the room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The collision of their bodies and their moans complemented each other, filled with endless lust.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus turned her over and penetrated her directly from the front, starting to thrust more violently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon he made Cecilia climax again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And he lasted for more than 20 minutes in total.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, after Cecilia climaxed twice, Marcus finally came.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Cecilia only felt that she was filled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His semen was completely integrated into her body with great force.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecilia reached her climax again, collapsed weakly, and lay on the bed gasping for breath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus let out a long breath, and his whole body seemed to be released.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because Cecilia was a virgin, under this Dual Cultivation, Marcus' cultivation was actually raised to the peak of level three of the Acquired Return Essence Realm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was only one step away from advancing to Stage Four of the Acquired Return Essence Realm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And his strength was also raised to a new level at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Alison's cultivation had not improved, he would definitely be confident that he could defeat her now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was also a big surprise for Marcus after he came to </span><span>Acoton</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sat on the sofa smoking a cigarette.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a long time, Cecilia woke up from her semi-comatose state.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alison flashed her narrow eyes and said seductively, "Mr. Fitzgerald, this is my first time. My performance may not be perfect. I hope you don't mind. I will do better in the future."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her voice was extremely weak and pitiful, which made Marcus unable to help but hold her in his arms and say, "Don't say that. You have done well enough."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecilia asked, "Really?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus nodded and kissed Cecilia's forehead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecilia hugged Marcus' strong body tightly, as if she never wanted to be separated from him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecilia asked with some concern, "Mr. Fitzgerald, I gave myself to you. Do you think I am a slut?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She liked Marcus too much, so she didn't want him to think that there were flaws in her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wanted to try her best to show her best side to Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus said, "Don't think too much. I won't think of you like that. Don't worry."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecilia was relieved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But they didn't notice that Rhett was standing outside the door.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He seemed to have something to tell Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as he was about to raise his hand to knock on the door, he heard a sound in the room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He went to Cecilia's room just now but didn't see her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rhett realized immediately, and a knowing smile appeared on his wrinkled face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He turned and left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't seem to want to let Cecilia go. After some rest, he started to fuck her for the second time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It lasted longer than the last time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the previous experience, Cecilia seemed to be more relaxed than before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were completely immersed in endless lust.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, with the combined bonus of Dual Cultivation power and Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, Marcus made Cecilia climax seven more times.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecilia was extremely satisfied, and her whole body kept shaking on the bed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She seemed to lose consciousness for a short time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Through the second Dual Cultivation, Marcus also completely stabilized the </span><span>boundary.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next step was the Acquired Return Essence Realm Stage Four.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, Marcus predicted that he might have the strength to fight Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, this was only based on the premise that Diana did not have a strong ability to challenge a higher level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she also had a very powerful trump card, then Marcus would not be able to beat her.</span></p></div>
