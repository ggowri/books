  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, we still have some other matters to handle for the government, so we'll take our leave for now. If you need anything else, you can contact me anytime&mdash;I'm at your service 24/7," Amelia addressed Marcus respectfully, her eyes filled with deference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus stood up and gave her a nod of acknowledgment. Without another word, Amelia and her team departed. The fallout at Solomia High School due to Nora's unfair treatment of Marcus led to the collective investigation of Nora, George, and the academic director.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>News of this was bound to send shockwaves through the education sector, serving as a stern warning to educators involved in corruption and bribery. As for the parents who had mocked Marcus earlier, they were now utterly silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, this was a man who single-handedly reshaped the dynamics of Solomia High School. He was clearly not someone they could afford to provoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just realized something. That woman from earlier&mdash;wasn't she Amelia, Mayor Benjamin's assistant?" one parent whispered, their voice trembling slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone echoed, "Exactly. If Mayor Benjamin treats him with such respect, Mr. Fitzgerald's status must be far more prestigious than we imagined."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin, the mayor of Solomia, was a household name in local politics. No wonder Marcus had been so calm and composed in the face of Madeline. To Marcus, her arrogance was nothing more than the antics of a small-time clown&mdash;hardly worth his attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was laughable that Nora had been so blind, siding with Madeline all this time. And now, her blatant bias had landed her under investigation by the Department of Justice. This incident taught the parents an important lesson: never judge a book by its cover and never underestimate others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having handled everything at the school, Marcus didn't linger. He left Solomia High School and drove straight to the Cedars Villas. There, he shared a brief account of what had transpired at the parent-teacher meeting with Richard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As expected, his earlier hunch was correct. Richard had been feeling down during their phone call because of Nicole's mistreatment&mdash;being moved to the back of the classroom for no reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole had always been a diligent student, and coming to Solomia for school was supposed to be a fresh start. Instead, Nora had targeted her relentlessly, leaving Nicole </span><span>so demoralized that she was on the verge of depression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard had tried reasoning with Nora multiple times but got nowhere. That's why he had no choice but to ask Marcus to attend the meeting. Now that Marcus had resolved the issue, the entire family was overjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That evening, Marcus stayed at Cedars Villas for dinner. Since they had moved into the villa, Marcus hadn't had many chances to visit them. Even with his busy schedule, he felt it was important to spend quality time with his parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until 8:00 PM that Marcus returned to his own villa at Bayside. To avoid interruptions from Jane, he locked his door immediately. Then, he retrieved the three Spatial Rings he had acquired earlier. Starting with the ring from the Stage Four Ancient Martial Artist, Marcus felt a surge of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Stage Four martial artist was considered a powerhouse in </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> ancient martial arts community. It was no surprise that this individual's collection was exceptionally valuable. Inside the ring, Marcus found over a hundred pills, billions in cash, and a martial arts manual titled Shadow Step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just from the name, it was clear that this was a movement technique. Marcus' eyes lit up with excitement. While his offensive abilities were already formidable, his movement skills had always been lacking. Against opponents of equal strength, this wasn't much of an issue. But when facing true experts, the gap in agility became glaringly obvious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After skimming through the manual, Marcus memorized the core techniques of Shadow Step. The skill was divided into nine levels, with each level offering increasingly powerful enhancements. According to the manual, even a beginner could improve their movement speed by 20%.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though 20% might not sound like much, it could be the difference between victory and defeat in critical moments. Marcus decided that Shadow Step would be his primary focus for the foreseeable future. Aside from Shadow Step, the Spatial Ring contained few other noteworthy items, except for a golden scimitar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scimitar had proven its worth during battle&mdash;Marcus had used it to defeat two Stage Three Wizards. If he could pair the weapon with a proper blade technique, its power would be even more devastating. As for the Spatial Rings belonging to the two Wizards, Marcus discovered two brand-new magic spells: </span><span>Frostbind</span><span> and </span><span>Stormcall</span><span>.</span></p><div class="pagination">
