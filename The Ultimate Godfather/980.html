  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Mitchell, there's no need to be so polite. I'm simply acting on my duty to rid the people of a menace like Hank Foster," Marcus said with a smile, addressing Benjamin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since my return to Solomia from Kingston, I haven't had a chance to meet with you, Mr. Fitzgerald. Another time, I'll host and invite you to my home. I must personally thank you for the life-saving help you gave me last time!" Benjamin replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last time, when he was detained in Kingston, if it hadn't been for Marcus stepping in, Benjamin might never have been released. This only increased his gratitude toward Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Benjamin had heard the entire story from his daughter, Grace Mitchell. He had gained a deeper understanding of the power Marcus could wield. Even Commander Ashford, someone of great stature, valued Marcus and had appointed him as Uswad's Special Military Advisor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Benjamin look at Marcus with newfound respect. And now, Marcus had also removed Hank from the picture&mdash;an enormous obstacle for Benjamin. This was a great stroke of luck for him, not out of selfishness, but because Hank had been a significant hindrance to Solomia's development for many years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Hank was no longer in the way, Benjamin could finally focus on pushing Solomia's development forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin also confirmed something through his daughter&mdash;she was now Marcus's woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the daughter of the</span><span> </span><span>mayor of Solomia, Grace was expected to have her relationships approved by her parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now that she had become sexually involved with Marcus, Benjamin didn't feel anger or resentment. Instead, he felt overjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Marcus had other women besides Grace, but Benjamin was still content.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Marcus was a man of exceptional caliber&mdash;wealthy, with a higher rank than Benjamin himself, and a mysterious medical expertise that only added to his prestige. What father wouldn't be thrilled to have someone like that as a son-in-law?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Marcus had multiple relationships or did things that others might judge, Benjamin wouldn't mind. As long as Marcus treated his daughter well, that was all that mattered to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin had also learned from Grace that, thanks to Marcus's guidance, she had become proficient in ancient martial arts. These were just some of the perks that had appeared since she started her relationship with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew this was just the beginning. The deeper Grace's connection with Marcus grew, the more benefits would unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a father, Benjamin naturally wanted the best for his daughter. Not only had Marcus saved her life, but he would continue to bring her tremendous advantages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man like Marcus was exactly the type of person Benjamin could trust to spend his life with his daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, if I have time, I'll come visit you in person," Marcus agreed with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that he and Grace had that kind of relationship, the least he could do was show some respect to her father. It was only polite that Marcus accept the invitation, assuming his schedule allowed. It would not only strengthen their relationship but also show respect toward Grace in front of her father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing how respectful Benjamin was during his phone conversation with Marcus, both Kiera and Dustin couldn't help but shudder inwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Marcus had become someone who stood above not just the City Governer, but even regional military commanders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To put it bluntly, the official leader of Solomia was Benjamin, and the top military figure was </span><span>Ryker</span><span>. But those who truly understood the inner workings knew that neither of them held any real power compared to Marcus. Marcus was above them both.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this power structure at the core of it wasn't something the average person could comprehend.</span></p><div class="pagination">
