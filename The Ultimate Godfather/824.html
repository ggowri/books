        <h1>Chapter 805 Majestic Pines Estate</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Marcus, why didn't you let me know you came to Kingston? Don't you love me anymore?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia's message was sent as a voice note, her tone extremely sweet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was taken aback, slightly surprised as he asked: [How did you know I came to Kingston? Did you install a location tracker on me?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Marcus felt a chill run down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Did you forget? Your social media has an IP address. Your IP address is currently showing Kingston. You exposed yourself.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia replied with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Marcus realize, and he hurriedly opened his social media app to check, discovering that the IP address indeed displayed Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't expect Natalia to care about him so much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she wasn't keeping up with him continuously, it would have been impossible for her to notice such a small detail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[What have you been busy with? How have you been at school lately?] Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus recalled that he hadn't contacted Natalia for almost half a month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[I've been doing quite well, but I miss you a lot.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia's voice carried a hint of acting cute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Do you have time today? I'll take you out for a meal.]&nbsp;Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been a month since he last saw Natalia, and he truly missed her a little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Sure, I can change my class to meet you.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Marcus' words, Natalia immediately became enthusiastic and happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They agreed to meet at a restaurant near Kingston University.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After greeting Grace, Marcus headed straight to the restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon arriving, Marcus found that Natalia had already arrived first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia chose a seat by the window. Dressed in Kingston University uniform, she exuded youthful vitality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia's stunning face shone with a unique glow under the sunlight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, I'm over here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus walking towards her, Natalia quickly stood up and ran up to him, giving him a big hug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their bodies in close contact, Natalia's softness pressed against Marcus, bringing him immense pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He noticed that since they hadn't seen each other for a month, Natalia seemed to have grown a bit bigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you wait long?" Marcus asked, feeling a bit shy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia shook her head vigorously, saying, "No. I'm just so happy you could come see me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them sat down, and exquisite dishes filled the table. Natalia ate heartily as if she hadn't had such delicious food in a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Natalia, eat slowly. If there's not enough food, we can order more," Marcus reminded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Natalia nodded while eating, in no time, one dish was completely devoured by her. With her cheeks stuffed, she looked incredibly cute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Delicious, really delicious!" Natalia praised as she ate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Natalia, is the food at your school cafeteria bad?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Marcus remember that he had never cared about Natalia's campus life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly felt a pang of guilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's good. It's just that I've become a bit tired of it after eating it for so long. It's the same few dishes every day," Natalia said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus then noticed that she seemed to have lost some weight recently, indicating that she might not be eating enough at school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could speak, Natalia said to him, "Marcus, I want to tell you something. I don't want to live in the school dormitory anymore. I want to rent my own place. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow and asked, "Why? Aren't you quite adjusted?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia's face flushed slightly, seemingly difficult to say, but finally told the truth. "Because someone in my dorm is in a relationship. That girl often brings her boyfriend to the dorm, without caring about how it affects me and the other girls. They make those embarrassing noises in the middle of the night, seriously affecting my sleep. My skin has gotten worse during this time, and I don't have the energy to attend classes. So I was thinking of moving out, plus I've had enough of the cafeteria food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, do you think that's okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Marcus couldn't help but laugh and felt sympathetic toward Natalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected her to suffer so much during her semester.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course that's fine, but don't rent a place. After we finish eating, I'll take you to buy a house, and then I'll hire a maid to cook for you every day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't bought Natalia a house in Kingston before because he wanted her to experience the school atmosphere properly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since living at school caused her so much distress, he definitely needed to help her solve the problem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's not, please. Houses in Kingston are so expensive. I could just rent a relatively new place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia didn't want Marcus to spend too much money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled and said, "You silly girl. Don't think about saving money for me. I'm not short of this right now, so don't worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus indeed had enough strength to say such things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus' abilities improved, he had been defeating opponents more frequently, and with his investments thriving, his bank balance was increasing at an astonishing rate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though houses in Kingston were very expensive, it was just a drop in the bucket for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, after having dinner, Marcus took Natalia to the nearest villa development from Kingston University.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The project was called Majestic Pines Estate, which sounded upscale and grand, and it was one of the few high-end renovated villa developments in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The renovation used high-end materials, and excellent designers created the spaces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, all these villas had been ventilated for over six months and underwent various professional formaldehyde removal operations before being put on the market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Marcus occasionally came to Kingston and planned to live in that villa in the future, he directly bought the largest villa in Majestic Pines Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The villa had five floors with a large area, costing Marcus 500 million Uswadian coins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in Kingston, this was undoubtedly a luxury residence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sales office at Majestic Pines Estate had high efficiency, completing all procedures in just two hours, and Marcus received the keys to the house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant that once they purchased some furniture and appliances, they could move in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The villa was registered under Natalia's name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although they no longer distinguished between themselves, Natalia was still very happy to have her own house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Majestic Pines Estate was about 2.5 miles away from Kingston University, making daily transportation a problem for Natalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Marcus decided to buy her a car for her convenience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia agreed cheerfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she was a girl, she always liked the Lamborghini brand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially the new Aventador model, which fascinated Natalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus saw that car, he also fell in love at first sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he didn't want to be too ostentatious, so he drove an Aston Martin himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Natalia liked Lamborghini, Marcus agreed to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two took a taxi to the Lamborghini dealership.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, upon arriving at the dealership, before they even entered, they were stopped by someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tall, well-groomed saleswoman approached them and politely asked Marcus and Natalia, "Excuse me, sir and miss, do you have an appointment?"</span></p></div>
