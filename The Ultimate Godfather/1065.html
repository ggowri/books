  <div class="container"><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Enough!&quot; Chloe&#x27;s sharp rebuke immediately cut off Thorne&#x27;s words.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I&#x27;ve already told you that I&#x27;m not breaking up with my boyfriend. Please show him some respect.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She added, &quot;And I need to make something clear to you! No matter how impressive you think you are, it has nothing to do with me. I, Chloe, will only love my boyfriend for my entire life.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Thorne&#x27;s expression darkened even more after hearing Chloe&#x27;s words.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Sure, he was somewhat older and quite average-looking. But his wealth, connections in Kingston, and his parents&#x27; positions as high-ranking government officials made up for that.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In Thorne&#x27;s mind, pursuing women was as simple as breathing.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He&#x27;d been with so many women that he couldn&#x27;t even keep count himself.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Women had eagerly thrown themselves at him with just a simple gesture.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Among them were even some entertainment industry starlets who were comparable in looks, though not as famous as Chloe.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Yet this woman before him preferred to stay with some bit-part actor rather than give him the time of day.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It filled Thorne&#x27;s heart with intense coldness.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He couldn&#x27;t help saying to Chloe, &quot;I honestly wonder what kind of spell this guy cast on you to make you so devoted to him.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">After speaking, Thorne&#x27;s gaze inevitably fell on Marcus as he said, &quot;Kid, care to share some of your secrets? How do you pick up girls? You&#x27;re just an extra, yet somehow you&#x27;ve got a huge star like Ms. Sinclair completely devoted to you. It really gets me curious.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Thorne&#x27;s ignorance didn&#x27;t anger Marcus. He smiled and said, &quot;What makes you so sure I&#x27;m just an extra?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Thorne smiled contemptuously as he said, &quot;Someone your age, with no money or connections in the entertainment industry—what else could you be doing? If not an extra, are you a janitor? Or perhaps a toilet scrubber?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Thorne couldn&#x27;t help but laugh, his smile dripping with sarcasm.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After his laughter subsided, Thorne looked at Marcus again and said, &quot;I get it. You&#x27;ve latched onto Ms. Sinclair like she&#x27;s your meal ticket, and naturally you don&#x27;t want to let go. So here&#x27;s the deal—name your price. As long as you dare to say it and it&#x27;s not too outrageous, I can satisfy your demands. Take the money, break up with Ms. Sinclair, and disappear from Solomia forever. How does that sound?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">As soon as he said this, Eulalia and Isolde couldn&#x27;t help but give Thorne a long, measuring look.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Isolde said, &quot;Thorne, you must really have your eye on Chloe if you&#x27;re willing to be so generous. This guy is getting quite the windfall!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She turned to Marcus and said, &quot;Hey, you&#x27;re only with Chloe for the money, right? Now Thorne is offering you cash, so hurry up and name your price. Once this opportunity passes, it won&#x27;t come again!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Eulalia addressed Thorne apologetically, &quot;Thorne, I just wanted to introduce you to someone nice. I never expected we&#x27;d run into this shameless opportunist. I&#x27;m sorry you have to waste your money like this!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Thorne waved his hand dismissively and said, &quot;Mrs. Sinclair, please don&#x27;t blame yourself. Problems that can be solved with money aren&#x27;t really problems at all. If he wants money, I&#x27;ll give him money. One way or another, Ms. Sinclair will be mine today!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Looking at the self-important Thorne, Marcus let out a sardonic smile as he said, &quot;I&#x27;m really curious—exactly how much money do you have that makes you so arrogant?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">When the topic of money came up, Thorne&#x27;s face radiated arrogance as he tilted his chin upward and said, &quot;This might shock you, but not counting my parents&#x27; savings, I personally have at least eight or nine hundred million dollars! Well? Are you surprised?&quot;</p><div class="pagination">
