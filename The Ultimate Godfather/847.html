  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Hannah and Molly playing the sympathy card, Josie softened a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, they had been very close during college, and she couldn't bear to see them suffer so much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Begging me won't help," Josie said. "You should be begging Marcus. He's the one who holds the power here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words snapped Hannah and Molly back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, they couldn't care less about their dignity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They bowed deeply to Marcus in front of everyone, apologizing humbly, "We're so sorry, Mr. Fitzgerald. Please forgive us for not recognizing you. Have mercy on us. If our husbands lose their core businesses, we won't be able to survive. Please!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These two women, who had been so arrogant before, were now incredibly humble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at Josie, who gave him a pleading look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He understood what she meant. "Since you've shown such a good attitude, I'll give you a chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to Hannah, he continued, "Jace has no other issues. I can restore his partnerships with Sync Group and Eastcomm Group. But Adrian's performance and attitude at work have been lacking. McHale Pharmaceuticals Group was already planning to remove him from his position within six months. Even I can't restore his old position. If he wants to get back to where he was, he'll have to work hard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's face fell with disappointment, but she didn't dare ask for more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as Adrian could keep his job at McHale Pharmaceuticals Group, she was grateful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus then made phone calls to Eastcomm Group, Sync Group, and Cecilia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jace's partnerships were restored, while Adrian was demoted but allowed to stay at McHale Pharmaceuticals Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to Cecilia, if Adrian improved his work attitude and skills, they would consider reinstating him as regional vice president.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had years of experience, despite his shortcomings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah and Molly were overjoyed and relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They showered Marcus with thanks, but he just brushed it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua, however, was still seething. Jace and Adrian had their positions restored, but he, also a classmate of Josie's, had been left out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but confront Marcus. "Since you've restored their husbands' positions, why not mine too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even now, Joshua didn't realize how rude he was being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was still arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked him up and down. "Think about what you've done before you talk to me like that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's face turned ashen. He realized Marcus had no intention of helping him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to plead, "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have crossed you, but you shouldn't be so ruthless either, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words sounded more like a demand than a plea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus almost laughed, "I have to be ruthless this time. Don't ever come near me again. Golden Pharmaceutical Manufacture will never work with you again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Joshua had shown genuine remorse, Marcus might have considered helping him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he was Josie's friend, and Marcus didn't want to make an enemy of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Joshua's continued arrogance left Marcus with no choice but to cut him off completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua felt utterly hopeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt like a cast-off failure, and his despair turned into burning hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed a steel fork from the table and lunged at Marcus. "You ruined my career, and now I'm going to kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Driven by sheer hatred, Joshua lost all reason. He raised the fork and stabbed down at Marcus' head!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His attack was meant to be deadly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden move sent a gasp through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one expected Joshua to be so unstable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch out!" Josie screamed, terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus' eyes flashed with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was now an Acquired State expert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, Joshua's movements were as slow as a snail's crawl, completely harmless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a casual flick of his hand, Marcus grabbed Joshua's wrist and pinned it firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's face twisted in agony as he struggled desperately to break free, but it was useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me go! Damn it! Fight me fairly. I'll knock your teeth out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua still spouted threats, seemingly unaware of the gravity of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think you have the right to challenge me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sneered. Until now, he hadn't wanted to seriously harm Joshua.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he was Josie's friend and just an ordinary person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Marcus, Joshua was like an ant under a giant's foot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But things were different now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua had tried to kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus hated people who wanted to kill him and couldn't bring himself to forgive such an attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a quick twist of his wrist, Marcus heard a sickening crack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's wrist snapped, the broken bone piercing through the skin, a gruesome sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua let out a shrill scream. He couldn't believe Marcus had such strength, breaking his wrist with a simple twist. What kind of person could do that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood gushed from the broken wrist, and Joshua nearly fainted from fear, screaming in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was stunned into silence. Some of the women screamed in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't believe Marcus had been so ruthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His strength was far beyond what they had imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's attack had been sudden, and most people wouldn't have been able to react in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus had easily grabbed his wrist and twisted his arm, breaking it. This was far beyond the capabilities of an ordinary person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me go! Let me go, or I'll call the police!" Joshua screamed, his eyes filled with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, Marcus kicked him in the stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua screamed again, his body curling up in pain, trembling uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't want to mess with you, but you kept pushing me and even tried to kill me. Not killing you is already a mercy. Get out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had no more patience for Joshua. He flung him away like trash. Joshua's body crashed into the wall nearby and slumped to the floor, unconscious.</span></p><div class="pagination">
