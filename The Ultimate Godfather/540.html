  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund walked up to Lila and whispered in her ear, "If you had just agreed to my offer that night, none of this would've happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But hey, it's not too late to change your mind. Clean up, meet me at the Hilton Hotel tonight, and I'll make sure you're the headliner at every event from here on out. You just have to make me comfortable. It's that simple."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entertainment industry was a dark, unforgiving world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For female stars, especially the stunningly beautiful ones, it was like walking through a minefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many were marked early on as prey by the industry's powerful figures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they wanted success, they often had to play by the unspoken rules.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any refusal would invite a wave of suppression, insidious tactics that they could barely defend themselves against.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One wrong move, one decision out of step, and years of hard work could crumble in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila was living proof of this harsh reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund, one of the industry's heavyweights, had set his sights on her. When she refused his advances, he retaliated by using every tool in his arsenal to block her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she wanted to survive, let alone thrive, in this business, compromise seemed like the only option.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Lila wasn't willing to sell her dignity. She found both Edmund and Tina utterly repulsive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Disgusting!" She shoved Edmund hard, sending him stumbling back a step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund's face darkened with fury. He glared at her, his voice cold and venomous. "You little bitch! You dare lay a hand on me? You've got a death wish! I'll make sure you're finished in this industry. Today, you'll pay for this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he called over a dozen security guards, signaling them to teach Lila a lesson right there on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entertainment world in </span><span>Uswad</span><span> was notoriously corrupt, with certain presidents having ties not only to business and political elites but even to criminal networks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund was exactly that type.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, Lila was just a pretty influencer, insignificant in the grand scheme of things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she'd dared to embarrass him and shove him in public, no less. If he didn't crush her, how could he save face?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the guards stormed the stage with intimidating glares, Lila froze in panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was just a young woman barely in her twenties, unprepared for this level of aggression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stellar Entertainment was backed by the powerful Burnett family, and no one dared to interfere even when Edmund openly bullied her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop right there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A voice from the crowd cut through the tension, drawing everyone's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus stepped onto the stage, positioning himself protectively in front of Lila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes widened in surprise. Of all people, it was Marcus who had come to her rescue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you crazy?" she whispered urgently. "Edmund is the head of Stellar Entertainment. His connections are massive. You don't want to get involved in this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't reply. Instead, he shot her a reassuring glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund narrowed his eyes, his tone mocking. "And who the hell are you? You want to play hero? Do you have any idea who you're messing with?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' gaze was calm, almost cold, as he looked Edmund up and down. "You're the head of an entertainment company, yet you openly coerce actresses and trick Lila into performing for you. You exploited her popularity for your own benefit, reneged on your agreement to let her be the headliner, and refused to pay her full appearance fee and penalty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your actions are already tarnishing Sync Group's reputation. How do you think the higher-ups will respond when they find out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had two reasons for stepping in. First, he felt a lingering guilt toward Lila due to a past car accident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Second, Edmund's despicable behavior had crossed a line. It was damaging Sync Group's interests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Edmund's series of despicable actions become public, the negative impact on Sync Group will undoubtedly be significant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As one of Sync Group's hidden shareholders, Marcus wasn't about to let parasites like Edmund harm his company's reputation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund's expression shifted, betraying a flicker of unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Marcus' words weren't baseless. If word of his underhanded dealings got out, it would undoubtedly impact Sync Group negatively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to Edmund, Marcus was just a nobody trying to bluff his way through. Whatever he said wasn't worth taking seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund quickly regained his composure, sneering. "You've got quite the imagination, kid. What's next? Are you going to tell me you're some big shot at Sync Group? Hilarious!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina, who had been standing off to the side with her arms crossed, strutted over in her high heels. Her gaze swept over Marcus disdainfully. "He's probably just one of Lila's diehard fans. Mr. Cross, don't waste your time arguing. Just have the guards beat him up and throw him out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund nodded, ready to give the order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could, Marcus said sharply, "I'll call Sync Group's executives right now. Let's see how they feel about canceling all your upcoming event funding and reclaiming every penny of your deposit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words hung in the air like a thunderclap. Edmund and Tina froze for a moment before bursting into derisive laughter.</span></p><div class="pagination">
