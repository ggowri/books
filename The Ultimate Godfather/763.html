Against Marcus' attack, they had no means of resistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could only submit to the slaughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the entire space was filled with various destructive powers, as if a hellish battlefield had appeared in the depths of the sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The waters turned crimson with blood, exuding a thick, bloody stench.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Nuer Tribe members watching from a distance felt their hearts shake violently, their scalps tingling with dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a massacre, an undeniably cruel massacre.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' power was utterly terrifying, to a degree beyond anyone's imagination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tribe as powerful as the Shark tribe was instantly wiped out </span><span>by</span><span> his attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, for the past 1,000 years, the Shark Tribe had always kept the Nuer Tribe firmly suppressed, leaving them no room to breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, even such a savage, bloodthirsty tribe with overwhelming power was nothing in the face of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That level of power completely overturned everyone's understanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than five minutes, all the members of the Shark Tribe were slaughtered by Marcus alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, his expression remained calm and indifferent. He slowly withdrew his Timeless </span><span>Numinous Energy, not the slightest bit affected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body slowly descended in front of the Nuer Tribe members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that the murderous intent surrounding Marcus was too overwhelming, causing the Nuer Tribe members to instinctively step back, fear creeping into their expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raphael took a deep breath, then lowered his head respectfully to Marcus, saying, "Mr. Fitzgerald, not only are your medical skills extraordinary, but you are also so powerful. I deeply admire you. Moreover, I am grateful that you lent your help in our tribe's time of crisis. Please allow me to show my respect!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Raphael lowered himself in a bow, his face filled with reverence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that, the other members of the Nuer Tribe followed suit, bowing before Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Ashton and his son, who had previously opposed Marcus the most, could only slightly lower their heads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had always thought of Marcus as nothing more than a useless human.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he mastered incredible medical skills, they believed it would not threaten their status in the tribe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after witnessing Marcus' terrifying strength, the father and son no longer dared to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They even realized that their previous actions against him had been incredibly foolish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Marcus' immense strength, not only the father and son but even the entire Nuer Tribe stood no chance against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he wanted to, he could wipe them all out with a single wave of his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, they foolishly kept claiming they would capture him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was practically just digging their own graves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Marcus was not the kind of person who enjoyed killing. Otherwise, the father and son would have already become corpses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under such circumstances, how could they still dare to act recklessly in front of him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia and Susan also lowered their heads in respect to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their beautiful eyes, there was not only respect but also a deep admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As young women in their twenties, they were naturally </span><span>drawn</span><span> to exceptional men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man like Marcus, with such extraordinary power, was naturally someone they could not help but be attracted to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially when they thought about the passionate </span><span>moments</span><span> they had shared with him, they couldn't help but blush.</span></p><div class="pagination">
