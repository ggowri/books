        <h1>Chapter 381 Breaking Ligaments</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nicholas trembled, cold sweat breaking out on his forehead from fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tony, I went out to handle something near our branch. You came to Solomia?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, I'm here discussing a partnership. What were you doing out? Why did you bring most of your guys?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tony continued questioning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Nothing, Tony. I'm coming back to see you now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nicholas tried to respond, but seeing his plan about to be exposed, he trembled even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wait there, send me your location. I'm coming to find you. If you move a bit, I'll break your legs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tony shouted, realizing Nicholas was deceiving him and secretly going against his orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nicholas tried to explain, but Tony hung up the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt like he'd fallen into an ice hole, quickly signaling his subordinates to stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The subordinates naturally didn't dare to take a move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Nicholas was torn and filled with regret for agreeing to Randy and his crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Tony arrived, his fate would be terrible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who are you, and how do you know about our Black Tiger Gang?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nicholas immediately realized Marcus was not simple and gritted his teeth, asking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus sneered and didn't want to answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, a fleet of business vans sped down the street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They stopped right in front of Marcus and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The car door opened, and Tony stepped out of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nicholas' face turned pale as he approached to greet him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Tony slapped him, knocking him to the ground, coldly saying, "I knew you were doing your own thing. You really disappointed me, treating my words like crap!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nicholas' cheek swelled from the slap, lying on the ground, looking pale. "Tony, I'm sorry. This is the only time. It won't happen again. Tony, considering I've been with the Black Tiger Gang for years, please forgive me once."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tony kicked Nicholas to the ground, saying, "If it happens again, I'll make you bleed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, he tried to get back into the van but caught sight of Marcus not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He shook as if struck by lightning. "...Mr. Fitzgerald..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When he fully saw Marcus' face, Tony's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He walked forward, bowed to Marcus, and respectfully said, "Mr. Fitzgerald, it's great to see you again. I'm so happy. How are you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This scene immediately stunned Randy, the others, and Nicholas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The onlookers also looked shocked and couldn't believe it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before this, they thought that when members of the Black Tiger Gang came, the young man would meet a bad fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But they didn't expect even Marcus, the leader of the Black Tiger Gang, to be so respectful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing his ingratiating manner almost made everyone drop their jaws, especially Randy and a few friends with him thought they were dreaming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They knew Marcus was just a local from Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Tony was the Oliver of Solariae's underground world. The two were in different fields and different cities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They wondered why they knew each other. Moreover, Tony treated Marcus with flattery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They acted like boss and subordinates. They wondered if this guy could also be part of the underground world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I came to take my friend home. As soon as we left the neighborhood, your guys blocked us here, and they even smashed my car."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus shrugged and said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tony was immediately filled with anger and turned his gaze back to Nicholas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That look nearly scared Nicholas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Nicholas, you messed up big time. Get over here right now and kneel to apologize to Mr. Fitzgerald!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His voice, like a clap of thunder, echoed in Nicholas' ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nicholas' expression completely darkened. He quickly ran to Marcus, knelt down directly, and kept bowing his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I didn't know you knew Tony. Otherwise, I wouldn't have dared to offend you. Please forgive me this time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nicholas bowed his head loudly, and blood started to seep from his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had been so arrogant towards Marcus before, but now he looked so pathetic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn you, you really make things hard for me. How could you offend Mr. Fitzgerald? Someone! Break his hands and legs, so he spends the rest of his life in bed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tony spoke coldly to Nicholas. He had seen how tough Marcus was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With one hit, he could kill an Ancient Martial Stage Two expert. Such a person, even if given 100 guts, wouldn't dare to mess with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, even if he killed Nicholas now, he couldn't ease his hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A few of his men immediately stepped forward, pinned Nicholas to the ground, and their daggers fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only the sounds of flesh being cut echoed, and with Nicholas' screams, his ligaments of hands and legs were severed.</span></p></div>
