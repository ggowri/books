        <h1>Chapter 670 Natalie's Loss</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had long heard of the Master Healer, a name widely known in the Uswad medical community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, they regarded him almost as a deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Never did they imagine that one day they would actually meet the Master Healer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What made them regret, however, was that despite the Master Healer being right before their eyes, they did not recognize him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Worse, they had spoken ill of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie's heart trembled again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had seen similar reports on major news websites before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There had been news of a Master Healer emerging in Uswad's medical field, who had miraculously cured patients with late-stage cancer, leukemia, heart attacks, and other complex diseases with a one hundred percent cure rate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Natalie had thought it was just a marketing ploy by certain pharmaceutical companies or hospitals, and she hadn't taken it seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, hearing Gavin's words, she finally understood that the Master Healer they were talking about was none other than Marcus, the high school classmate she had always looked down on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your mother's condition has completely recovered, but she still needs some time to rest and recuperate. During this period, you need to be extra careful. Make sure to feed her high-protein food and help her get plenty of rest," Marcus advised Natalie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie stiffly nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, it's getting late, and I should head back now. Tonight, you stay here at the hospital with your mother," Marcus said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he gave Mia a brief wave before turning and leaving the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Natalie watched Marcus leave, her beautiful eyes flickered. Her feelings were complicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Natalie, tell me, is it true that you and Marcus are just classmates?" Mia asked as soon as Marcus left, holding Natalie's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the hopeful expression on her mother's face, Natalie suddenly felt a sense of loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought again of what Marcus had said to her in the car, that he wouldn't take responsibility for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, don't worry. Just focus on getting better. I'll handle my own matters," Natalie replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was already past eleven PM when Marcus finally returned to Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was still working in the living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her desk was next to a large floor-to-ceiling window, with the bright moonlight gently bathing her. The serene beauty of the moonlight added an enchanting touch to Diana's already focused demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus quietly approached her from behind, then suddenly wrapped his arms around her waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana let out a soft grunt, instinctively trying to pull away. When she realized it was Marcus, she stopped resisting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, don't mess around. I still have work to do," Diana said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden touch caused Diana to gasp, her breath quickening, and her face flushed deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's so late. You should rest now. You can handle the work tomorrow," Marcus said with a grin before lifting Diana into his arms and carrying her toward the bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, you are so bad..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana struggled a little, but seeing that Marcus wasn't letting go, she eventually relaxed and allowed him to hold her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once inside the room, Marcus gently placed Diana on the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since she was at home, Diana wore only a loose nightgown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Marcus leaned in and kissed her red lips, making Diana's body stiffen as if she had been shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, there's the scent of another woman on you. Tell me, what did you do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her intuition was always incredibly sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She immediately sensed something was off with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Are you jealous?" Marcus asked with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shot him a sharp glare but remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that he was great in many ways, but he had a habit of flirting with other women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were countless women around him already.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a servant, Diana had no right to interfere with Marcus' personal life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the thought of him being affectionate with other women still made her feel a pang of jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Diana could react, Marcus kissed her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His large hand reached up to her breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Diana's body trembled violently. And her body became soft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana moaned softly and began to respond to his kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus directly took off her nightgown and found that Diana was not wearing any underwear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apart from the nightgown, she was completely naked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her smooth neck, breasts, flat belly, and mysterious area were all visible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the dim lighting, it only added to her mysterious allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' big hand reached directly into the mysterious area. It was already wet inside, and it kept shrinking with the movement of his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't take long for Diana's sexual desire to be aroused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned over, spread her legs, and sat directly on Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While she continuously sucking his nipple, her other hand began to move in a rhythmic motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus instantly felt a strong jolt, as if he had been shocked by electricity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana, however, didn't seem ready to stop there. She lowered her head and started her next movement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Marcus feel a different kind of impulse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He vaguely remembered that this seemed to be the first time Diana had made such a bold move.</span></p></div>
