  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In that case, please come with me," Vanessa made a gesture of invitation to Marcus with elegance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus gladly took her invitation and followed her with Cooke into the attic she had been in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This wooden attic was similar to the one in Red River Mines, and they all looked full of Southvaian beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vanessa poured coffee for them and sat opposite Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Through the split of her dress, they could peek at her fair, slender legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Judging from your appearance, you must come from the mainland, right? Are you here to purchase energy crystals?" Vanessa asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You truly have a keen eye, Ms. Tillman." Marcus nodded with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vanessa continued, "Since you want to buy the crystals, why not buy some cut ones? I have a bunch of top-class goods. How about we negotiate the price now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He blinked and got her hint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She must have discerned his supreme skill of gambling on stones and wanted to prevent him from buying more raw crystals as it would cause her to lose money and also disrupt the market order, which was not conducive to market development here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm afraid it depends on the discounts you can provide," he replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vanessa maintained her elegant smile. "I can tell you have a high standard on the quality of energy crystals, and they cost a lot. I'm sure you understand that you get what you pay for."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As their conversation continued, Marcus was increasingly sure about his previous guess of her intention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he asked tentatively, "What if I refuse?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was a crack in her perfect smile, but she managed to maintain it in a second. "Well, I can't help that. After all, all the deals are based on mutual willingness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Marcus stood up and said goodbye to her, "In that case, I have to pick up more raw crystals."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wait a minute!" Before he stepped up, she stopped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is there something else, Ms. Tillman?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vanessa said, "To be honest, I just run a relatively small business. If there's no rein in experts in gambles on stones like you, all the high-quality stones here will be in your pockets with rather low cost."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Meanwhile, other customers of mine will be upset about that, and my business will also be seriously impaired," she added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vanessa expressed her ideas while flattering Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had observed his strategy of picking raw crystals and concluded that his luck accounted for a large part of his successful selections in addition to his superb skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The reason she put it in this way was to reduce other's attention to Marcus since it would affect the Grand Fortune's business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are you suggesting? Am I not allowed to pick raw crystals here anymore?" Marcus asked her with a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Come on, I'm not an unreasonable person. Please come with me." As she said that, Vanessa walked behind the attic. There was the same door as the front door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Walking out of this door, they came to the backyard of the Grand Fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Compared with the front yard, the backyard was obviously much quieter, with only a few staff working here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vanessa pointed at a place and said, "There are one hundred raw crystals, and I now allow you to select ten of them, charging you only one billion dollars each in cash. After opening all the ten raw crystals, you can't gamble on stones here, no matter whether you make a profit or loss from it. How about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The one hundred raw crystals all looked in great quality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But only Vanessa knew that they all came from a dilapidated mine where the proven reserves of energy crystals there were almost exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In other words, Marcus wouldn't get many high-quality crystals this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>According to Vanessa's expectations, no matter how good he was at gambling on stones, he wouldn't make as much profit as he used to under limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Marcus glanced over all those raw crystals and nodded without hesitation. "I accept that, Ms. Tillman. I'll do as you told!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Aha, I like your straightforwardness." Vanessa finally breathed a sigh of relief as Marcus finally agreed to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, she was also curious if he could really select any supreme energy crystals out of these wastes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cooke now seemed to realize Vanessa's plot and reminded Marcus in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus just smiled at him with a nod since he had already discerned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vanessa had no idea of his incredible ability for X-ray vision!</span></p><div class="pagination">
