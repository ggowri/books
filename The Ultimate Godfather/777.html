        <h1>Chapter 773 Hidden State-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His strength grew once more, and the absorbed energy even accelerated his recovery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emboldened by the boost, Marcus launched another relentless assault on his next target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fought with a reckless strategy, trading blows to ensure he could eliminate each opponent one at a time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The process was brutal. One slip could cost him his life, yet Marcus gritted his teeth and endured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time he struck down the final figure, his strength had soared to an entirely new level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he stepped into the eighth challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As expected, this time, sixteen figures awaited him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with the experience he had gained in the seventh trial, Marcus navigated the battle with relative ease. Though the process was grueling, he managed to pass unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the light of the ninth trial ignited, Ada and Raphael, standing outside the massive castle, were overcome with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before this, they had thought reaching the sixth challenge was already a monumental feat. After all, it had broken the records of those before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't expected Marcus to have made it to the ninth trial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he succeeded, he would become the first person to conquer all nine challenges since the castle's creation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus fought with unstoppable momentum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The previous eight challenges had reshaped him completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when faced with eighteen versions of himself, he showed no fear, unleashing a level of power that defied imagination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took him less than five minutes to kill the first figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the surge of strength that followed, his confidence soared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the next ten minutes, he dismantled the remaining figures one by one, absorbing their energy into himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the final opponent fell, Marcus' power reached its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a deep breath, feeling as though his entire body was undergoing a transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Numinous Energy surged uncontrollably, while his energy channels and bones underwent a profound metamorphosis. He felt as though he was on the brink of a </span><span>breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on? I haven't even claimed the Return Essence Crystals, and I'm already advancing to the Return Essence Stage?" he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' face was filled with disbelief as the sensation of an impending breakthrough grew stronger by the second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not wanting to waste the opportunity, he sat down cross-legged and began channeling the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, absorbing the ambient energy in the space with abandon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the grimoire's guidance, he felt himself stepping into an entirely new state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This state transcended the Ancient Martial Stage Nine, yet fell short of the Return Essence Stage. It was a state between the two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always believed the Foundation Establishment Stage had only nine levels. It was a truth confirmed by countless practitioners before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conventionally, the next step after the ninth level was to use the Return Essence Crystals to ascend to the Return Essence Stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he had discovered a hidden state between the two. It was something entirely unfamiliar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Human, congratulations. You are the first to conquer the castle's trials.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Additionally, through your relentless combat experience and personal breakthroughs, you've unlocked the Hidden State between the Foundation Establishment Stage and the Return Essence Stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This will provide you with a more solid foundation and an advantage in battle against others of the same stage. You can even fight across stages now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus marveled at this newfound state, the ethereal voice returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hidden State?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The term was entirely foreign to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire hadn't mentioned it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From what the voice said, achieving this state seemed nearly impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curious, Marcus asked, "So, my current cultivation level is in the Hidden State between Foundation Establishment and Return Essence. But what does that mean for my combat strength? Can you explain?"</span></p></div>
