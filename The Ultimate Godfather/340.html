        <h1>Chapter 339 Job Fair</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Catherine, you look stunning today," Marcus couldn't help but compliment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine blushed slightly. "I was worried the recruiters wouldn't be impressed, so I decided to change up my style a bit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe this is the look you were always meant to have," Marcus teased with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After lunch, they headed to the nearby CBD business district.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This area was filled with towering skyscrapers, the financial hub of Solomia, home to the headquarters of many listed companies and multinational corporations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them visited several companies and got a general sense of the job opportunities and salary ranges in the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a prestigious graduate like Catherine, the typical salary was around 10,000 to 15,000 dollars per month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given her experience as a sales office manager, Catherine was also qualified for managerial positions, where the salary could range from 20,000 to 30,000 dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These positions often came with benefits like insurance, year-end bonuses, paid vacation&mdash;things that made them very appealing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Catherine, this was more than enough. She simply wanted a stable job, one that wouldn't leave her facing the risk of unemployment like her previous role, where once the real estate project sold out, her job could end too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, look over there! Sync Group is hiring for their Solomia branch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine pointed toward a building at the corner of the street, where colorful flags waved in the breeze and workers were bustling around, setting up for interviews.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A large banner hung across the building, reading: Sync Group: Uswad's Leading Emerging Industry Brand&mdash;Solomia Branch is Now Hiring!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow. Not long ago, Stephen, the president of Sync Group, had briefed him about the company's plans to expand into Solomia and invest billions to establish a local branch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had approved the project, and it seemed to be progressing smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The location for the branch had already been secured, and now they were in the hiring phase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, Sync Group is a leader in Kingston's emerging industries. Recently, after being acquired by someone called Death, their performance skyrocketed, and their market value has nearly tripled!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine continued, her voice filled with excitement. "I can't believe a company like Sync Group is opening a branch here in Solomia. It looks like they're almost done with the hiring process. I should've come earlier!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine's eyes lit up with anticipation as she grabbed Marcus' arm and led him toward the recruitment area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sync Group, one of the hottest emerging companies in recent months, was already a well-known name in Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many talented individuals had flocked to the area, eager to showcase their skills and join the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sync Group's compensation packages were among the best in the CBD business district.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even entry-level employees earned over 15,000 Uswad dollars a month, and managerial positions like the ones Catherine was eyeing could easily reach 30,000 or more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the scorching sun and temperatures above 30&deg;C, a long line of applicants stretched out in front of the building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recognizing that Catherine needed to prove her own worth, Marcus didn't get involved. The two of them stood in line for almost an hour before it was finally their turn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a staff member from Sync Group appeared, escorting a tall, graceful young woman toward the front of the line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Hope, you can join the line here. You'll be up next," the staff member said, guiding the woman into position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people behind them, some visibly frustrated, held their tongues.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many had seen this before&mdash;a clear case of someone with connections skipping the queue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those without money or power knew their protests would be futile and only risked upsetting the interviewers, so most chose to remain silent and endure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman, "Ms. Hope," turned to glance at the long line behind her, her expression a mix of smug satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Catherine was ahead of her in line, Marcus didn't say anything either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Catherine, is that you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman's voice suddenly rang out, a note of surprise in her tone as she recognized Catherine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine turned around, equally startled. "Gloria? What a coincidence! It's been, what, six or seven years since we last saw each other?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled warmly, genuinely happy to see an old face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman who had cut the line was none other than Gloria, Catherine's high school classmate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, Catherine's family had been struggling, and she was often overlooked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gloria, on the other hand, had been different. Her parents were successful business owners, and she had a well-off background.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gloria was stunningly beautiful, always fashionable, with a dominant personality and a knack for talking her way into things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By her second year, she had become the president of the student council, and her classmates had grown wary of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During high school, Catherine and Gloria had never been close. In fact, Catherine had often been bullied by Gloria and a few of the other girls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After graduation, the two had lost contact, and now, years later, here they were, bumping into each other at Sync Group's hiring event.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's been a while, hasn't it?" Gloria said with a bright smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze flickered over to Marcus, and she asked, almost absentmindedly, "Catherine, who's this? Your boyfriend?"</span></p></div>
