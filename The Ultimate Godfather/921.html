  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecilia grinned, "It was Mr. Fitzgerald who treated my congenital heart disease, Grandpa."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rhett turned back to Marcus, studying him intently before speaking again, his voice brimming with gratitude. "So, you're the savior Cecilia keeps talking about, Mr. Fitzgerald! Forgive my lack of manners!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, Rhett made a move to bow to Marcus. But before he could, Marcus reached out and steadied him. "No need for that, Sir McHale. It was nothing, really."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without giving Rhett and Cecilia a chance to say more, Marcus turned and walked over to </span><span>Ogder</span><span>. The man was still slumped on the ground. His body weakened from the gunshots he had taken to both legs at the hands of Joel's men.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Marcus approached, </span><span>Ogder</span><span> looked up at him, his eyes filled with both gratitude and admiration. Having witnessed Marcus' extraordinary abilities firsthand, his respect for him had only deepened. "Mr. Fitzgerald," </span><span>Ogder</span><span> said, his voice sincere, "thank you for saving the McHale family from the brink of disaster. I can't even begin to express my gratitude."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ogder</span><span> tried to struggle to his feet to show his respect to Marcus as he spoke. But Marcus stopped him and said, "Your leg is injured, no need to be so formal. Let me treat your wounds first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, Marcus once again released Timeless Numinous Energy. The energy surged in his palm and quickly wrapped around </span><span>Ogder's</span><span> left leg.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A moment later, a bullet was slowly drawn out from </span><span>Ogder's</span><span> leg. It was coated in dark blood, reeking of iron and gore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Logically speaking, having a bullet extracted should have been excruciating. Yet, </span><span>Ogder</span><span> didn't feel a thing. In fact, the moment the bullet was removed, he felt that his leg was significantly lighter as if a comforting warmth had wrapped around it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, Marcus increased the output of his Timeless Numinous Energy, pouring it rapidly into </span><span>Ogder's</span><span> leg. Under the influence of this energy, the damaged tissues began to regenerate at an astonishing speed, healing right before their eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This miraculous sight naturally caught the attention of Rhett and Cecilia. Not just them&mdash;others nearby had also gathered to watch, their faces frozen in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What they were witnessing was straight out of a movie or a fantasy novel. Seeing it happen in real life left their minds completely blank. None of them had ever imagined that such an extraordinary healing ability could actually exist in this world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In less than five minutes, </span><span>Ogder's</span><span> left leg had completely healed. There wasn't a single trace of injury left&mdash;no scars and even no lingering signs of trauma. The newly grown skin looked perfectly healthy like nothing had ever happened. It was nothing short of a miracle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus then moved on to treat </span><span>Ogder's</span><span> right leg, repeating the exact same process. Again, it took less than five minutes, and his right leg was as good as new.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone remained rooted to the spot, stunned speechless. Even </span><span>Ogder</span><span> himself looked utterly bewildered, as if he were trapped in a dream. Instinctively, he moved his legs, testing them. When he felt no discomfort at all, he hesitantly stood up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm healed... I'm really healed! Not just healed, my legs actually feel stronger than before I was shot! This is unreal!" </span><span>Ogder</span><span> exclaimed, his face filled with shock and disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, his gaze landed on Marcus, gratitude deepening in his eyes. Without hesitation, he bowed deeply and declared, "Mr. Fitzgerald, you've given me back my legs&mdash;this is a debt I can never repay. From this day forward, my life is yours. Just say the word, and I will go through fire and water for you without hesitation!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
