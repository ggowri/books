        <h1>Chapter 776 Stop Staring-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada snapped at Marcus, "You sleazeball! I knew you were going to say that... I'm... </span><span>I'm done with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Ada turned her back on him, completely cutting him off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus watched her stunning figure retreat and couldn't resist. He wrapped his arms around her from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Mmm</span><span>..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada's body gave a little shiver as she felt Marcus' broad chest against her back and the strength of his embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But surprisingly, she didn't pull away. She just let him hold her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, they were pressed together, body to body. A subtle, intoxicating fragrance drifted from her, filling Marcus' senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The feel of her soft curves against him sent a jolt of heat through his lower abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Down below, his body was making its own statement, pressing against her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that "statement" just happened to be right against the center of Ada's backside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada's eyebrows furrowed. She instantly knew what that hard object was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face flushed crimson, and her heart began to race. "Let... let go of me," she stammered. "You're... you're poking me. It's... uncomfortable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled, "It's not like I haven't done it before," he said, a playful smirk in his voice. "And it's not on purpose. It's just a normal guy thing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, his left hand snaked its way under Ada's robe, slowly sliding across her smooth, flat stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada's body gave an involuntary shiver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tried to sit up, to pull away, but Marcus held her down on the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hand continued its upward journey, reaching her full, firm breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because Ada had just taken a shower, she was wearing only her robe, leaving her breasts completely bare, with nothing underneath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And having just bathed, her skin was at its most incredibly soft and sensitive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The silky touch sent another surge of heat through Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're... you're so bad," Ada gasped, her body trembling violently, like she'd been hit by a jolt of electricity. Her breath came in ragged gasps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, of course, paid no attention to her words. His hand began to gently knead and caress her breast. "Man, it feels so good," he murmured, a hint of pure pleasure in his voice. "But I've never done this quite like this before... it definitely feels different."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, his hand continued its exploration, applying more pressure as he massaged her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus so brazenly utter such embarrassing things without even a hint of a blush, Ada wanted nothing more than to disappear into thin air. And as he spoke, his breath tickled her ear, sending shivers down her spine. Every nerve ending in her body seemed to come alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A seasoned pro like Marcus could definitely feel the shift in Ada's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hand began to teasingly play with her nipples, which were incredibly sensitive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each touch sent waves of intense sensation through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Mmm</span><span>... don't... please don't," Ada moaned, her voice barely a whisper. "I'm just staying here for the night. Why are you doing this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a little more teasing, Ada was completely undone, her breath coming in short, ragged gasps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing the moment was right, Marcus quickly unfastened the buttons of Ada's robe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, she didn't resist, letting him do as he pleased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus threw back the covers. Under the soft glow of the lamp, Ada's body was a masterpiece, breathtakingly beautiful and utterly flawless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She truly lived up to her reputation as the number one beauty in the world of Ancient Martial Art.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The previous times Marcus and Ada had been intimate, it had always been in the great outdoors.</span></p></div>
