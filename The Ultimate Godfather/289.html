  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go to hell!!" Asher roared. He channeled destructive force into his palm and aimed to annihilate Marcus with a single strike!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' face paled as he activated the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire to the extreme and merged Thunderfire Power with his Numinous Energy to unleash a terrifying counterattack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the energy erupted from his palm, Asher felt a sharp pain and had to withdraw his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus spat blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was a vast difference in their realms. Asher's attack had already inflicted significant injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You surprised me, kid. Now take another strike from me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At Asher's level, he could easily dispatch a junior at the Ancient Martial Stage Four, yet Marcus withstood his attack, which was astonishing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before he finished speaking, he formed an even more powerful palm print and struck at Marcus again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The force of this strike made the air tremble, threatening destruction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The expert at the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Five is indeed powerful. I can't match him," Marcus thought grimly as he activated the Shadow Step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His body created numerous afterimages and he dodged Asher's descending palm imprint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The palm missed, but the shockwave still pushed Marcus back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The gap in their powers was overwhelming and left Marcus feeling powerless for the first time in battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Asher, he felt like a mere insect, with each of Asher's attacks posing a deadly threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kid, let's see how long you can last!" Asher roared and chanted incantations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A pattern formed above him and quickly converged into a square formation that enveloped Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus felt himself bound by a powerful force and he slowed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Asher is a formidable Rune Crafter. This is the second time he's used a rune against me. He's really powerful!" Marcus thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Summoning all his strength, he struggled to break free, but the rune held firm, producing continuous rumbling sounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop struggling. This rune, the Four Symbols Circle, is hard to break even for those at the same level. As an Ancient Martial Stage Four warrior, you might as well accept your fate!" Asher laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then gathered destructive energy in his palm and released a blinding light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He shouted and the unprecedented destructive force directed against Marcus was neutralized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher aimed for a quick victory and channeled nearly all his destructive force into this strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the destructive force rushed toward him, Marcus felt helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go to hell! It's an honor to perish at my hands!" Asher sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Celestial Reversal!" Marcus roared just as the attack was about to hit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A brilliant light enveloped him, and the power of Celestial Reversal rebounded Asher's attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher, caught off guard, had no time to defend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By the time he reacted, it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The terrible attack fell directly on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A deafening sound echoed as Asher was blasted backward, blood spewing from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he didn't have the protection of the Silkworm Armour, the blow would have killed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Coughing violently, Asher rose and looked at Marcus with a heavy gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You actually managed to rebound my attack. How did you do that?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
