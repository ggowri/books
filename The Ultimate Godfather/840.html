        <h1>Chapter 820 True Nature Exposed</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her statement immediately aroused many approvals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah. Just like Hannah said, we would also like to know about his career. Come on, Josie, we will feel uneasy handing you over to him if Joshua is better than him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah. Josie, you keep telling us how good he is, so show us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These urges led Josie to glance at Marcus for his opinion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he nodded lightly to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Humility sometimes could bring trouble to a person in this cold, profit-oriented world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the sake of saving Marcus from trouble, Josie decided to show off at this very point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus is in charge of the Golden Group, a tycoon specializing in various fields with an annual turnover of thousands of billion dollars. I'm sure many of you have heard of it," said Josie confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she finished, all the chatters vanished, and everyone present goggled at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People who attended this party were all prominent in their fields. Although the noticeable Golden Group rang a bell with them, they never expected this giant's CEO to be such a young man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all thought, if Josie wasn't lying, that he might be too good for a divorced woman like Josie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, if he really runs the Golden Group, he absolutely deserves you. Cheers to you guys!" one of her old classmates said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was known to them all that Golden Group's turnover surpassed BioFusion Pharmaceuticals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, with its multiple operations, Golden Group would survive in fierce competition if it didn't fall into the trap of blind expansion as there were too many pillars for this company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for companies relying on a single industry, however, they could easily tumble with policy changes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why the person congratulated Josie. Soon, many of her old classmates joined that person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua, seeing exactly what was happening, gritted his teeth in resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his rage peaked, he clenched his fists and stood up. "Guys, I don't mean to be judgmental but as far as I know, the person in charge of the Golden Group is a lady called Michelle Smith rather than this man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing his words, the people present all looked shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah asked, "Joshua, are you serious? Don't kid us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nodding with a confident smile, Joshua replied, "Hannah, you know my firm has been doing business with the Golden Group. No one in this room knows more about this company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's words indeed made him more credible for Hannah and other people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Molly, who had been oddly silent all the time, suddenly started questioning Josie, "Josie, I really can't figure out what spell he cast on you to make you even lie for his face."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"People can google the senior managers of such a big corporation, you know? I can't believe you treat us like fools!" While saying that, Molly looked very disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her, this was not just a lie; Josie had failed all the care from her old classmates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Molly said was soon echoed by the other classmates as they all began to criticize Josie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them said, "I know he can't be CEO of such a giant. Look at him. He's just a young man from nowhere. Josie, you really let us down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another one couldn't help but ask, "I still can't understand why such an honest, upright girl would lie for this nobody. What kind of magic does he have?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, you don't understand. Women at our age always easily fall for a young, sweet, and handsome man. I can tell that he's like that kind of man. Josie must be fooled by him!" said another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All these doubts and disdain boosted Joshua's confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Josie, he had already been out of the list of her boyfriends. He just couldn't stand that Marcus would have the woman he couldn't have.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The envy drove him to embarrass Marcus in front of all these people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing these bitter questions, Josie looked more and more awkward and hurriedly explained, "No, it's not like that at all. I didn't lie about Marcus' ownership of the Golden Group. The Michelle Joshua just mentioned worked for Marcus. If you still choose to doubt him, just do it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her explanation, however, didn't resolve the misunderstanding but made Molly and Hannah feel more disappointed at seeing their bestie being fascinated with a loser.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Molly couldn't stand the mess and stood up while warning Marcus, "I don't know what kind of spell you cast on Josie, but I can see you're smart enough to realize that you don't deserve her. Choose wisely, and leave her as soon as possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Molly's courteous mask shed, Hannah also left her seat and said, "That's what I want to say. Leave her right now. I assume a young man like you must pester her for money. Here's the case: if you leave her, I'll offer you some money that will guarantee you a rich life. How about it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Molly echoed her, "You can get 10 million dollars from us if you leave Josie. This amount of money will absolutely sustain a lavish life for you. Don't miss the boat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their way too generous offer shocked everyone here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one ever expected them to pay such an enormous amount of money just to get rid of an unpleasant man for their bestie!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although ten million dollars was Molly's and Hannah's pocket money, it demonstrated how sincerely they cared about Josie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, they would try everything they could do for Josie's happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Josie didn't want to appreciate their care and looked offended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment she was about to refute, Marcus comforted Josie with his eyes and said, "You think 10 million dollars can sever my love for Josie?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The insinuation in his words led Molly and Hannah to look at each other with a tacit smile of mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His true nature was exposed in the face of so much money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah said, "It's not enough for you, is it? Well, just say a number. Save both our time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, everyone focused on Marcus, wondering how he was going to blackmail Molly and Hannah.</span></p></div>
