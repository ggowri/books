        <h1>Chapter 295 Regret</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Lisa, I bought this car. I had an Alphard before, but it was scrapped, so I drove this. How about this? I'll get a few cabs now," Marcus explained without hiding anything, and he just told the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus was just bragging in Lisa's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She rolled her eyes helplessly and told Aria, "Mom, look at him. Even if we came to Uncle Richard's house, we'd need a cab to the hospital, so what's the point of us coming here? Are we here to watch Marcus show off his wealth?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Lisa finished speaking, Aria lowered her head and began to regret it in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why don't you have Allan come over and pick us up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lisa nodded and told everyone, "There are so many people here, so I asked my boyfriend Allan to come and pick us up. He's attending a wedding nearby, so he'll be here soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Lisa dialed Allan's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Allan was nearby, not far from them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Also, the wedding was almost over, so Allan agreed to Lisa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a while, a white Sienna commercial vehicle was driven into the Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A tall man with a buzz cut and a suit got out of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was none other than Lisa's boyfriend, Allan Ames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Allan was a native of Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His parents were both public officials who earned high and stable incomes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't do well when he was a child, and he didn't apply to college, so he went to work at the wholesale market. With his connections, Allan rose to the position of deputy manager.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a salary of over two hundred thousand dollars a year, Allan was now at the elite level in Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More importantly, as a local native and with his parents' connections, Allan knew a lot of people, so he had friends in many different industries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Lisa say he needed to pick up several people, Allan drove his friend's Toyota Sienna over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Allan, you're here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In truth, Nick and Aria were even close to Allan as if he were their son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Allan, their eyes were filled with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, why didn't you tell me in advance when you came to Solomia? I could have sent a company car to pick you up at the train station."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Allan nodded at Nick and Aria with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We came over to Richard's house. We weren't going to bother you, and you were busy with your usual work, so we took a cab here," Aria said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Allan, this is Richard, Melinda, and Marcus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nick immediately introduced them to Allan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Allan glanced at the grand villa in front of him before greeting Richard, Melinda, and Marcus respectively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The houses in Cedars Villas are expensive, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Allan said enviously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah. It's worth eight million dollars, but I have sort of forgotten the exact price," Marcus replied calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Allan, Richard and Melinda couldn't help but take a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eight million dollars was the money an ordinary person would never earn in a lifetime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Richard and his family were now living in a villa worth eight million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Honey, is this villa truly worth so much money?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lisa asked Allan in a whisper, feeling even more jealous inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Allan nodded. "Richard is so rich!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the deputy manager of the wholesale market, Allan had seen the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were even tens of millions of dollars in Cedars Villas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at the location of this villa, eight million dollars was considered a bargain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are they rich? I told you before that Marcus lived at his wife's house, so the villa was definitely bought by his rich wife. How could their family afford it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lisa said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh, alright."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Allan immediately realized what Lisa meant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't help but look at Marcus deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Allan thought, "Why was this guy so lucky to be loved by a rich girl?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If I could get a rich girl like that, I'd do anything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Richard, Melinda, Marcus, hurry up and get in the car. Nick's illness can't be delayed any longer," Allan said after he came back to his senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Allan opened the side sliding doors on both sides of the car as he walked up to the main driver's seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They got in their cars as Allan started the car and drove towards Solomia Hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus, you've married into such a rich family, so you know better doctors, right? Get Nick in touch with a doctor, or he won't live longer," Aria told Marcus in the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No sooner had Marcus said anything than Lisa got a bit impatient. "Mom, I've told you before that Allan has a lot of connections, and he knows a doctor in the cardiovascular department at Solomia Hospital, so we'll get him when the time comes. Marcus just got a nice marriage, but how could he possibly know a powerful doctor?"</span></p></div>
