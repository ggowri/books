  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam let out a scream, gritting his teeth in pain. He roared at Marcus, "How dare you treat me like this? Mr. Brooks will not let you get away with this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sneered, "You tried to attack me and thought you could leave unscathed. Do you really think that's possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam, enduring the intense pain, said, "Just wait here if you've got the guts. I'll have Mr. Brooks come and finish you off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Sam staggered to his feet, watching Marcus warily as he backed away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied with a cold laugh, "No need to fetch him. I'll come with you to visit the Axe Gang right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Daniel, who had been crippled, and the other dozen thugs were taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their gazes turned mocking as they looked at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this guy crazy? He actually wants to go back to the Axe Gang with us. He's asking for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, Mr. Brooks may treat everyone the same, but Sam is Mr. Brooks' nephew. With Mr. Brooks' temperament, he won't just stand by and do nothing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's for sure! And this guy even dares to barge into our Axe Gang. He's not getting out of there alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thugs whispered among themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having been in the underworld for years, it was the first time they had heard of someone who dared to walk into the lion's den after attacking a member of the Axe Gang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those were your words. Don't beg for mercy later!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam also burst into mocking laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lead the way," Marcus said indifferently, showing no sign of fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going too. I want to see this guy being tortured to death by Mr. Brooks!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they were about to leave, Daniel's voice came from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thugs immediately lifted Daniel and left the corridor together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus got into the gang's van. On the way, he messaged Josie, telling her not to worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than half an hour, the car stopped in front of a compound on the outskirts of the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The building was six stories high and looked extremely grand and imposing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The compound was as large as two soccer fields, with all kinds of facilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This must be the headquarters of the Axe Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is our Axe Gang's headquarters and also where you will die. Are you ready?" Sam asked Marcus with a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus ignored Sam and got out of the car directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Blake was in the courtyard, drinking and chatting with several association leaders, Baron among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were surrounded by sexy women, living it up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the van return, they looked over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam ran up and reported to Blake, "Mr. Brooks, a guy broke my arm and insisted on coming back with us, saying he wants to see you. Please don't spare him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake and the other association leaders immediately had strange expressions on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who is so arrogant as to dare to attack us and then walk into our lair?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake pushed aside the two big-breasted women next to him, stood up immediately, and emanated a murderous aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was strong and sturdy, with two axes hanging from his waist, exuding the aura of a warrior, possessing a strength that ordinary people couldn't match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was also the main reason why he could dominate the Kingston underworld and establish the Axe Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's the guy!" Sam pointed at Marcus, saying coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake, Baron, and the others looked over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Marcus was just a young man in his twenties, Blake revealed a disdainful smile and strode directly towards Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Baron recognized Marcus at a glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped forward and said to Blake, "Mr. Brooks, I know him. He is an old friend of my master. For the safety of our Axe Gang, please do not conflict with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Baron's words, Blake immediately frowned, "Your master? You mean Edgar from Serpent's Coil?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes." Baron nodded respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake said disdainfully, "What does his old friend have to do with me? He's your master, not mine. This guy has already offended the Axe Gang. If I don't teach him a lesson, how can I continue to hold my ground in the Kingston underworld?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
