        <h1>Chapter 322 The Top Dog</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The rest of the gangster all fiddled with their machetes and gathered around Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Theo was frightened. Marcus had gotten himself in deep shit and he wanted to let him go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus said, "Don't worry. They can't hurt me, and all of you don't have to pay protection fees in the future!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus stood there with his hands behind his back and refused to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Guys, take him down and tear him apart!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kim struggled to rise. Covered in injuries, he looked miserable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Consider it done!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The tattooed promised to come down on the spot, and at the same time, he came to Marcus. With a cold face, he said, "Punk, who the hell are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus said, "You are not qualified to talk to me. Tell your top dog to see me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as this remark came out, more than a dozen gangsters looked stunned, and then they laughed sarcastically. "Is this guy out of his mind? How dare he ask our head, Mr. Vito, to meet him? Doesn't he even take a look at himself in the mirror to see what he is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kid, if you want to see Mr. Vito, it's simple. Beat us first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The tattooed gangster said with a playful face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his view, even though Marcus had some skills and beat Kim, they had the advantage in numbers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And everyone was armed, while Marcus was bare-handed. How could he possibly stand a chance against them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The tattooed made moves on Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He chopped down directly at Marcus' head with a knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This knife was very powerful and fast, not giving Marcus any chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus casually dodged and delivered a clever hook.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The tattooed screamed as his chin was hit, and he was knocked out, wailing in pain!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Also, the rest of the gangsters attacked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' body was surrounded by knife strikes, each aimed at vital spots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The onlooking vendors were thrilled and shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They never imagined a young man, just here for a meal, would dare confront Black Tiger Gang that people they wouldn't even dare offend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They thought, "Facing the siege of so many gangsters, this young man is probably doomed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, before they could think further, several other gangsters were knocked down by Marcus' punches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, they heard continuous banging sounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under Marcus' fist, those gangsters couldn't withstand the attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In just ten seconds, a dozen gangsters were all knocked down and they screamed in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus picked up that tattooed gangster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The tattooed was terrified and instantly understood that this young man's strength was much greater than they had imagined!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had hit a tough opponent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Call your top dog to see me!" Marcus repeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The reason why he wanted to see their boss was to get information about the arms port.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The boss should know something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The tattooed didn't dare to disobey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He nodded repeatedly and readily agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus then threw the tattooed gangster to the ground without moving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Taking his people, the tattooed left in a hurry and went back to the Black Tiger Gang to find their boss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bravo! Good job!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the gangster left, a cheer erupted in the slum, and many people and vendors were excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These gangsters hung around here all year round, which brought many troubles to their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not only did they have to pay a high protection fee every week, but once they offended the gangsters, they would be beaten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For years, no one dared to intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Today, seeing Marcus beat those gangsters made them feel relieved!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bro, you should leave quickly. If Mr. Vito comes, you won't be able to leave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Theo reminded Marcus again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, at worst, we'll pay the protection fee, and they can't do anything about us. You go first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mary came over with her child in her arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus could see that Theo and Mary were kind people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the face of danger, they always advised him to leave. Marcus naturally wanted to help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before long, a noisy sound came from the other end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A dozen white Goldcup cars were coming this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many people gave way automatically, and someone with an unpleasant expression spoke up, "Tony Vito, the mafia boss, has come. Things are going south!"</span></p></div>
