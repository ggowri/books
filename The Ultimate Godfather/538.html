  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sync Group had invited a number of popular stars to perform, and Marcus was immediately drawn in by a familiar melody.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peering out of the car window, he spotted none other than Lila, singing on stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, please pull over," Marcus said decisively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car rolled to a stop at the curb, but the crowd was so dense that Marcus couldn't see much from where he stood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He approached a security guard, flashed his Sync Group's VIP card, and the guard's attitude immediately shifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a respectful nod, the guard led Marcus through a shortcut to the front of the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From his new vantage point, Marcus could see Lila clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clad in a graceful evening gown, she exuded elegance that was impossible to ignore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If not for the 21st century, Marcus would surely take Lila for an ancient beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her beauty was striking, but it was her voice, rich and perfectly suited for country ballads, that held the audience spellbound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' gaze wandered to a poster near the stage, which featured Lila prominently in the center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sync Group had also invited several other big-name celebrities, but Lila was undoubtedly the star of the show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't uncommon for companies like Sync Group, worth billions, to host extravagant events featuring top-tier talent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, something about tonight's lineup seemed different, likely a result of the new president's approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally, Marcus stayed out of the finer details, trusting his team to handle things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the stage, Lila caught sight of Marcus in the crowd. Her brows furrowed slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Him again? This guy's like a ghost. Won't stop haunting me!" she thought, her irritation rising.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She became even more convinced that Marcus had deliberately staged the earlier car accident as a way to approach her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Distracted by her thoughts, Lila nearly missed a note. Thankfully, her years of stage experience helped her recover quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The event was nearing its end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the headliner, Lila was scheduled to close out the show with three of her most iconic songs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as the first song ended, the host suddenly took the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next up, we have the sensational Tina Madison performing her song!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina has been a standout star since her debut, earning multiple awards and captivating fans across the country. Tonight, she's here as our grand finale act for Sync Group's 10th anniversary celebration. Let's give her a warm round of applause!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The announcement stunned the audience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the event, rumors had circulated that Lila would be the evening's final act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many in the audience had come specifically to see her perform, some traveling from faraway cities just to experience her live.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with this sudden change, confusion and frustration rippled through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Tina was popular, her fame simply didn't compare to Lila's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The audience began murmuring, and scattered boos broke out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila frowned and leaned to ask the host.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The host gave an apologetic shrug. "It's the organizer's decision, Ms. Sassoon. I'm just the messenger. Please don't take it personally."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suppressing her frustration, Lila stepped off the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she made her way backstage, her eyes landed on Marcus in the crowd again. She muttered under her breath, "What is your deal? Why are you following me? If you have something to say, just spit it out. There's no need to stage accidents or stalk me across the city."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus blinked, caught off guard. "You've got the wrong idea. I wasn't following you. I just heard your voice and stopped to take a look."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila crossed her arms, clearly unimpressed. "Don't bother. Everything you've done screams stalker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm in no mood to argue. If you want something, just call me. As long as it's reasonable, I'll consider it. But stop showing up everywhere I go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for a reply, she spun on her heel and walked off to the dressing room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Tina took the stage to perform her two finale songs. But by the time she reached the final number, nearly half the audience had left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that most attendees were Lila's fans, and her absence had taken the energy out of the event.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the performance ended, the organizer came onstage to hand out commemorative awards to the performers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was Edmund Cross, the balding middle-aged president of Stellar Entertainment, the media company running the event.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Cross, I was supposed to be the closing act. Why did you replace me with Tina at the last minute?" Lila approached and asked directly.</span></p><div class="pagination">
