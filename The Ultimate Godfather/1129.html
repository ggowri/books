  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Strands of terrifying coercion were released, instantly shrouding the area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately after, nine figures flew down from the sky and landed in Emotionless Gorge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Behind these nine figures was a large group of the Leah family's experts, all descending around the perimeter of Gertie's courtyard, exuding an intense sense of oppression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who dares to force their way into Emotionless Gorge?" an aged yet authoritative voice echoed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The speaker was Trevor. His voice seemed to transform into an invisible soundwave, resonating throughout Emotionless Gorge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some with lower cultivation felt their eardrums tingle, instinctively releasing their own power to resist the soundwaves, making themselves feel slightly better.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Minerva said angrily, "Grandmaster, it&rsquo;s him who tried to force his way into Emotionless Gorge and even used an artifact to injure me. Grandmaster, you must punish him severely."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, she only mentioned Marcus forcing his way into Emotionless Gorge and did not reveal that Gertie had already been defiled by Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps this was her way of protecting Gertie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, such matters concerned Gertie's reputation. Although Minerva deeply resented Marcus, she had to consider Gertie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Trevor glanced at Marcus indifferently, as if he didn&rsquo;t take him seriously at all. &ldquo;Do you know the consequences of forcing your way into the Leah Manor? I advise you to hand over that artifact immediately. Otherwise, I won&rsquo;t let you off.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Gertie stepped forward and said to Trevor, "Grandmaster, please calm down. Marcus is my boyfriend, and I brought him here. None of this is his fault. If you must punish someone, punish me instead."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing her words, the rest of the Leah family couldn't help but widen their eyes, their expressions turning grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Trevor said to Gertie, "The Leah family rules state that all family members' marriages must be approved by the senior members of the family. Did you get the family's consent to call him your boyfriend?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie bit her lip and shook her head, saying, "No. I made this decision on my own."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing her words, Trevor's face immediately darkened, and his voice turned icy. "Since you didn't get the family's approval, you've broken the family rules. I will not only deal with him but also punish you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, as a direct descendant of the Leah family, even if you want to marry, your spouse must come from a background comparable to your family's. This young man looks unfamiliar and doesn't seem to be from a prominent family."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since he's not from a prominent family, what qualifies him to be your boyfriend?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Trevor's words immediately gained the approval of the other members of the Leah family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Leah family has resided deep in the Kinton Mountains for many years and is a highly renowned Ancient Martial Art family in Uswad.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the world of Ancient Martial Art in Uswad, the Leah family holds an extremely high status. Naturally, they cannot tolerate someone as worthless as Marcus marrying a direct descendant of the Leah family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grandmaster, Marcus doesn't come from a big family, but he's a very strong individual. He's not as bad as you say he is. I consider it an honor for me to be his woman, "Gertie retorted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had never said these words to Marcus, but they were her true feelings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Apart from Marcus forcibly taking her, he excelled in every other aspect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Marcus's terrifying strength deeply convinced Gertie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;What nonsense are you talking about?&rdquo; Trevor said angrily after hearing Gertie's words, his tone icy. &ldquo;No matter what, you are a direct descendant of the Leah family and a standout among the younger generation of the Leah family. Yet you&rsquo;ve fallen for a worthless man. You&rsquo;re simply insulting yourself.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For a moment, the other members of the Leah family all criticized Gertie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They believed the Leah family held a noble status, and Gertie's actions were a disgrace to the Leah family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, a senior member of the Leah family couldn't help but say, "Grandmaster, stop wasting words with Gertie. I implore you to suppress this man and let him understand that the direct descendants of the Leah family are not for just anyone to claim."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Trevor immediately nodded, unleashing a terrifying burst of energy in an instant, then attempted to attack Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But before he could make a move, strange sounds echoed from the void.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, an incredibly terrifying coercion descended from the sky, making the entire space feel oppressive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately after, turbulent air currents surged in the sky, swiftly sweeping in from the distant horizon.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As everyone's gaze was drawn over, they saw a massive flying warship rapidly approaching.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Upon closer look, many people stood atop the flying warship, each radiating extremely powerful energy.</span></p><div class="pagination">
