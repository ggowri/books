  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm just telling you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kari's eyes were charming, and at the age of thirty-nine, she still exuded charm and grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that much of Melina's beauty had been inherited from her mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Kari's hand slipped beneath Davey's shirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Davey's eyes narrowed slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, it's been so long for us... I miss you," Kari whispered in his ear, her breath warm and inviting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Davey, trying to focus on his work, replied, "I still have a lot of documents to go through."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kari said, "You're always busy with work, leaving me on my own. I'm bored here. You really don't understand how to appreciate your wife."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she said this, Kari surprised him by slipping out of her clothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her extremely huge breasts bounced out and caught Davey's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kari, though nearing her forties and having given birth, maintained a remarkably youthful figure. Her chest, firm and well-proportioned, even surpassed her daughter's in fullness and grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could react, Kari leaned in and pressed her lips against Davey's, silencing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, her hand slid down to his waistband, gently caressing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't take long before Davey's emotions seemed to awaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned her over, pressing her onto the sofa, holding her face with both hands as he kissed her passionately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kari let out a moan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Women at this age often have a strong desire for intimacy and affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With just a gentle tease, her body was completely soft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Davey directly lifted up her skirt and gently caressed her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sudden sound echoed in the room. Kari let out a startled gasp, her body beginning to tremble uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hubby... after all these years, your size hasn't gotten smaller at all. It makes me feel so comfortable..." Kari said lovingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She spread her legs completely and let him go in and out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Davey's violent thrusting brought Kari to the climax.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Kari's mind, all she could envision were scenes of Marcus and her daughter together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The memory of the sounds she had overheard at the door earlier only made her feel even more stirred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body trembled even more intensely, completely beyond her control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Davey's eyes narrowed slightly, noticing that his wife had never acted this way before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What happened today?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't think much about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Kari in such a state completely stirred his own emotions, and he quickly found himself drawn into the moment as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shifted positions once again, approaching Kari with an intensity that was as fierce and relentless as a storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this period, he also took out the tools he bought online.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This completely brought her to the peak of passion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a final roar from Davey, the event came to an end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kari gasped for air, her voice weak as she said, "Honey, I am not in menopause yet. What if I get pregnant?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some reason, Davey had lasted much longer than usual this time, leaving him feeling invigorated and triumphant. He replied confidently, "If you get pregnant, we will just have another baby. What's the big deal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kari's face flushed even deeper. "At our age, having another baby would be so embarrassing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Davey chuckled, "You are only thirty-nine, and I am just forty-two. Why not? Look at older couples. They still maintain a healthy married life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kari gave him a pointed look. "Stop talking. If I hadn't initiated this, who knows how many months you'd go without touching me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sometimes I even suspect you have someone else outside!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Davey's expression turned apologetic. "That won't happen again. I promise to fully meet your needs from now on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a playful glint in her eye, Kari teased, "Then tell me, what if Melina gets pregnant?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Davey paused for a moment, then laughed, "Even better! You and our daughter can be pregnant together. You could look after each other, and the uncle and nephew could grow up to be great friends!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kari immediately covered his mouth, her face burning with embarrassment. "Stop talking nonsense! At our age, aren't you ashamed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was thinking, if she gets pregnant, I will take care of the child for her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other side, Marcus also brought things to an end after an intense effort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he managed to bring Melina to unparalleled moments of joy multiple times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina lay on the bed completely exhausted, her body limp as if all her strength had left her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina, still catching her breath and immersed in a lingering sense of happiness, asked weakly, "Marcus, why did it feel so much more intense this time? It even hurts a little..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled and replied, "Didn't you like me being more intense?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everything is best in moderation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blushing deeply, her face was glowing with a rosy hue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then why were you encouraging me earlier? Were you not serious?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus... stop it! You're going to embarrass me to death! I am worried Sarah might have overheard!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
