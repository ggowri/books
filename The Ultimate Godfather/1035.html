        <h1>Chapter 942 Dirty Deals-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe's expression hardened as she eyed the security guards closing in. Her voice was sharp, cutting through the tension like a blade. "Miles, everyone in this room knows exactly what kind of man you are. Do I really need to spell it out? You're not even trying to justify yourself&mdash;you're just using your position to shut me up. That's what this is, isn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miles let out a slow, amused chuckle. "And what if I am? I am using my power to shut you down. What are you gonna do about it? This is my industry. Royal Entertainment belongs to me. And you? You're just an actress who doesn't know her place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get her out of here." His voice dropped, lethal. "And make sure every company we work with cancels her contracts. As of tonight, Chloe is finished."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards moved in, ready to drag her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd collectively sucked in a breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had assumed Miles would handle this quietly, backroom deals and blacklists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But doing this in public? He wasn't even pretending to play fair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was an outright confession&mdash;proof that the award was rigged, that his affair with Selena was real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then again, Miles wasn't just any executive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He ran Royal Entertainment like his own empire, and no one dared challenge him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with the biggest names in the industry present, not a single person was willing to step in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the scariest part? Even if someone recorded this, no one would have the guts to post it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, once Royal Entertainment terminated Chloe's contract, no other company would dare sign her. Her career wouldn't just take a hit&mdash;it would be over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the power of money and influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If one had enough of both, he could rewrite reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't matter if one were in the wrong&mdash;the world would still see him as right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because when one controlled the game, he controlled the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Miles spoke, the security team cracked their knuckles, ready to make their move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before the guards could make a move, Marcus' voice cut through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room stiffened. Every eye turned to him, expressions flickering with surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What is he trying to do? Is he actually planning to play the hero?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miles' head tilted slightly as he studied Marcus, irritation flickering in his eyes. "You got something to say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't hesitate. "You're the executive vice president of Royal Entertainment, and yet all you've done is exploit your position. Bribery, dirty deals, manipulating the awards&mdash;hell, even screwing your own artists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're dragging Royal Entertainment's name through the mud. What I don't get is&mdash;who the hell gave a low-level executive like you the guts to think you could get away with this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A stunned silence fell over the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nobody had expected this&mdash;some random young man openly calling out Miles in front of the entire industry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The way he spoke, the authority in his voice&mdash;it wasn't a desperate plea or a reckless outburst. It sounded like a warning. Like a boss reprimanding an employee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could figure out what had gotten into this guy.</span><br><span>Who does he think he is, talking to Miles like that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miles' amusement flickered into something darker. And then, he laughed, "Who the hell do you think you are? You really think you can stand there and talk to me like that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if I am pulling strings, even if I am getting exactly what I want&mdash;who's gonna stop me? You? What, you think you're some big shot at Royal Entertainment? News flash, kid&mdash;you're nothing."</span></p></div>
