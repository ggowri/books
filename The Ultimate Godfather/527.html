"But since you dared to try and take my life, don't blame me for being ruthless." With that, Marcus twisted Isaac's wrist with a swift motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sickening sound of bones snapping rang out as Isaac's wrist was broken. The jagged bone pierced through his skin, leaving a gruesome sight that made everyone shudder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" Isaac let out a bloodcurdling scream. Despite his years of Karate training and extensive combat experience, witnessing his own wrist being broken left him paralyzed with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You lowly Uswadian scum!" Isaac snarled through gritted teeth. "You dare break my arm? The Griffin family won't let you get away with this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smirked disdainfully. "The Griffin family, huh? If they come for me, I don't mind wiping out your entire family from Crankhurst."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though his words exuded dominance, the crowd couldn't help but dismiss them as empty bravado. The Griffin family was a renowned powerhouse in Crankhurst&mdash;no mere threat could topple them. But Marcus wasn't done yet. With a swift motion, he broke Isaac's other wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac nearly passed out from the searing pain. His forehead was drenched in a cold sweat. Two more kicks followed, shattering both of Isaac's knees. He was completely crippled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd collectively gasped, horrified at Marcus' brutal actions. No one had expected him to go this far. Crippling Isaac in front of everyone was tantamount to declaring war on the Griffin family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac roared, and his voice trembled with rage, "You'll regret this! My family won't let you off the hook!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled coldly, "You tried to kill me, and I spared your life. Consider yourself lucky."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The commotion quickly drew the attention of Kingston University's security department. A large group of guards approached, led by Luke Bennett, the head of security&mdash;a man in his forties whom every student at Kingston recognized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luke's face darkened as his eyes fell on the injured Isaac and Patrick sprawled on the ground. Turning to Marcus, he demanded, "Did you do this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you have any idea who they are? You've attacked them at Kingston University. Are you courting death?" Luke snarled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac, a direct descendant of the Griffin family from Crankhurst, had been sent to Uswad as an exchange student under the foreign ministry's sponsorship. This incident was a diplomatic nightmare waiting to explode.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their identities mean nothing to me," Marcus replied calmly. "All I know is they messed with me, and they paid the price."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luke let out a mocking laugh, shaking his head in disbelief at Marcus' audacity. "You really don't know fear, do you?" He waved his hand, signaling the guards to surround Marcus. "Arrest him and hand him over to the authorities."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards encircled Marcus, wielding batons, ready to leave him no chance of escape. Marcus glanced at them and sneered, "Do you even bother to investigate who's at fault before making arrests?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luke's tone was firm. "Both Isaac and Patrick come from prominent families. They've been raised with the best education and discipline. It's obvious that a lowly person like you provoked them. Who else would I arrest?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes turned icy as he pointed to the surveillance cameras. "Check the footage."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luke shook his head dismissively. "I trust my own eyes. There's no need for that. Given what you've done, you'll likely spend the rest of your life behind bars." As he spoke, Luke gestured for his guards to close in. Holding batons tightly, they advanced, determined to subdue Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, what should we do?" Natalia's voice trembled with panic. She knew all too well how ruthless the university's security team could be. Though they were merely the campus security team, their ruthlessness surpassed that of most enforcers when it came to dealing with troublemakers or intruders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once, a robber attempted to commit a theft on campus. When caught by the security team, they mercilessly broke both his arms and legs before handing him over to the police. The verdict? The security team was deemed blameless. After all, Kingston University was Uswad's top-tier institution. Even the police tended to side with the university in such matters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave her a reassuring glance. He had no intention of causing trouble, but since these people insisted on escalating the situation, he saw no reason to back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the guards moved in to restrain him, Marcus struck. The sound of fists and bodies colliding filled the air. One by one, the guards let out pained cries as they were knocked to the ground. In less than two minutes, all ten guards lay sprawled on the floor, groaning in agony.</span></p><div class="pagination">
