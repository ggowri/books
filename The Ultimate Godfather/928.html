        <h1>Chapter 879 Strong Enemies Are Coming!</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In short, Marcus was now more confident in his own strength than before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Almost at the same time, there were waves of terrifying auras in the air, quickly covering the room where Marcus was.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made Marcus frown slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could feel that these auras definitely came from Return Essence stage experts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone's aura was extremely powerful, and all of them were Demon Fighter cultivation!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They came in such a crushing way, obviously with bad intentions, and were coming for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus said to Cecilia, "Cecilia, I have something to do. I'm not sure if I can come back today. Don't worry about me. I'll be fine."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecilia blinked her narrow eyes, nodded gently, and said, "Mr. Fitzgerald, if you have something to do, go ahead. Don't worry about me. I'll wait for your good news here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecilia could see that Marcus really had something to do. After all, she was a girl with very high emotional intelligence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus must have his reasons for not saying what he was going to do.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecilia would not ask any more questions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew that people like Marcus were the ones who really made big things happen. It was normal that some things were not convenient to mention to others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Okay."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus nodded lightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then he walked out of the room and jumped.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Taking advantage of the cover of the night, he flew away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now his cultivation had successfully reached the Return Essence stage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the help of Numinous Energy, he could fly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And his flying speed was really high, almost equivalent to the speed of a car running at full speed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon he left the McHale family area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The McHale family was not in the prosperous area of the city.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Behind it were endless mountains.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The mountains were thousands of miles long and towering into the clouds.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were many unknown, mysterious areas in the mountains.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus flew directly into the depths of the mountains.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, he chose a valley to land.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During his flight, the spiritual senses actually tracked his trajectory throughout the whole process.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was enough to show that they were coming for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't care about that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instead, he found an area to sit cross-legged and began to enter the state of cultivation, waiting for their arrival.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long after, three figures showed up, floating above the valley.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These three figures were two men and one woman, all of whom were Demon Fighters. The two men were wearing wizard cloaks and looked over 40.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, they must have lived through samsara.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The leading woman was Alison, who had fought with Marcus before!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alison wore an ultra-short, shiny black leather skirt, which highlighted her perfect figure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her outfit matched her angelic face and smooth skin, giving people a strong visual impact!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Alison coming with two men, Marcus sneered. He slowly stood up from the boulder and said, "You are really like a sticker that can't be shaken off."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alison floated in the air, overlooking Marcus. Her eyes were sharp, revealing the majesty of a superior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said in an arrogant tone, "I didn't expect you to dare to come to </span><span>Acoton</span><span>. You are asking for death."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus glanced at Alison sarcastically and said with a mocking face, "Oh, I understand what you mean. If I didn't come to </span><span>Acoton</span><span>, you wouldn't dare to do anything to me. Because you are afraid of Diana, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His simple words immediately aroused Alison's anger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alison's face was gloomy. Her eyes looked like they could kill.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had always regarded Diana as a competitor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So</span><span> she naturally couldn't accept the fact that Diana's strength was stronger than hers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Marcus directly stated this fact, which was tantamount to hurting Alison's self-esteem!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You are so sharp-tongued. I don't want to waste time talking to you. Today is the day you die. Die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She winked at a man beside her while she spoke.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man immediately sneered and stepped forward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His body floated directly above Marcus' head. He said coldly, "Boy, I really don't know where you get the courage from. You dare to be so arrogant to Ms. Krauss when you are about to die? I'll give you a chance to reduce the pain of your death. Commit suicide. Otherwise, you will be tortured to death. There is no need for this, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus just glanced at him. The irony in his eyes became more and more obvious. He said, "Don't talk nonsense with me here. If you have the ability, show me your strength. Otherwise, fuck off immediately. I don't have time to waste with you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as these words came out, that man's face immediately became gloomy. He gritted his teeth and said, "You chose your own path. You can't blame others. I will torture you to death!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, a powerful magical force was released from his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A series of purple-black lightnings swirled around him. The wind was blowing hard in the air, making his black cloak rustle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was Demon Fighter's Stage Two cultivation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With this kind of strength, he had almost no rivals in this world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He raised his hand, and an extremely thick purple-black lightning descended from the sky. Wherever it passed, everything seemed to be destroyed!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the lightning reached Marcus' head.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus dodged the lightning with a casual move.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was a loud bang.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The terrifying lightning descended, splitting a huge pit in the ground and cracking all around!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Marcus dodged his attack, that man's eyes condensed slightly. He didn't expect Marcus to be so fast.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Prins, don't waste time with him. Just kill him in one move!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Marcus dodge the attack, Alison thought Prins was intentionally going easy on Marcus, so she immediately reminded him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Prins' expression became slightly unpleasant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only he knew that he hadn't gone easy on Marcus at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was Marcus who dodged the attack himself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, since Alison said so, he couldn't say anything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could only nod to Alison and said, "Ms. Krauss, don't worry. I will kill this guy right away!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While speaking, Prins descended from the air.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he waved his arms, and bursts of purple-black thunder flashed in his palms.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then it wove into an extremely terrifying thunder net, shrouding Marcus at an extremely fast speed!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the net, the terrifying thunder power kept flashing, containing the power to destroy everything!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' expression was still very calm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Facing this terrifying net, he did not hesitate to blast a terrifying Fist Ray into the void.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His Fist Ray collided with the thunder net at a very fast speed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With an extremely strong explosion sound, the thunder net exploded directly and turned into powder!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the net was shattered, Prins was also affected.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His body trembled, and he couldn't help but spit out a mouthful of blood. His face turned pale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus took a step forward quickly and blasted a terrifying Fist Ray at Prins again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The power of this fist seemed to be more terrifying than before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before the Fist Ray came, Prins felt a destructive force wrapped around his body, causing him to tremble involuntarily and subconsciously raise his hand to resist.</span></p></div>
