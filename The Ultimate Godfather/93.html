  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to possess it?" Marcus addressed Jalen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jalen nodded eagerly, like a chicken pecking at grain. "Please, Mr. Fitzgerald, teach me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus reached into his Spatial Ring and retrieved the Magic Codex, handing it to Jalen. "You have one week," he commanded, "to memorize this book cover to cover, understand its every meaning, and master at least two spells. I will return in a week to test your progress. If you fail, you will face the consequences."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jalen accepted the Magic Codex, his face set with determination. "Don't worry, Mr. Fitzgerald, I will complete the task!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Serpent's Coil leaders watched with envy as Jalen received this personal instruction from Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The memory of Marcus's solo assault on their headquarters was still fresh in their minds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who wouldn't crave that god-like power?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, sensing their thoughts, addressed them in a clear voice. "Don't be impatient. As long as you follow my commands wholeheartedly, I won't forget you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once Jalen has mastered this Magic Codex, I will have him teach its secrets to every member of the Serpent's Coil. With dedication and practice, you will all become powerful Wizards!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's words were a reassurance, igniting excitement among the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus hadn't forgotten them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By faithfully following him, they, too, could become formidable sorcerers, capable of soaring through the skies and wielding incredible magic!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Serpent's Coil members were thrilled by the prospect of their future power, their respect for Marcus growing even more profound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Teaching the Serpent's Coil witchcraft was the first step in Marcus building his forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they had mastered the basics, he would instruct them in the ways of Fireball and Lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a legion of Wizards at his command, he would be ready to face his two unknown brothers without fear!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving Serpent's Coil, Marcus went to visit his adoptive parents at Cedars Villas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being the weekend, Nicole was also at home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, dear," Melinda said, "your cousin's getting married back in our hometown, but we couldn't get train tickets. Would you mind driving us there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the countryside was quite a distance away, Marcus couldn't bring himself to refuse. It was the first time his adoptive parents had ever asked him for a favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour later, Marcus was behind the wheel of his Elfa luxury van with Richard's family all aboard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cruising down the highway, they reached Yolanda Village, Melinda's hometown, two hours later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Yolanda Village fell under Solomia's jurisdiction, it was pretty much in the middle of nowhere, seriously lagging in development.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The village roads were a mess of potholes and mud, and most villagers still lived in houses built decades ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The appearance of such a luxury van in the village turned quite a few heads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That van's a real beauty, way bigger than the village chief's son's. Must be worth at least eighty thousand dollars. City folks, for sure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, it's quite something. I heard it's Melinda's family coming back for Jessica's wedding."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ain't Melinda the one who married into the next village over? She's been struggling all these years - how'd they end up with such a fancy van?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The village gossips huddled together, chattering away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some kid was the first to run to Louise's house with the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing the news, Marcus's grandfather, Samuel Lewis, aunt Louise Reed, second aunt Christine Lewis, and cousin Jessica Reed all rushed to the doorway to welcome them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the Alpha minivan approaching, Louise looked surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Has Melinda's family struck it rich? How can they afford such a nice car?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Christine was also taken aback, then quickly put on an ingratiating smile. "What good is a nice car? Your Jessica has found a good husband. You're going to live the good life, Louise!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Christine's flattery made Louise feel a bit smug, and she deliberately lifted her chin with pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike the others, Jessica, who had worked in Solomia for many years, recognized Alpha. With a hint of disdain, she said, "That's an Alpha. It costs over a million."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Louise and Christine were shocked. "What? A minivan costs over a million? It seems Melinda's family really has made it big!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jessica sneered. "Aunt Melinda's family could never afford this kind of minivan. They're farmers! They barely scrape by. Whoever's driving that is probably just a chauffeur!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
