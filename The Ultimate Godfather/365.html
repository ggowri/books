        <h1>Chapter 364 Dredge Energy Channels</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have three blocked energy channels in your body that are blocked, so if you want to learn Ancient Martial Art, you will need to unblock them first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The first one is located at the breasts, the second at the lower abdomen, and the third in the perineal area. Today, we will start by unblocking the one at the breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The other two energy channels will be unblocked one every other day, over a total of three days. After that, you will be able to start learning secret techniques of Ancient Martial Art."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Marcus had already activated the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, with streams of Numinous Energy surging in his palms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, he slowly placed his palms on Grace's smooth and firm breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Grace's body froze in place as a surge of electricity coursed through her, causing her to involuntarily let out a gasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, it is so embarrassing..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the moment she was touched by Marcus, she unexpectedly shed a single tear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace was a very traditional girl, and until now, she had always thought that her first time should be given to her future husband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, now, although Marcus was clearing her energy channel, not only was her body exposed, but he had also touched her breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This left Grace feeling deeply conflicted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the complexity in her heart was replaced by a powerful surge of heat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That surge of heat quickly traveled from Marcus' palm to the surface of Grace's breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace felt an intense itch on her breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A powerful surge of electricity erupted from her breasts, quickly spreading throughout her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body could not help but tremble, and before long, the itching sensation was replaced by an overwhelming sense of comfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the first time she experienced such a strange sensation. She could not help but close her eyes, letting out a soft, faint moan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the heat intensified, the feeling of comfort for Grace grew even stronger, adding a sense of urgency she had not felt before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She found herself unexpectedly craving something, her mind filling with indescribable images.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Certain parts of the body began to twitch involuntarily, as if a sense of emptiness was spreading, quickly enveloping the entire body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made her breathe harder, her small hands gripping Marcus' arm, her body moving uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah...Mr. Fitzgerald, what are you doing to me? I feel so uncomfortable..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace could not help but ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This impulse was something she had never felt before, and images of being with Marcus in an intimate embrace unexpectedly flashed through her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am clearing your energy channel. The process might be slow, so just bear with it for a bit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus fully activated the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire. Seeing Grace's enticing expression, a heat stirred within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he knew he could not take advantage of her vulnerability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pushed aside his distractions and focused entirely on clearing her energy channel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, since the vein was connected to a sensitive area of a woman's body, the flow of Numinous Energy inevitably triggered a certain impulse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For someone like Grace, an innocent young woman, it was truly a test.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald...I feel so uncomfortable...I want you to help me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace completely lost control and threw herself into Marcus' arms, her lips pressing against his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, Marcus almost lost control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he forced himself to push Grace away. He thought, "This is a crucial moment for clearing her energy channel, and any interruption will undo all my efforts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had no choice but fully channel the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire. A stronger surge of Timeless Numinous Energy flowed from his palm into Grace's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace felt an overwhelming wave of pleasure, causing her to lose consciousness for a moment, her mind going blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strong sensation in her body made her unable to control a high-pitched cry, her body almost giving way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, you have made me feel so good, I really want you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace gave a seductive cry uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she reached the peak of her experience for the first time, Marcus finally broke through the blocked energy channel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huff!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus withdrew his hands from her breasts, letting out a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Marcus withdrew his hands, the intense feeling of pleasure within Grace also faded away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could not help but feel a strange sense of loss in her heart. "Mr. Fitzgerald...is the treatment over?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mm."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded, "How do you feel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace's face turned crimson as she quickly grabbed a towel from nearby, covering her alluring figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I feel great...but it is so embarrassing...and...I think I said a lot of shameful things earlier...Mr. Fitzgerald, will you laugh at me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace lowered her head, glancing at Marcus' expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled, "How could I? Your energy channel is in a sensitive area, so it is normal to have such a reaction. After all, we are human, with emotions and desires."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace nodded obediently and asked, "The next session is the day after tomorrow, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I have an arrest operation tomorrow, but I should be able to do the treatment the day after."</span></p></div>
