        <h1>Chapter 989 Forcibly Setting Up a Cave Mansion-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus</span><span>'s fist, like a death warrant, slammed fiercely onto his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Blasting his body into pieces, turning it into shattered flesh scattered all over the ground!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This scene made the faces of the other </span><span>Ophidians</span><span> involuntarily show a trace of horror.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one expected the young man's strength to be so terrifying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Titan Python Snake Man said to his companions, "This guy seems ready to fight us to the death. Be careful, everyone. Attack him together and wipe him out completely!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>T</span><span>he other </span><span>Ophidians</span><span> nodded one after another, then collectively unleashed their aura and launched a terrifying attack toward </span><span>Marcus</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their cultivation was actually above the </span><span>Acquired State</span><span>, and each </span><span>could even punch above their weight class</span><span>. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Combined, the strength of dozens of them was not to be underestimated!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But they were up against </span><span>Marcus</span><span>, this freak, so it </span><span>was</span><span> their bad luck.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, they began unleashing terrifying attacks on </span><span>Marcus</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Within the cave, various destructive forces erupted, enveloping </span><span>Marcus</span><span>'s figure from all directions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie</span><span> watched with her heart pounding in fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her cultivation had only reached Ancient Martial Stage Nine, with a chasm still to cross before reaching the </span><span>Acquired State</span><span> realm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, she was not qualified to partake in battles exclusive to </span><span>Acquired State</span><span> realm experts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Any one of these </span><span>Ophidians</span><span> could easily kill her in an instant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, </span><span>Gertie</span><span> could only watch from a distance and pray in her heart that </span><span>Marcus</span><span> would be safe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Almost at the same time, one of the black mamba </span><span>Ophidian</span><span>'s attacks swiftly descended in front of </span><span>Marcus</span><span>. He was</span><span> surrounded by black mist, eerie and terrifying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus</span><span> neither dodged nor avoided, delivering a sweeping kick that instantly broke through everything and struck the black mamba </span><span>Ophidian</span><span>'s head.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a dull thud, the </span><span>creature</span><span> didn't even have time to scream before its head was directly kicked apart by </span><span>Marcus</span><span>, leaving behind a headless corpse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Almost at the same time, a rattlesnake </span><span>Ophidian</span><span> appeared behind </span><span>Marcus</span><span>, holding a crimson dagger in his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The dagger emitted a pungent smell, likely coated with some extremely potent venom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before the words had faded, the rattlesnake </span><span>Ophidian</span><span> raised the dagger and stabbed directly toward </span><span>Marcus</span><span>'s back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This attack was not only extremely swift but also quite abrupt.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it were someone else, they might not even have time to react before being gutted by the opponent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, </span><span>Marcus</span><span> was no ordinary person.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While fighting, he also unleashed all his spiritual power</span><span>s</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, he completely enveloped the space, and nothing within it escaped his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everything was</span><span> under his control.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before the opponent's dagger could strike, </span><span>Marcus</span><span> swung a punch backward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The </span><span>Fist Ray</span><span> pierced through the heavens and descended.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next moment, a thunderous explosion sounded as the rattlesnake </span><span>Ophidian</span><span>'s upper body was blasted to pieces, dead beyond doubt!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, more and more attacks descended, each with unimaginably immense power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Especially seeing their companions continuously die at </span><span>Marcus</span><span>'s hands, these </span><span>Ophidians</span><span> grew even angrier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They almost unleashed all their potential, something others might truly be unable to withstand!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, </span><span>Marcus</span><span> didn't care at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Facing these attacks, he swiftly activated the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Strands of Timeless Numinous Energy swirled around him, accompanied by the release of Thunderfire Power</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Three </span><span>Ophidians</span><span> launched attacks at him together, but </span><span>Marcus</span><span> casually waved his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his palm, terrifying Thunderfire Power</span><span> bloomed together with </span><span>Timeless Numinous Energy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It transformed into an overwhelming force of destruction descending.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Terrifying explosions echoed continuously as the two forces clashed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The unleashed power was earth-shatteringly strong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three </span><span>Ophidians</span><span> thought joining forces would be enough to rival </span><span>Marcus</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, when the attacks truly collided, they realized just how naive they had been.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus</span><span>'s attack was unstoppable, far beyond what the three of them could withstand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the Thunderfire Power engulfed their bodies and completely destroyed them!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>Die!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Almost at the same time, the Titan Python </span><span>Ophidian</span><span>'s attack arrived.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was the strongest among the</span><span>m</span><span>, with cultivation reaching the peak of Acquired State Three.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, he possessed terrifying </span><span>power</span><span> and the power of this attack was at least equivalent to </span><span>that from a human at Ancient Martial Stage Five</span><span>!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, even though the strength of this </span><span>Ophidian</span><span> was beyond ordinary</span><span>, </span><span>in front of </span><span>Marcus</span><span>, it was still not enough. The terrifying Thunderfire Hand Strike slammed wildly toward the opponent's position.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In just the blink of an eye, it collided with the opponent's attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone only heard an astonishing explosion sound.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under </span><span>Marcus</span><span>'s Thunderfire Hand Strike, the Titan </span><span>Ophidian</span><span>'s attack was like paper, instantly shattered and destroyed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus</span><span>'s Thunderfire Hand Strike was extremely domineering, fiercely landing on his body!</span></p></div>
