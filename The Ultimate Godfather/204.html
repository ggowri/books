  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew's reliance on a wheelchair wasn't due to a recent accident or injury but because of his frailty from aging. His muscles had weakened, his blood circulation was poor, and his organs were deteriorating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the conversation among the crowd was unfolding, Marcus had already used his X-ray vision to assess Matthew's physical condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the help of this pill, Matthew's issues could be alleviated quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though it wouldn't grant him immortality, it would at least extend his life by several years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the pill appeared ordinary, no different from a regular small tablet. To the onlookers, it seemed unimpressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing the pill, many of them froze for a moment before their faces contorted into mocking smiles. Some even laughed out loud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought Marcus was trying to pass off this tiny pill as a gift, clearly unable to come up with anything more meaningful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does he think the Burnett family is filled with idiots?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What could this tiny pill possibly do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's just trying to fool people!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this guy some kind of street scammer? How could a pill like that have any real effect? Ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd murmured, some nodding in agreement with the words being said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaun, Malcolm, Ruth, and Arnold all wore expressions of blatant mockery, their eyes filled with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maxine, is this really the man you want to marry? As someone said earlier, no pill can do what he claims. He's just overestimating himself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm couldn't hold back his ridicule.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maxine, I've watched you grow up, and I truly want you to have a happy future. But this man, from the start, I've never liked him. It's not just because of his background; he looks more like a con artist!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone like him has nothing to compare to Mr. Whitman. You should make him leave and accept Mr. Whitman's proposal. It's the best choice for you," Ruth said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen, Hazel, and Stella were too embarrassed to lift their heads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had assumed that although Maxine's choice might not match Shaun's status, at least the man she was interested in would be a respectable, accomplished individual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, to their shock, he was presenting a cheap pill as a gift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a gathering of more than 80% of Kingston's elite, after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had just lost face in front of all these influential people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maxine, who exactly is this man you've chosen? He looks like a con artist. You didn't get swindled, did you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella approached Maxine, lowering her voice to warn her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine, who had seen Marcus' medical skills firsthand, trusted him deeply when it came to his knowledge of healing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she had only seen Marcus instruct Robert on performing surgery on Edward. She didn't know he also had a gift for concocting medicines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, as everyone pointed out, this small pill did look rather unremarkable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine also found herself doubting, caught between belief and skepticism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Young man, are you seriously offering this pill as my gift?" Matthew asked, his voice full of disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave a calm nod. "Sir Burnett, don't be fooled by its appearance. This pill will be of great use to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop this nonsense. What could an ordinary pill possibly do? Don't tell me it's going to cure my father's old age ailments!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm sneered, his voice dripping with sarcasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew had consulted many renowned doctors over the years and even spent time overseas for treatment, but nothing had worked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he grew older, his condition worsened. Since last year, he had been unable to move </span><span>without a wheelchair, struggling even to stand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> Malcolm was merely speaking out of habit. To him, the idea of a simple pill solving such a complex issue seemed utterly absurd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir Burnett's illness is primarily due to aging, with organ deterioration, insufficient blood flow, and weakness in his bones. This pill is specifically designed to treat common ailments of the elderly," Marcus explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then turned his gaze toward Matthew. "Sir Burnett, have you noticed a dull pain in your right ribcage, especially during the full moon? Does your left knee ever feel numb, sore, or swollen, only easing after a few strong taps on the back? And do you often wake up in the middle of the night due to pain?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus spoke, many people's sarcastic expressions only deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were convinced he was just spouting nonsense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop pretending to be a grand doctor. My grandfather has been to countless foreign hospitals for treatment with no effect. Do you really think you can cure him just by talking?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arnold finally couldn't hold back, angrily confronting Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt his cousin had clearly chosen a fool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly, Arnold. Don't listen to him. I've met plenty of people like him, posing as a doctor and swindling money, especially from wealthy families like ours!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm scoffed dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's right. Everything he said was spot on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as the crowd continued to mock Marcus, a voice of shock suddenly came from Matthew himself...</span></p><div class="pagination">
