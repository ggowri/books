  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie looked at Marcus' chiseled face, and a look of admiration appeared on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I came here to apologize," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus blinked in slight surprise and responded, "There's absolutely no need for that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why?" Natalie asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because I never thought much of you from the start. You don't need to apologize to me," Marcus smiled and replied nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie immediately pouted, her expression losing the pride and disdain it had before. Instead, a hint of timidness mixed with some grievance appeared on her face. "When we were in school, you'd never have said that. You've changed. Do all men become so fickle like you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus shook his head helplessly. "If you don't have anything important to say, then you should leave. I'm heading home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Marcus' obvious dismissal, Natalie wasn't angry. She continued on her own, "Marcus, I was your dream lover back then. You pursued me for years when we were in school, but I never agreed to be with you. I don't believe you don't like me at all now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I'm right here in front of you. Do whatever you want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Natalie slowly reached out and grasped Marcus' hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Marcus immediately pulled his hand away, his face full of disdain. "Stop fooling yourself. I'm not interested in you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing his words, Natalie felt a sudden pang of hurt. Her beautiful eyes even glistened slightly with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, a stubborn look appeared on her delicate face. "I don't believe it. I don't believe you don't like me at all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Natalie suddenly got up from the passenger seat and quickly pulled down Marcus' pants. She opened her mouth and kissed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though this series of actions seemed complicated, it actually happened in less than two seconds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie's movements were fluid as if she had been professionally trained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Marcus, although he thought she was a bit foolish, she had once been the dream lover of his school days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Combined with her unexpected actions, it caught him completely off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh..." Marcus couldn't help but inhale sharply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bitch... are you crazy? Get up now!" he shouted angrily at Natalie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie looked up, her delicate face slightly flushed, a victorious expression appearing on her features. "Yes, you're right. I'm crazy. As long as you're satisfied, you can call me whatever you want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once she finished speaking, Natalie began to move again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus immediately felt a strong, tingling sensation, as if his body had been jolted by an electric shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was the specific environment and the person in front of him, but Marcus found himself suddenly unable to resist, his will weakening in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only surrender, letting Natalie take control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie sucked it and hummed softly, the sound was extremely seductive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Speaking purely in terms of appearance, Natalie fit Marcus' aesthetic </span><span>taste </span><span>perfectly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, he wouldn't have been so completely captivated by her back in school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did Natalie have an impressive figure, but her skin was also flawless and fair. Her features were delicate and refined, the kind that seemed effortlessly charming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Combined with her elegant aura, she gave off an alluring yet innocent vibe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially when she smiled, she was utterly enchanting, a vision of grace and beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, as he watched her movements, memories from their school days suddenly resurfaced in Marcus' mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flood of emotions caused his feelings to swell, growing stronger with each passing second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for Natalie to continue, his big hands directly grasped her slender waist and forcibly dragged her to the driver's seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie let out a surprised sound, clearly not expecting Marcus to suddenly make such a bold move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could even speak, she felt Marcus' lips press against her own, effectively silencing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The electric shock of the moment caused heat to spread through Natalie, stirring her emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie, despite her ambition and love for money, was also someone who admired power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' actions had completely won her over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cold, dismissive attitude she once held towards him had vanished. All that remained now was admiration and even a touch of reverence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This only fueled Natalie's desire for Marcus even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus just kissed her casually, and Natalie couldn't bear it anymore. She gasped, and her desire for Marcus grew even stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, do you want me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie shot Marcus a sultry glance, her eyes filled with anticipation for what was about to unfold between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, clearly affected by her provocative gaze, was nearly overwhelmed with desire. Unable to hold back, he turned to Natalie and said, "You need to think this through. Even if I go through with it, I won't take any responsibility."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Natalie nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, although they were in the hotel parking lot, Marcus had parked in a rather secluded spot. The darkness of the night further hid them from view, ensuring that no one noticed what was going on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For added security, Marcus quickly unleashed a wave of spiritual powers, enveloping the space around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt as though the car's interior was completely isolated from the outside world.</span></p><div class="pagination">
