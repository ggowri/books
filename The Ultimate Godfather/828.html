  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could this be? How is this possible? Why is this happening? What on earth is going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara's eyes were filled with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly remembered what Marcus had said earlier, that with just a phone call, he could make Ronan lose everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought to herself, "Could it be that this guy is behind all of this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The saleswoman, Selina Zaki's face turned pale with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sudden turn of events had caught her off guard, and she had also lost a major deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her commission of 100 thousand had gone down the drain!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, do you believe me?" Marcus looked at Ronan with a mocking expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronan trembled and asked, "Who are you? Who are you really, and how do you have such immense power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sneered and said, "Who I am doesn't matter. What matters is that one of you, the father, is guilty of embezzlement and bribery, while the other, the son, has been flaunting and squandering the ill-gotten wealth. This is the real reason you two have ended up like this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard! Just wait! I'll call my dad right now and have him come over to deal with you. You've made us lose everything! My dad will definitely make you pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronan's gaze turned ferocious upon hearing Marcus' words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that Marcus was behind all of this, and his hatred for him had reached its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Ronan immediately took out his phone and dialed Kristen's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He went on to explain everything that had happened at the 4S shop in detail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kristen's rage flared instantly as he realized he had been set up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swore that since Marcus had taken everything from him, he would make Marcus pay a hundred times over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up, Ronan coldly glared at Marcus and said through gritted teeth, "My dad will be back soon. You'd better stay right here and wait. When he arrives, I'll make sure he breaks your limbs and shows you what happens when you try to make me lose everything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronan's voice was filled with hysteria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara shot a cold look at Marcus and Natalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Ronan had lost everything, that meant she had lost everything as well, and she, too, hated Marcus and Natalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was eager to see them suffer and wanted to witness their miserable downfall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia looked at Marcus with some concern and asked, "Marcus, these two are like mad dogs. Shouldn't we leave? Even if they can't do anything to you, this situation could still affect our mood."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After everything that had happened, Natalia had come to realize just how powerful Marcus was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kristen, Ronan's father, was merely the vice president of BioFusion Pharmaceuticals. Someone of his rank was nothing compared to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's fine. We're here to buy a car, so let's just wait here and see what they try to do," Marcus said, waving his hand dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia had been eyeing the Lamborghini for a while, and there was only one 4S shop in Kingston that sold it. Marcus wanted to take care of all her needs before he left Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Marcus' words, Natalia didn't say anything more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that Marcus was about to teach someone a lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wilder, these guys have no idea how close they are to death. When your dad arrives, don't let them off easy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing how calm Marcus and Natalia remained, Lara gritted her teeth and said to Ronan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronan sneered and nodded. "Don't worry, my dad knows the leader of the Silver Horn Order, Eamon McCallany. The Silver Horn Order is the most powerful gang under the Axe Gang. Once their people arrive, this guy will definitely not have a good ending!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
