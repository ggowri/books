  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shot him a glare. "Mr. Fitzgerald," she said, "you're surrounded by beautiful women. Aren't they enough for you? Why are you touching me again?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus chuckled, "The grass is always greener at home."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana rolled her eyes. She hadn't expected Marcus to be so shameless. For a moment, she was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your cultivation has improved again?" Though Marcus had tried to suppress his aura, Diana's senses were sharp, and she instantly detected the change in his energy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You could say that," Marcus replied with a smile and a nod.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A flicker of surprise crossed Diana's beautiful eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, a tremendously powerful aura erupted from Diana, instantly enveloping her. The terrifying pressure seemed to freeze everything in the room, including Marcus!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus glanced at Diana, realizing she was trying to test his strength. He didn't hold </span><span>back and released his aura. Though Marcus' cultivation was only at the Acquired Return Essence Realm Stage Four, he had cultivated the Hidden State, and combined with his exceptional ability to challenge opponents above his level, his current strength was in no way inferior to Diana's.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Marcus' aura was released, Diana's was immediately suppressed, unable to hold him back. This caused a flash of surprise to cross Diana's eyes, her face filled with disbelief!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was a peak level nine Demon Fighter, just one step away from reaching a higher realm. Before this, Diana had always believed that her current strength was undoubtedly the most powerful among Demon Fighters. Yet, at this moment, her full-force aura, meant to pressure Marcus, was effortlessly dispelled by him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, just how powerful had Marcus become? At that moment, Diana was filled with disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, how are you so strong?" she asked, her big, watery eyes wide with astonishment. "I remember you broke through to the Return Essence stage less than a month ago. How did you do it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's so surprising about it?" Marcus replied with a grin. "If you were willing to engage in more Dual Cultivation with me, my progress would be even faster!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, he pulled Diana down on top of him and began kissing her passionately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>Mmm</span><span>..." Diana barely had time to react before Marcus pinned her to the seat. Just as she was about to speak, his lips met hers. The intense sensation sent shivers through her body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald," she protested weakly, "weren't we having a serious discussion? Why are you doing this to me?" Diana tried to struggle free, but it was no use.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She used to think of Marcus as a nobody. She had watched him grow step by step. Yet, in less than half a year, he had become someone she could no longer reach. It gave Diana a surreal feeling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, Marcus was taking what he wanted from Diana, and she was utterly defenseless. The reason was simple: Marcus was no longer someone she could contend with. In other words, whatever Marcus wanted to do to her, she could only passively endure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus, of course, paid no attention to Diana's words. With the rapid growth of his cultivation, he felt his desires intensifying. Sometimes, it only took a small thing to ignite the fire within him. Just now, seeing Diana in that sexy professional attire and black stockings, Marcus couldn't restrain himself. He felt an overwhelming urge to do something to her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald," Diana said anxiously, "we're in the car. Please, not here. Can't we wait until we get home?" Even though the car had a partition, and the driver couldn't hear what was happening in the back, Diana still felt uncomfortable. It was just not private enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then come find me when we get home," Marcus said to Diana. "I have something to give you."</span></p><div class="pagination">
