  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, the </span><span>Ophidian</span><span>'s ambush was nothing more than child's play to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a single gesture, an invisible force erupted, </span><span>he </span><span>swiftly pull</span><span>ed</span><span> the </span><span>Ophidian</span><span>'s body into his palm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His large hand directly gripped the serpent man's throat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tell me, are those young girls being held in the depths of the cave?"</span><span>Marcus</span><span> asked coldly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Ophidian's body trembled, instantly sensing the threat of death. He dared not resist and said in a trembling voice, "Yes, they're inside the cave... Please, I beg you, spare my life..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, before the Ophidian could finish speaking, </span><span>Marcus</span><span> had already snapped his throat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Help... help...!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>F</span><span>aint cries for help from young women came from deep within the cave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, the voices rose and fell, not from one person but a group of people.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This further confirmed what the Ophidian had said earlier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"To think that such a brave person like you exists in this world, daring to trespass into the cave of us Lemurians and kill </span><span>us</span><span>. You're simply too arrogant!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as </span><span>Marcus</span><span> and </span><span>Gertie</span><span> arrived at a spacious area deep within the cave, an icy voice suddenly emerged from the void.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately after, the entire cave was enveloped by an immensely powerful aura.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The aura was terrifyingly overwhelming, instantly locking onto </span><span>Marcus</span><span>'s location.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under the pressure of that aura, </span><span>Gertie</span><span>'s delicate face instantly turned pale, and </span><span>she </span><span>even </span><span>found it</span><span> extremely difficult</span><span> to breathe</span><span>!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get lost!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling the attack from that aura, </span><span>Marcus</span><span> let out an angry roar and immediately unleashed a </span><span>Fist Ray</span><span> toward the void.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The </span><span>F</span><span>ist </span><span>Ray</span><span>, unstoppable like a breaking bamboo, pierced through the heavens and earth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next moment, a thunderous explosion echoed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Terrifying destructive </span><span>forces</span><span> erupted in the void, instantly shattering that oppressive force into pieces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie</span><span> was able to catch her breath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, not far from where </span><span>Marcus</span><span>'s </span><span>Fist Ray</span><span> landed, a figure emerged.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The figure was tall, clad in golden armor, with nine snake-shaped heads, each baring sharp fangs in their gaping mouths.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Beneath the nine snake heads was still a human body, exuding a chilling and terrifying aura.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, his cultivation </span><span>level </span><span>was incredibly terrifying, reaching the level </span><span>of </span><span>Acquired State Seven!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sensing the opponent's cultivation level, </span><span>Marcus</span><span>'s gaze slightly narrowed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was likely the strongest opponent he had encountered so far, apart from Ali</span><span>son</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And despite only being at Acquired State Seven, the creature&rsquo;s bloodline and physical strength easily pushed him to the level of an Acquired State Nine warrior</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, even though the opponent's </span><span>attack</span><span> was shattered by </span><span>Marcus</span><span>'s punch, </span><span>Gertie</span><span> could still feel the unbearable pressure, with cold sweat appearing on her forehead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is... a</span><span>n </span><span>Acquired State</span><span> </span><span>Seven </span><span>expert... </span><span>Marcus</span><span>... what should we do?"</span><span> </span><span>Gertie</span><span> naturally sensed the opponent's cultivation level as well, her face pale as she asked, her voice trembling violently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry, he's no match for me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus</span><span> gave </span><span>Gertie</span><span> a reassuring look.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie</span><span> was somewhat skeptical, as the opponent's cultivation level was simply too powerful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So powerful that even her family's ancestor couldn't compare.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, in </span><span>Gertie</span><span>'s view, under such circumstances, no matter how strong </span><span>Marcus</span><span> was, he might not be a match for this </span><span>creature</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Heh, you prisoner, what are you talking about? I really don't understand where your confidence comes from</span><span>. How</span><span> dare </span><span>you speak so arrogantly</span><span> in front of me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What </span><span>Marcus</span><span> had said </span><span>naturally reached the </span><span>Ophidian</span><span>'s ears, causing him to immediately let out an extremely mocking laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you the legendary </span><span>Rivers</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus</span><span> ignored the </span><span>opponent</span><span>'s arrogant words and asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The </span><span>opponent</span><span>'s gaze slightly tightened, and a look of surprise appeared on his face, not expecting </span><span>Marcus</span><span> to actually recognize him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since you know who I am, why don't you kneel and surrender immediately? Or are you waiting for me to strike you down?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus</span><span> sneered as well, a playful smile appearing on his face, and said, "It seems you're quite confident in your strength. How about this, I'll give you a chance. If you can withstand three moves from me, I'll spare your life. If not, then </span><span>you will make for excellent</span><span> nourishment!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as these words were spoken, </span><span>Rivers</span><span> even thought he had misheard</span><span>. He</span><span> never imagin</span><span>ed</span><span> in his wildest dreams that this guy in front of him would love to talk </span><span>like this</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kid, are you </span><span>crazy</span><span>? Or is there something wrong with your head</span><span>?</span><span> </span><span>How </span><span>dar</span><span>e you act </span><span>so arrogant</span><span>ly</span><span> in front of me? Since that's the case, I really want to see how you'll kill me within three moves!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While speaking, </span><span>Rivers</span><span> had already released the aura from his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, golden light shone around him, enveloping him in an incredibly terrifying aura.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, he unleashed an extremely terrifying </span><span>Fist Ray</span><span> toward </span><span>Marcus</span><span>...</span></p><div class="pagination">
