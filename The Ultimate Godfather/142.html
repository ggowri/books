        <h1>Chapter 141 Catherine's Father</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura frowned, somewhat convinced by Thomas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had helped a lot during her hospitalization. In her impression, he wouldn't lie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, is it true?" Laura asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled, "As he pleases. I don't want to argue."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura seemed to regard Marcus as Catherine's boyfriend and wanted him to change his bad habits, so she said, "Marcus, you should be down-to-earth. You can only buy what you can afford. Don't try to be pretentious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be angry with my advice. I have more experience and know more than you do. I don't want you to go astray."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine immediately winked at Laura. "Mom, stop talking. Mr. Fitzgerald knows everything. I believe he is not what Thomas said. He has never lied to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura joked, "Catherine, you haven't even gotten married yet, but you're already defending Marcus. I'm not saying he's a bad man!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just want him to be more down-to-earth. Young people all like to show off, but they also need to be more practical. If you get married in the future, what if he always thinks about unrealistic things?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Laura's speech grew outrageous, Catherine blushed with embarrassment and cast an apologetic glance at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing that Laura had no bad intentions and just liked to nag, he wasn't angry at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a common problem among most elderly people. They usually preferred to talk about some big principles. In fact, they had no malicious intentions and just wished the people they cared about to break some bad habits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas grinned from ear to ear. That was exactly what he wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Marcus dared to fool him with a fake product from Amazon, he would humiliate him in front of Catherine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, did you hear that? I think Laura has a point. Contemplate her words, and don't try to be pretentious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the Volkswagen Bora is really not working, just buy a new car according to your financial situation, and don't aim too high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't pretend to be rich by using high-end imitations bought from Amazon. I am kind. If it is someone who enjoys laughing at others, you will make a fool of yourself!" Thomas continued to mock Marcus, pretending to be virtuous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked, "How did you confirm that my key was bought from Amazon? Have you seen my order?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas was stunned. Then, he retorted, "If you open your Amazon, there will definitely be an order for the fake key. Why are you still quibbling about it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine glared at him and said, "Thomas, mind your language. I invited you here today to thank you for your help. Don't spoil our evening!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas stared at Marcus with disdain and stopped talking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the door of Catherine's house was pushed open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A middle-aged man, drunk and slovenly, entered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Catherine's father, Philip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're having dinner. Why didn't you call me? Are you secretly eating delicious food?" Philip growled, gazing at the sumptuous meal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the influence, he staggered, and his drunken look was disgusting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, why are you blaming me? I've called you several times before, and you've always said you were out drinking with friends and would not be home for dinner. How come you've forgotten now?" Catherine asked aggrievedly. There was nothing she could do about Philip.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He either drank or gambled. His dissatisfaction was a common occurrence when he came home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip loved to find fault. In the prime of his life, he also abused Laura. It was only when Catherine grew up that he changed slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he never gave up gambling and lost everything at home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip said, "When did you call me, you bitch? You are really talking nonsense. I think you don't have me as your father!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, he took out a bottle of Everclear from the bedroom. Then, he pulled a stool to sit down, filled a glass, and gulped it down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine glanced at Marcus and Thomas apologetically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were both aware of her family situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Thomas looked at Philip with disgust and deliberately moved his stool to the side, staying away from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Catherine, are these two guys your friends?" Philip asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine nodded and told him about how Marcus and Thomas had helped her and Laura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip turned a deaf ear to it and didn't take the so-called favor seriously at all. He said, "I don't care. If they want you, I will marry you to whoever is wealthy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something occurred to him. He asked, "By the way, which of you drove the sports car downstairs? It looks quite new. It should be recently bought, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His questions shocked Thomas. He asked, "Philip, are you sure there is a new sports car downstairs?"</span></p></div>
