  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera knew that her words came from the heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She did like Marcus more than words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She genuinely adored Marcus, and not just as a crush&mdash;it was a deep, reverential love that had grown within her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The chance to be intimate with the man she deeply loved was something no woman could resist.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, due to her reserved nature, Kiera was too shy to directly address matters of the heart, which made her hesitant to express her true desires.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, her actions were a true reflection of her feelings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Would you be mine?" Marcus asked, clearly impressed by Kiera.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Something about her demure appearance sparked a conquering desire in him, stirring the mystical energies of the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire within him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was a reaction he had never felt with any other woman.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The first time, he revealed his desire for a girl.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At Marcus' question, Kiera's heart raced even faster, almost overwhelming her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, she nodded vigorously. "I would love to be..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I would be honored to be your woman. Honestly, since the first time I saw you, I've had a great impression of you," Kiera confessed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since then, you've helped me and my sister's family and used your miraculous medical skills to cure my condition.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That encounter was my first intimate experience with a man, and since then, I've </span><span>known you were the one.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But feeling unworthy, I've kept this love hidden deep within my heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I know now that my heart can't accept anyone but you.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I can't be with you, I'd rather not marry at all."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After expressing her true feelings, Kiera felt a weight lift off her shoulders.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No longer constrained by modesty, she laid bare all her thoughts to Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her words were sincere, all from the deepest of her heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They could also explain why she had rejected all other suitors her mother had introduced.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her heart had been stolen by Marcus, never to be returned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus was deeply touched by the purity and earnestness of the young woman before him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He pulled her close again, gently stroking her smooth hair, and asked, "What if I told you there are others in my life, not just one, would that bother you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt it was important to be upfront.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus disliked deceit, and if Kiera couldn't accept this, he would never overstep boundaries.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking up at him, her eyes filled with adoration, Kiera responded, "I've always known, Mr. Fitzgerald. How could a man as outstanding as you not be admired by many?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In this world, which capable man doesn't have admirers? Although the law no longer allows polygamy, it's common for men of stature to have several partners.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With someone as exceptional as you, it's normal. I fully accept this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, I promise not to harbor any ill will towards them. If I meet them, I'll treat them as sisters; if not, I won't interfere."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Kiera appeared remarkably understanding.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She exuded a quiet, intellectual charm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus felt a deep sense of gratitude.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking back, he realized that none of the women in his life had ever engaged in petty jealousy or competition.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was something he deeply appreciated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It only made him cherish the women around him even more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're truly wonderful..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He caressed her cheek tenderly, filled with affection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that, Kiera leaned forward and initiated a kiss, catching Marcus off guard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This unexpected gesture only deepened his feelings for her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his experience, Kiera was always reserved and would never act out of line.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, at this moment, she seemed overwhelmed by her feelings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling the softness of her lips and the tenderness behind her kiss, Marcus couldn't hold back anymore and passionately returned her kisses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As his intensity grew, so did Kiera's thrill.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She started to moan softly, her body twisting in his embrace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' </span><span>tongue</span><span> boldly explored her mouth, savoring the sweetness within.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera responded hesitantly at first, but soon, her tongue tangled with his in a dance of </span><span>mutual desire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each touch sent waves of urgency through them, amplifying Kiera's moans.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was just the beginning.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gently, Marcus began to unfasten the buttons at the back of Kiera's dress.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Slowly, he peeled the upper part of her sheer dress down, revealing her smooth skin.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her breasts, though not as large as Jane's, were perfectly shaped under the soft cotton of her bra, creating an enticing view.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus couldn't resist and cupped one, feeling its firmness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every time he </span><span>squeezed,</span><span> it sent shivers through Kiera.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her soft moans gradually turned into deep gasps.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her voice, naturally melodious, made her moans even more enticing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Marcus removed her bra, freeing her breasts completely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were not just smooth and firm but also topped with soft, pink nipples.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite her slim frame, her breasts were impressively proportioned, making her even more alluring.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera, standing about five feet five and weighing barely 100 pounds, seemed delicate, but her bust was surprisingly generous, barely held in hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was much to Marcus' delight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at her perfect breasts, Marcus felt a surge of desire, his body reacting instinctively.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So shy..." Kiera murmured, her cheeks flushing as she instinctively covered her chest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus gently pulled her hands away and took her nipple into his mouth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera gasped, the sensation overwhelming her as she felt an electric charge through her body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moisture at her inner thighs increased, dampening her panties.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus... Why am I so sensitive here? It feels so strange..." Kiera asked, looking down at Marcus as he continued to lavish attention on her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he suckled, his tongue flicked across her sensitive peaks, eliciting waves of pleasure that made Kiera moan louder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her hands reached for the back of his head, urging him to intensify his actions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't pause to answer; he was too caught up in the taste and scent of her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It aroused his deepest desire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After thoroughly enjoying one, he moved to the other, doubling the stimulation, driving Kiera's desire to new heights.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her moans became deeper, more revealing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Marcus kissed her, his hand wandered lower, slipping under her panties to find her already slick and warm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His fingers easily slid inside, and with just that touch, Kiera's desire swelled immensely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His touch was like some electricity, making her shudder powerfully,</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, a wave of warmth flooding out to envelop his fingers.</span></p><div class="pagination">
