  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Diana could react, Marcus had once again pinned her beneath him, initiating another passionate encounter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the room was filled with a symphony of sounds.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the adjacent room, Jane and Pearl struggled to contain their curiosity and longing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That Marcus," Jane whispered, her cheeks flushing. "He has no sense of restraint about that kind of thing. It's making me feel so restless."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she spoke, Jane's hands began unconsciously to caress her own body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, Marcus and Diana's passionate encounter lasted two hours before finally subsiding. Exhausted, they slept soundly until 9:00 the next morning.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Normally, Diana would be up early preparing breakfast, but she had overslept. Pearl, taking over her duties, had prepared a delicious spread.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they ate, Jane's eyes twinkled with playful mischief as she glanced back and forth between Marcus and Diana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana, of course, understood the meaning behind Jane's gaze. Her cheeks flushed crimson, and she kept her head down, avoiding Jane's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, what happened yesterday? You slept in until after nine o'clock! That's not like you," Jane teased.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus shot Jane a playful glare. "Diana has a lot to do daily, so naturally, she gets tired. It's not the same for you. What's wrong with sleeping in a little?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane smirked. "I admit Diana works hard, but I believe there might be another reason she got up late this morning."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this, Diana's cheeks flushed a deep crimson, resembling a ripe red apple.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hey, don't go making things up," Marcus interjected, trying to shield Diana from further embarrassment. "You're making her blush."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane giggled. "Marcus, why are you so protective of Diana? The reason she got up late has something to do with you, you know!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Uh..." Marcus stammered, at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane continued, "With the way you were carrying on, it's a wonder anyone could get any sleep. If it were me, I probably wouldn't be up until noon!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jane, please!" Diana </span><span>pleaded,</span><span> her face now as red as a fully ripened apple.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Pearl, listening to the exchange, couldn't help but stifle a laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The breakfast proceeded amidst laughter and playful banter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Having been preoccupied with other matters recently, Marcus had neglected his business ventures. After breakfast, he decided to catch up on his visits to the Golden Group, the Golden Pharmaceutical Industrial Park, and the Bayside Petroleum Company.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At each stop, Marcus shared the management insights he had gained from his experience with the McHale Pharmaceuticals Group. He encouraged his teams to emulate the practices of this century-old company.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Michelle, Yvonne, and the Bayside Petroleum Company executives were deeply impressed by the McHale model. They recognized that a company with a century-long track record in the cutthroat pharmaceutical industry, now ranking among the top three globally, must have unique and valuable management strategies that upstart </span><span>companies could only dream of.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After visiting his companies, Marcus went to Serpent's Coil to check on their progress.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jalen had already become a Level Five Wizard, and the magic squad had reached Level Four Wizard at their highest. Edgar had just advanced to Ancient Martial Stage Three yesterday.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although their progress might still seem slow compared to Marcus', it was already quite remarkable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking back, Jalen and the others had only been training for three or four months, yet they had already achieved a level that surpassed most of the prodigies from other Ancient Martial Art Sects.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus was pleased with their progress.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before leaving, he left a wealth of training resources for Serpent's Coil. These resources were spoils from his battles with various opponents.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For Marcus, these low-level resources were no longer useful. But for the members of Serpent's Coil, they were all precious treasures.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jalen and the others were naturally extremely grateful, promising that they would work hard in their training to repay Marcus for his support.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Marcus was about to return to Bayside Villa, he encountered a familiar figure on the roadside.</span></p><div class="pagination">
