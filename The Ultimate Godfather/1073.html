  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally, a breakthrough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus let out a long breath, his eyes gleaming with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his current pace, it wouldn't be long before his cultivation surpassed the Acquired State, pushing him into the Innate State.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And when that happened, his strength would undergo yet another terrifying transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but look forward to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At 9:00 AM, Chloe slowly woke up, her entire body aching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shot a sharp glare at Marcus and groaned, "I'm so sore... This is all your fault! I feel like my bones are about to fall apart&mdash;how could you do this to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Chloe's alluring expression, Marcus couldn't help but pull her into his arms again, gently stroking her silky hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Doesn't that just prove how irresistible you are?" Marcus teased with a smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe rolled her eyes at him, her gaze sultry and full of playful resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to get up," she sighed. "I have a performance today&mdash;I can't miss it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow. "The superstar is back to work?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe nodded firmly. "Even celebrities are just workers at the end of the day. I spend my days making money for my boss, and my nights getting tormented by my boss. Poor me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, Marcus was confused&mdash;then it hit him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was calling him her boss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but roll his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't think I can handle you calling me your boss in that sense," he replied. "How about this? Even though you're officially signed under Royal Entertainment, from now on, the company won't take any commission from your performances. You keep 100% of what you earn. How does that sound?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe's eyes lit up instantly, her face flashing with pure excitement. "Wait&mdash;are you serious?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled. "Of course I am. Why would I lie to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, you're the best!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overjoyed, Chloe leaned in and kissed his cheek, her smile brighter than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the entertainment industry, most artists had to hand over a huge percentage of their earnings to their agencies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless they were A-list megastars who had the power to negotiate their contracts, singers like Chloe, who had just broken into the upper ranks, were still required to give up a huge cut of their pay. For example, with a five-million-dollar performance fee, most of it would go straight to Royal Entertainment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now? Marcus had just promised not to take a single cent from her earnings. That meant Chloe's income was about to skyrocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked at the beautiful woman in his arms, feeling the urge to pull her back down onto the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he resisted. Chloe had a performance to get to, and his sessions lasted at least two hours&mdash;he simply didn't have enough time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After parting ways with Chloe, Marcus originally planned to head back to Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, his phone rang. It was his adoptive mother, Melinda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, do you have time today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gentle voice came through the receiver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, what's up?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It suddenly occurred to him that he hadn't visited his adoptive parents in nearly a month, and he felt a pang of guilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, he had bought them a luxury villa in Solomia and hired multiple maids to take care of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His father and mother were living in complete comfort, and as for his younger sister, Nicole, she was doing well at Solomia Institute of Technology.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nicole's coming home for winter break today," Melinda explained. "She has a lot of stuff to bring back, and the dorm won't let her store everything there. I was hoping you could drive over and help her move. If you're busy, your father and I will just take a cab."</span></p><div class="pagination">
