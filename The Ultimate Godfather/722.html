  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was ridiculous that Atlas was proud of being the sales manager of Bayside Petroleum Company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even flaunted his supposed superiority before Marcus while relying on this very identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, everything he had meant nothing to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More ridiculously, in an attempt to rival Marcus in terms of financial power, Atlas went so far as to disclose to everyone the acts of corruption that he and Hector had been involved in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, he was beaten up by Hector, and Hector was arrested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How ironic!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, a squad of police officers arrived at Natalie's residence and carted off Atlas, who was battered and barely conscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hector was under suspicion of embezzling large amounts of money. As his right-hand man, Atlas, of course, couldn't escape being implicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both of them would face severe prison sentences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Atlas was taken away, the Vance family reverted to its former tranquility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps because the atmosphere was awkward, no one spoke for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cora finally broke the silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said with embarrassment, "I was completely unaware of Atlas' true, despicable character. Otherwise, I would never have introduced him to Natalie. Well, if there's nothing else, I'll take my leave now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she left Natalie's residence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie and the others did not stop her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Payne smiled, "Marcus, we misunderstood you before. Please don't take it to heart. I apologize!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edwin said somewhat embarrassedly, "Well, Marcus, it's all our fault. Don't get angry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus cast a casual glance at Payne and Edwin without saying anything. He then fixed his eyes on Natalie and murmured, "It's getting late. I should leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he said goodbye to Mia and turned away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staring at his back, Payne and Edwin were filled with regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They understood that Marcus was still furious with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edwin, in particular, was incredibly regretful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that if he had not constantly defended Atlas and had not disdained Marcus, considering Natalie's connection with Marcus, any favor Marcus bestowed upon him would have enabled him to live a life of ease for the remainder of his days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was too late now. Edwin could only wait for an opportunity to mend his relationship with Marcus gradually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll see you off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing that Marcus was about to leave, Natalie immediately chased after him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He naturally did not refuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They soon walked downstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus got into his Audi A6, and Natalie took her place in the front passenger seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gazed at him and said apologetically, "Marcus, I'm so sorry. I had planned to invite you to my place for dinner, but things got ruined. How about we go to a restaurant now and have dinner? It's on me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't decline. He simply nodded and asked, "What would you like to eat?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A radiant smile lit up Natalie's face, making her look especially breathtaking. "Since I'm the one treating, we definitely have to go for something really good. Let's head to a Michelin-starred restaurant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised his eyebrows slightly, shook his head, and said, "Why go there? I'm not fond of the food at Michelin-starred restaurants. I'm aware of a night market in the vicinity. There's a barbecue joint there that's incredibly delicious. I can take you to try it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie immediately beamed with joy and replied, "Sure. I haven't eaten barbecue for a long time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They cheerfully reached an agreement, and in just five minutes of driving, they arrived at the night market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was already 5:00 in the evening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An increasing number of people flocked to the night market. The stalls were filled with the clamorous sounds of hawkers promoting their wares.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus led Natalie to the very joint, where he was a regular, and took a seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Prior to his divorce from Abigail, he frequently dined at this particular joint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For numerous years, it had always been extremely popular. Its meat skewers were fresh, and they were cooked to perfection with just the right amount of time spent on </span><span>the grill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no hint of excessive seasoning. The main allure was the natural flavor of the meat itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just order whatever you want. This barbecue joint won't let you down," Marcus chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You order. I'll be happy with whatever you choose," Natalie said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus ordered some skewers of meat and two bottles of beverages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The owner of this joint worked efficiently, and the delicious skewers were soon served.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It smells so good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie was instantly drawn in by the enticing aroma of the skewers. She took a delicate bite, and her lovely face was suffused with contentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I've told you that the food at the barbecue joint is really delicious and won't disappoint you," Marcus laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie nodded vigorously, and soon, her mouth became greasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time went by, more and more people came to the night market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was very noisy but lively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Natalie asked, "Marcus, did you really mean to transfer 20 billion dollars to me as a gift?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If your intention was merely to humiliate Atlas, I'll give you back the money right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked at Natalie deeply and grumbled, "Why are you asking such a thing? Do you really think I'd offer you money simply to humiliate Atlas?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling that she had said something wrong, she shook her head at once.</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
