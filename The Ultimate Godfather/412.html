  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yvonne, please don't scare me! Yvonne, you have to hang on, you can't give up now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Charles gripped Yvonne's hand tightly, his face twisted in a mixture of rage and helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emily stood next to him, her eyes swollen from crying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This curse is too evil... If Marcus doesn't return soon, she's really going to die," Diana said, her voice tinged with despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emily's face went pale at the words, nearly collapsing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Charles looked as though he might explode with frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Yvonne seemed on the verge of losing her life to the blood curse, the doorbell rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Charles and Emily rushed to the door, opening it together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There, standing in a blood-streaked shirt, was Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, you're back! Yvonne's going to be okay, this is incredible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Charles' face lit up with an ecstatic joy he couldn't hide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus walked briskly to Yvonne's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, did you succeed?" Diana asked with an eager, almost anxious look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without wasting any time, he began circulating his energy, carefully feeding the blood energy he had taken from Eden Child into Yvonne's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the energy flowed in, Yvonne's complexion began to improve, her breath becoming more regular.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her vital signs surged back to life, slowly but surely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the blood energy poured into her, the curse that had wrapped itself around her began to crack and crumble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, with a silent shudder, the curse collapsed entirely and vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Phew..." Marcus let out a deep breath, his tense muscles relaxing for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though Yvonne hadn't regained consciousness yet, with the curse gone, Marcus knew she was out of danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The reason she hadn't woken was simply because the curse had drained so much of her life force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, you've saved her! She's going to be okay! I can't thank you enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Charles' face beamed with gratitude and joy as he looked at his daughter's recovering form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He immediately bowed deeply, but Marcus stopped him, holding up a hand. "No need for that, Mr. Miller. This was my responsibility. I couldn't just sit back and watch Yvonne suffer, especially since we're good friends," Marcus said with a faint smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Charles nodded, and Emily, eyes filled with emotion, looked at Marcus. "How long until Yvonne wakes up?" she asked, her voice full of hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She'll be awake within an hour. After a couple of days of rest, she'll be as good as new," Marcus replied, his tone reassuring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana pulled Marcus aside, her eyes sharp with curiosity. "What level was the Curse Weaver you killed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus paused, then answered with a casual tone, "A third-stage Curse Weaver."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wasn't lying&mdash;he simply preferred to keep his real abilities under wraps, not wanting to show off too much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I bet it was Mr. Roger Gellar who sent him," Diana said, a glint of suspicion in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're right," Marcus answered, his expression darkening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After today's events, it was clear that his second brother's intentions had become far more dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Curse Weaver had been one of the strongest enemies Marcus had ever faced, even stronger than Asher Dupont, the Grand Elder of the Astral Serpent Order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If not for his variety of life-saving techniques, Marcus wasn't sure he would have made it through Eden Child's attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It made him realize just how critical his own power was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though his growth had been rapid, his second brother's hired assassins were catching up fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was clear that Marcus would need to accelerate his own training if he hoped to stay ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An hour later, Yvonne stirred, her eyelids fluttering open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The first thing she saw was Marcus' familiar face, looking as handsome as ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus... What happened? I had the longest nightmare... There was this bloodthirsty demon chasing me... I thought I was going to die..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne's voice was faint, barely more than a whisper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yvonne, it's okay now. Mr. Fitzgerald saved you," Charles said, his voice full of relief and gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana briefly explained the situation to Yvonne, though she left out the details about the blood curse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne, being an ordinary person, wouldn't be able to understand the concept of a blood curse. It was better for her mental state if she never found out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus, thank you... Thank you for saving me," Yvonne said, her eyes shimmering with gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus looked uncomfortable, quickly shaking his head. "There's no need for thanks, Yvonne. This was partly my fault."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He took out a healing pill from his Spatial Ring and helped Yvonne swallow it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Almost immediately, Yvonne's strength began to return, the pill doing its job.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In moments, she was nearly back to normal, though still a bit weaker than usual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just a couple more days, and you'll be back on your feet," Marcus assured her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once he was sure Yvonne was stable, Marcus took a deep breath, his mission complete. He made his way out of the Miller house, heading back to Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the battle, Marcus had sustained a few injuries, and he knew he needed time to heal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he spent the night refining the energy he had absorbed, converting it into his own power, and preparing for the next challenge.</span></p><div class="pagination">
