        <h1>Chapter 675 Is Mr. Fitzgerald Really Reliable?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone glanced over and saw a figure supporting Ophelia's delicate body, preventing her from crashing to the floor and suffering further harm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was none other than Marcus!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia exhaled a long sigh, and her face turned slightly pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was not afraid of being thrown, but the fall would most likely spell the end of her career. "Sir, thank you for your help!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia gave Marcus a grateful smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From this perspective, she was quite stunning, with the same healthy beauty as Shannon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're welcome."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus helped Ophelia up gentlemanly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, you are finally here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Shannon strode over. Marcus noticed that she looked extremely haggard with a pallid face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did he understand why she did not go on stage to fight Moreno.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus vaguely remembered that he had once taught Shannon a cultivation method, and now almost a month had passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She ought to have achieved some success. Despite not becoming a master, she should have been able to handle Moreno in the ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, her menstrual period made it inconvenient for her to engage in combat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you okay?" Marcus asked with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shannon shook her head slightly and replied, "Yes. I just have cramps."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shannon, who is this?" Ophelia asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been fighting against Moreno in the ring and thus had no idea that Shannon had asked Marcus for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is Mr. Fitzgerald I've been talking about. He once beat a 9th-dan black belt master from Crankhurst. It will be no problem for him to deal with Moreno!" Shannon said with confidence, for she knew that Marcus was anything but ordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His strength was far beyond the reach of common fighting masters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, certain matters were meant to be kept secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Hello, </span><span>Mr. Fitzgerald. I am Ophelia Perkins, the owner of the Iron Fist Club. I've heard of you before. It's a great honor to meet you in person!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia extended her hand to Marcus, and he shook hands with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Moreno noticed Marcus. His big eyes became extremely sharp, and he asked, "Hey, who are you? It seems that you want to play the hero and save the beauty?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus stepped forward and said, "You aren't worthy of knowing my name. You are here to challenge the Iron Fist Club, and I will fight you on its behalf."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished his words, many people fixed their eyes on Marcus with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreno laughed mockingly, "Do you have any idea who I am? I'm the provincial heavyweight champion. A weakling like you isn't fit to challenge me. You'd better not attempt something that's way out of your league!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring his ridicule, Marcus walked up to the ring step by step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon arriving there, he had already pieced together the specific details of the incident from the remarks of the onlookers nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Apis Boxing Club had no bottom line in its pursuit of attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Allowing heavyweight male athletes to fight female athletes was nothing short of a violation of fundamental fairness in combat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Also given</span><span> Shannon's pleadings, Marcus was determined to teach the Apis Boxing Club a lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Marcus actually had the audacity to step into the ring, Moreno sneered, "Hey, you should be aware that once you set foot in this ring, there'll be no turning back. Even if I cripple you, you'll just have to suck it up. Got it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After casting a glance at Moreno, Marcus shouted at the crowd below the ring, "Everyone from the Apis Boxing Club can come up together to attack me. That'll save us some time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His statement stunned everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the members of the Apis Boxing Club burst into laughter. It had never crossed their minds that this ordinary-looking young man could be so arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't even defeat Moreno, the provincial heavyweight champion. How dare he propose to confront everyone from the Apis Boxing Club together? He was simply daydreaming!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Somewhat embarrassed, Ophelia couldn't help asking, "Shannon, is Mr. Fitzgerald really reliable? I feel like he is boasting..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a combat competition, when both parties were professional fighters, the disparity in their strength typically wasn't that significant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even one against two was a very difficult task, let alone one against many.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was so full of hubris that he dared to take on the entire Apis Boxing Club by himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though surprised by Marcus' high-profile demeanor, Shannon nodded to Ophelia confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Ms. Perkins. He is powerful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia narrowed her eyes, still feeling somewhat worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't withstand a single blow from my iron-like fist, but you still want to fight a group of people. Have you completely lost your senses?" Moreno said sarcastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Below the ring, a member of the Apis Boxing Club exclaimed, "Moreno, cut the crap and knock him out with one punch. Then, he will no longer be so arrogant!"</span></p></div>
