We're on the same side!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Same side, shut up! You old fool, if you dare speak another word, I'll smash your mouth to pieces!" Landon roared, completely losing his usual composed demeanor and resembling a mad person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even so, he's still my father. Don't you care about my feelings when you hit him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe was still unable to detach herself from the delusion of being Landon's girlfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words were spoken as if she still held a privileged position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish, Landon slapped her across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You wretch! You're the real culprit here! If it weren't for you dragging me to the Thurman family, how could I have possibly offended Marcus? You're nothing but bad luck!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While speaking, he couldn't help but slap her again, causing the other cheek to become red and swollen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe, her face full of grievance, said to Landon, "Mr. Whitman, even though Marcus has an extraordinary status, you are still the heir of the Whitman family. Why do you fear him so much?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Landon kicked her to the ground and sneered, "You really are an idiot. Marcus even has </span><span>Battle God</span><span> Oliver trembling before him. Do you think the title of the Whitman family's heir means anything to someone like him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't ever mention my status as heir again. If I suffer at the hands of Marcus or Oliver because of you one more time, I'll kill you myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe collapsed on the ground, utterly despairing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could hardly believe how much Landon had changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before today, he had treated her like a treasure, caring for her with the utmost attentiveness and even promising to make her the future matriarch of the Whitman family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, all those dreams had shattered into nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe, unable to withstand the emotional blow, nearly fainted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And all this was because they offended Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reflecting on their circumstances, both Cloe and Neil were overwhelmed with regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A single wrong decision had irreversibly altered the trajectory of their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they were not only cast out of the Thurman family but also abandoned by Landon, leaving them completely destitute and with nowhere to turn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, was unaware of any of this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, he had already finished dinner and was walking on the small path in the villa grounds, holding Melina's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The soft lighting cast their silhouettes in a romantic glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, thank you so much for today. If it weren't for you, my grandfather might not have made it," Melina said, her face filled with admiration as she looked at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gently ruffled her hair. "I told you before I'd treat your grandfather. I always keep my promises."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Melina felt a twinge of guilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had doubted Marcus' medical skills before, and now she realized how foolish she had been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gazed at her delicate features and caught a faint whiff of the orchid fragrance lingering around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't resist any longer. He lowered his head and kissed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina let out a soft sound, her body instantly softening in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you miss me?" Marcus asked, his heart stirred by her fragrance, which only heightened his growing desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Innate Enchanting Physique's influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cultivation progress had greatly enhanced his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the enchanting atmosphere of the night, it became impossible for Marcus to suppress the emotions surging within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hand directly slid to her slim waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Melina wearing only a light dress, it didn't take much for him to feel her smooth skin beneath his touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina trembled under his caress, her voice alluring as she murmured, "Marcus, I've missed you so much. Ever since returning from Solomia, I've thought about you every day. But with my grandfather's worsening condition, I didn't have the time to visit you. Now that you're here, I'm so happy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She spoke between shallow breaths, her words blending with soft moans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had already taken off her underwear and dived deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Warm, wet, and slippery, and moved rhythmically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina let out an alluring sound, and her pretty face suddenly turned red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, please, don't tease me anymore. I can't take it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina's cheeks flushed as she pleaded. She couldn't handle it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a chuckle, Marcus kissed her deeply, fully engrossed in the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amid the intense sensations, Melina experienced an overwhelming sense of pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As their closeness deepened, the subtle scent of orchids lingered in the air, adding to the intimate atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The orchid scent lingering around her only made him lose himself further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overwhelmed by desire, he pressed Melina against a nearby wall, kissing her fervently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hands wandered as he lifted one of her legs, wrapping it around his waist, deepening their embrace.</span></p><div class="pagination">
