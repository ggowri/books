  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle quickly tidied up her desk and touched up her makeup, her heart racing as she approached Marcus' office. She knocked lightly on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come in!" Marcus' voice called from inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Michelle pushed the door open and stepped inside. Marcus was engrossed in reviewing documents, and the focus he exuded added a unique charm to his presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're here already?" he remarked, glancing up from his work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle felt a flutter of nerves as his eyes roamed over her. Today, there was something about her outfit that seemed to accentuate her chest more than usual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The buttons of her white blouse were straining against her, and she could feel the heat rising in her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't want you to wait too long, so I came right over," Michelle replied, feeling increasingly uneasy under his intense gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come here." Marcus beckoned, his voice low and inviting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle's heart raced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Summoning her courage, she asked, "Marcus... Are</span><span>n</span><span>'</span><span>t</span><span> we moving a bit too fast?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too fast? What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked genuinely puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not planning to do something... Well, you know, something inappropriate, are you? I mean, I wouldn't refuse you, but I feel like we should get to know each other better first. What if you find out something about me that you don't like?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She fiddled with the hem of her shirt, her voice soft and almost playing the coquetry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh..." Marcus realized she had misunderstood his intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I </span><span>call you to</span><span> give me a shoulder rub. Where did your mind wander off to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling a wave of embarrassment wash over her, Michelle blushed. "Oh... I see now. I'm sorry, Marcus, I totally overthought that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she moved behind him to start massaging his shoulders, a hint of disappointment lingered in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm... that feels nice," Marcus murmured, leaning back in his chair, and his eyes closed in relaxation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of silence, Marcus spoke up again, "</span><span>Actually, I do</span><span> </span><span>call you for</span><span> something important."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is it? I'm all ears," Michelle replied, her curiosity piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm appointing you as the general manager. I value your character, and I want you to be part of my team. Are you willing to commit to this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Michelle responded, "It would be an honor to serve you! Of course, I'm in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus lit a cigarette, exhaling a plume of smoke. "My ambitions go beyond just Golden Group. We're likely to face many challenges ahead, some of which could be death. If you have any second thoughts, now's the time to back out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle locked eyes with him, captivated by the intensity radiating from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nodded vigorously. "I'm in! As long as I can be by your side, I'd follow you anywhere&mdash;even into danger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since her father's death, Michelle had felt utterly alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with the entrenched old guard in the company, she had no power to fight back, let alone seek vengeance for her father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with Marcus, Michelle saw a glimmer of hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She realized he was a man she could trust with her life, both personally and professionally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good. I'm impressed by your determination," Marcus said, extinguishing his cigarette and sitting up straight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He added, "But let's get one thing clear: if you choose to follow me, there's no turning back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't even think about betraying me. If you do, you'll face dire consequences."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle couldn't help but shiver involuntarily and nodded </span><span>again</span><span>. "Rest assured. I have no second thoughts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus</span><span> waved a hand, </span><span>"</span><span>Well, g</span><span>o take care of your own business."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle acknowledged with a hum, ready to leave, but halfway there, she paused and turned back to Marcus. "Can you tell me if Anthony's death had anything to do with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus answered casually, "I killed him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the reality of the situation seemed surreal, Michelle chose to believe Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued, </span><span>"He was one of the people who drove my father to his death. By killing him, you've avenged me. The other person is Brandon Davis, known to the world as Mr. Davis."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brandon holds an additional 25% of the shares in the Golden Group and is known for his formidable power. In his youth, he was dubbed the number-one fighter in Solomia.</span><span> </span><span>There are rumors that he has intricate connections with an Ancient Martial Art Sect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"To truly grasp control of the Golden Group, you might find that Brandon isn't so easy to overcome."</span></p><div class="pagination">
