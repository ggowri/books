        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia's face turned even redder when she heard this, and she quickly picked up her underwear and hid it behind her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It caused Diana and Pearl to give Marcus strange looks, making him feel completely uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Natalia was on vacation, Diana prepared a table full of delicious food that evening to welcome her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus enjoyed a feast with the four women, then returned to his room to begin cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cultivation had already broken through to the peak of Acquired State Four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the help of pills that enhanced his cultivation and the miraculous effects of the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, </span><span>it </span><span>only</span><span> took</span><span> Marcus two hours to raise his cultivation to Acquired State Five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After advancing to the Return Essence stage, each breakthrough in cultivation brought earth-shattering improvements to his abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he had only advanced one State, Marcus' power had increased significantly again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he even had confidence in his ability to match up against an Innate Return Essence Realm Stage Two expert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this remained merely an estimate, which only existed in theory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having never encountered an Innate Return Essence Realm expert before, Marcus had no idea what level of power such masters truly possessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After his breakthrough, Marcus fully stabilized his cultivation an hour before retrieving the Spatial Rings from the three Tucker family elders.</span><span> One by one, he cracked their seals and inventoried their contents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As experts who had cultivated for countless years at the Return Essence stage, these three possessed terrifying wealth in their Spatial Rings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Marcus had mentally prepared himself, he couldn't help being shocked by what he found.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The money alone was staggering, but what surprised Marcus was the sheer abundance of pills, treasures, and weapons that left him speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each Spatial Ring </span><span>carried</span><span> more </span><span>value</span><span> than everything he currently owned!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those three Spatial Rings together nearly tripled Marcus' wealth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His trip to confront the Tucker family hadn't been in vain. At the very least, he'd gained an enormous supplement of cultivation resources, laying a solid foundation for his advancement to higher States.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he could casually pop pills like candy to break through to the next cultivation level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not because he could refine them himself but because he'd killed so many enemies and claimed their possessions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This surplus of cultivation resources was precisely why Marcus had to share </span><span>t</span><span>he </span><span>excess</span><span> with his important subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides all that, Marcus also conducted detailed research on the Rune Disk of the Dragon's Wrath Formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He discovered that this Dragon's Wrath Formation Rune Disk was far more intricate than when Brett had used it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he had previously suspected, Brett's control of the Dragon's Wrath Formation had barely utilized twenty percent of its true power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the energy of the Rune was contained within this Rune Disk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the Rune Disk seemed to have an internal barrier, with all its power waiting to be unlocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't rush the process; instead, he took time to familiarize himself with the </span><span>mastery of </span><span>Rune Disk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After just three hours, Marcus had mastered how to use the Dragon's Wrath Formation Rune Disk by applying his knowledge of the Heavenly Circle Diagram.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that once he uncovered all the potential of the Dragon's Wrath Formation, it would become a terrifying weapon of mass destruction!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had just gotten up early the next morning and entered the courtyard to stretch his body and breathe fresh air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, someone knocked on the front door of the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow slightly, walked over, and opened the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man and a woman stood outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both were dressed professionally and were in their late twenties.</span></p></div>
