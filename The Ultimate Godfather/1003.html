  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Brett's words, Gertie felt her eyelids twitch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, she still really enjoyed being with Yasser. She wanted to marry him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Gertie was now torn inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her innocence had been taken by Marcus, and she was no longer pure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Yasser was someone who placed great value on purity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie was overwhelmed with guilt. She hadn't wanted to deceive Yasser.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Brett spoke, Gertie almost nodded in agreement at one point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, she couldn't bring herself to do it. She spoke up directly, "I'm sorry, Mr. Brett Tucker. I'm not ready to marry Yasser yet. Please give me some more time to think things through."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she said this, many members of the Tucker family showed disappointment on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brett's face turned ashen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie's public refusal was a slap in the face to Brett, the head of the Tucker family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made him lose face in front of the senior members of the Tucker family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's more, his son Yasser had always wanted to marry Gertie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had become an obsession for both father and son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, after Gertie finished speaking, Yasser's face turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but ask Gertie, "Gertie, we've been together for decades. Why do you still reject me? Can you at least give me an answer?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie's face also turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, she didn't know how to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Yasser was about to press further, Gertie stood up from her seat and quickly left the banquet hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Yasser felt a surge of anger rise within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood up and chased after her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gertie, I don't understand why you can't accept me. Do you think I don't love you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or are you afraid I'll let you down?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I, Yasser, swear to God that I will love you with all my heart. If you agree to marry me, I'm willing to give you everything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie broke free from Yasser's grip and said, "Yasser, I know you love me and care for me deeply. I know you'll treat me well, but I'm just not ready to marry you yet. Please, give me some more time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser gripped Gertie's shoulders, his eyes locked on the woman he loved. "Give you some time? Can you at least tell me how long? Five years? Ten? Or twenty?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser grew more agitated as he spoke. He felt as though he had Gertie within his grasp, yet she remained out of reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, this was the most painful thing a man could endure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that he was always impatient, but his feelings for Gertie were so intense that he could no longer hold them back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being rejected by Gertie time and again had shattered his confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't give you a specific time. I hope you can understand. I just can't marry you right now. Please, stop pressing me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie's expression grew more troubled as she spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser's eyes narrowed, and a cold smile crept onto his lips. "Gertie, are you hiding something from me? You've been acting strange ever since I saw you in Solomia. If there's something going on, just tell me. I don't want to be kept in the dark."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie looked at the man she loved deeply, took a deep breath, and said, "I... I'm no longer pure... That's why I can't marry you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, two crystal tears rolled down her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser felt as though he had been struck by lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mind went blank, and he stared at Gertie in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Gertie, you must be lying to me, right? You and your cousin, Ada, are known as the two most chaste women in the world of Ancient Martial Art. How could you lose your purity?</span></p><div class="pagination">
