        <h1>Chapter 540 Not Bragging</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund sneered, his voice dripping with mockery. "You little punk, did you hit your head or something? Calling Sync Group's higher-ups? Who do you think you are? What a joke!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina couldn't help but laugh as well, her eyes filled with disdain. "Mr. Cross, just look at him. He's clearly some clueless country bumpkin. There's no way he knows anyone at Sync Group. He's probably just pretending to make a call for show!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words sent Edmund into another round of laughter. "Ridiculous! I've never seen anyone so delusional in my life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd below the stage was equally amused. Whispers and snickers spread quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To them, Marcus looked like someone completely out of his depth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The idea that he could have connections to Sync Group's top brass was absurd. It had to be some pathetic bluff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most figured he was just trying to catch Lila's attention, hoping to impress her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to everyone watching, his attempt was as laughable as it was desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Lila couldn't hide her discomfort. She lightly tapped Marcus' shoulder and leaned in to whisper, "I know you mean well, but this really isn't the way. Don't embarrass yourself. Sync Group's executives aren't people you can just call up like that. You're not... faking this, are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila wasn't one to judge others based on appearances, nor did she look down on people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus' actions left her struggling to believe him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sync Group was a multibillion-dollar powerhouse, and its executives were among the most prestigious figures in the industry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcus truly had those kinds of connections, he wouldn't have been sitting in the audience watching her perform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave her a calm smile. "It doesn't matter who I call, as long as they show up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he casually pulled out his phone and dialed a number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila sighed, rolling her eyes in exasperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't sure whether to appreciate his gesture or laugh at his audacity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this really was all for show, she'd end up embarrassed right along with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, whatever," she thought, resigning herself to the situation. "At this point, what's a little more humiliation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus exchanged a few words on the phone, then ended the call as casually as he'd made it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund and Tina watched him with open disdain, their expressions practically screaming pathetic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina smirked and said mockingly, "Wow, you really put on quite the performance there. So, tell us, who exactly did you call?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With acting skills like that, you're wasting your talent outside the entertainment industry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her comment drew laughter from the security guards on stage, who seemed eager to see Marcus make a fool of himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund stepped closer, a smug grin on his face. "Alright, hotshot. You made your call. Now, when are Sync Group's people getting here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll give you two minutes. If no one shows up, I'll have the guards break your legs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' confident smile didn't falter. "Two minutes? That's too long. They'll be here in one. And if they're not, I'll fire them myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted into laughter, some clutching their sides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To the onlookers, Marcus' bold claims were nothing short of absurd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many began to wonder if he might be a little unhinged. After all, no rational person would say something so wildly out of touch with reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund smirked, crossing his arms. "Alright, one minute it is. Let's see what kind of magic trick you've got up your sleeve."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish his sentence, a commotion broke out near the entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of people was hurrying toward the stage, led by a man in a sharp suit whose air of authority was impossible to miss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd gasped in recognition. It was Dorian Ward, the vice president of Sync Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, is that really Mr. Ward? And he looks... flustered? Could he actually be here because of that guy?" someone murmured in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be ridiculous," another scoffed. "There's no way. Who does he think he is, some big shot?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Ward's here for something else. It's got nothing to do with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most people agreed. There was no way Marcus could command the attention of someone like Dorian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund also noticed Dorian and quickly moved to greet him, plastering a flattering smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Dorian didn't even spare him a glance. Instead, he strode straight past, his expression cold and impatient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the stunned eyes of the entire crowd, Dorian stopped in front of Marcus. "Mr. Fitzgerald," he said respectfully, his tone polite yet tinged with urgency. "We've met before. I wasn't aware you'd be visiting today. Please forgive me for not welcoming you properly."</span></p></div>
