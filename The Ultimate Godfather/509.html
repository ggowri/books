  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir Thurman is in the advanced stages of lung cancer. Fresh air can aid in his recovery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This room is filled with all kinds of noxious gases. Open all the windows and doors immediately to ventilate the space!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus instructed, his voice firm and steady, unfazed by the shocked expressions of the Thurman family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Davey rushed to open the windows, and Kari quickly joined him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Landon's face darkened. He leaned closer to Tom and whispered, "Mr. Zack, do you think this man really knows medicine? How could he possibly get Bowden's breathing to return?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom, equally puzzled, took a deep breath and replied, "Let's wait and see. Right now, I can't quite figure him out, but I'm sure of one thing. He's too young to be some kind of hidden master. He's probably just using some sort of secret method.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Given Sir Thurman's condition, keeping him alive for a few more days is already remarkable. He can't possibly be cured!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Tom's words, Landon relaxed slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Bowden had actually been cured by Marcus, he would have felt utterly embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as Marcus continued to channel his Timeless Numinous Energy, Bowden's breath improved at a visible rate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His breathing steadied, and even his pulse returned to a normal rhythm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The purple and cyan hues that had previously clouded his face began to fade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sight stunned the entire Thurman family once more. Shock and amazement filled their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than half an hour, Marcus had completely stabilized Bowden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Bowden had not yet regained consciousness, all his internal readings had returned to normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, Mom, Uncle Neil... Grandfather's better!" Melina exclaimed in joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words snapped the Thurman family out of their stunned silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neil, still in disbelief, immediately called for the family's doctor, Keith Chavez.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also brought in several medical instruments to perform a full-body scan on Bowden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the examination was completed, Keith nearly dropped the instruments in his hand. His body shook in excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith was one of the country's most renowned oncologists, hired by the Thurman family at great expense to oversee Bowden's treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew all too well how dire Bowden's condition was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bowden's lung cancer was in its final stages, having spread to multiple organs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his advanced age, Bowden's death was almost certain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From Keith's knowledge, even the best oncologists in the world would have been powerless against such an advanced stage of cancer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith had personally conducted a full-body scan just that morning. The cancer had ravaged his organs, leaving them destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, to his utter disbelief, all the cancerous cells had miraculously disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The damaged organs were fully restored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith felt as though he was seeing a ghost, his mind struggling to comprehend what had just happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Professor Chavez, how's my father?" Neil asked urgently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His cancer is gone... completely gone. All of Sir Thurman's organs have healed... it's a miracle, an absolute miracle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith's voice trembled as he grasped Neil's hand. "Can you tell me who the divine healer is who saved Sir Thurman? In my lifetime, I must meet this miracle worker!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Thurman family was once again struck by a wave of disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neil instinctively raised his hand and pointed toward Marcus. "It's him. He's the one who healed my father..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith immediately approached Marcus and, in front of everyone, bowed deeply to him. "Sir, you truly are a divine healer!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, will you accept me as your disciple? If you will, I'll dedicate my entire life to serving you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Thurman family was shaken once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith was a national expert, highly regarded in the field of oncology and held in great esteem in the cancer community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he was asking to become a disciple of this young man. It was simply unbelievable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved his hand dismissively. "I'm no divine healer, and I don't take disciples. Sorry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith's face fell with disappointment, but his eyes still held a deep admiration for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the news of Bowden's miraculous recovery spread, Landon and Tom's expressions turned grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Landon, in particular, glared at Marcus with a cold, piercing gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorcery," Tom muttered under his breath. "This must be sorcery. There's no other explanation for how he could cure such a severe condition."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Thurman family fell silent, and Cloe quickly turned to Tom. "Mr. Zack, what do you mean by 'sorcery'?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom sneered, his voice laced with disdain. "What I'm talking about is sorcery, the kind of evil tricks used to deceive the senses. Sir Thurman might not have actually recovered. What you're seeing could just be an illusion created by this man's sorcery!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the Thurman family heard Tom's explanation, their excitement quickly deflated, replaced by expressions of disbelief and concern.</span></p><div class="pagination">
