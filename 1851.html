  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The starting bid for the yellow Miracle Elixir was set at three thousand Celestial Crystals, with the typical selling price hovering around four to five thousand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasted no time and jumped in with a bold bid of five thousand Celestial Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Kurt, a sly grin on his face. "Mr. Baxter, this is the last Miracle Elixir up for grabs&mdash;the yellow one that enhances the Divine Body. It's incredibly valuable and could be quite useful for you. Aren't you going to place a bid? I'm genuinely interested this time. Why not let's see who's got deeper pockets?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If nothing else, you could help me drive the price up a bit. I wouldn't want to snag this yellow Miracle Elixir too cheaply, now would I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt felt a heavy weight settle in his chest, as if a boulder had dropped right there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at Osborne, speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was caught in a mental tug-of-war. "Does this guy genuinely want the yellow Miracle Elixir, or is he just trying to bait me into spending more Celestial Crystals? Is this another ploy to make me pay an inflated price for something I don't really need?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt was momentarily at a loss for what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Kurt's mind, the white Miracle Elixir had far greater value.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, a single yellow Miracle Elixir offered only limited enhancement to the Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would take a substantial quantity of yellow elixirs to truly break through the limits of one's Divine Body and achieve a significant boost in power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast, the white elixir was worth a life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt was reluctant to spend too much on the yellow Miracle Elixir. If Osborne was indeed just playing games, he'd end up regretting it later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if he didn't respond to the challenge, wouldn't that make him look weak? How would others perceive him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression shifted like the weather, a storm brewing in his eyes as he wrestled with his thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The auctioneer called, "Five thousand Celestial Crystals for the yellow Miracle Elixir! Anyone willing to bid higher?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five thousand Celestial Crystals, going once!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five thousand Celestial Crystals, going twice!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five thousand Celestial Crystals, going three times!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sold!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Kurt remained silent, his apprehension about Osborne's intentions keeping him from bidding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a shame, Mr. Baxter didn't even place a bid. Is it that you've run out of money? With such weak resolve, how could you ever claim you'd buy all the Miracle Elixirs today? That's just laughable! Maybe it's time to keep a lower profile."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne seized the moment to taunt Kurt, pushing him closer to the edge of fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Kurt knew better than to lash out at Osborne here in the Luminous Commerce Center. He forced down his boiling anger and turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're done here! You just wait! You can act all high and mighty now, but I'll be waiting for you outside!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When you come begging for mercy, don't you dare start crying!" Kurt shot back, his eyes blazing with fury as he stormed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne merely shrugged, pretending he hadn't heard a thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Kurt was gone, Osborne collected the Miracle Elixir and made his exit from the auction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't forgotten the real reason he had come here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The map of Celestara awaited him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sales associate remained completely professional as SHE guided Osborne through the intricacies of the map purchases. Neither his extravagant spending at the Miracle Elixir auction nor his confrontation with Kurt seemed to have any impact on the associate's demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With an unwavering enthusiasm, she led him to a shop dedicated to maps. "Sir, the maps you're looking for are right here. We offer three tiers of maps. Once you select one, we'll upload the map information directly to your terminal wristband, making it easy for you to check anytime."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, his curiosity piqued. "What are the three tiers?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The associate explained with excitement, "The first tier features city-state maps. This includes detailed layouts of the major cities in the West Zone. You'll find the locations of every shop and every base of Third-rate Powers marked on the map. Of course, we also have maps of other major cities in Celestara, but they aren't as comprehensive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The second tier expands upon the first by encompassing whole regional maps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take the East Zone, for example. In addition to the ten major cities, you'll also see detailed layouts of smaller towns, as well as information on terrain, bodies of water, natural environments, and areas that might pose dangers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I should warn you, though&mdash;the price jumps significantly with this level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We also offer similar maps for the South Zone, North Zone, and Central Zone, but they aren't as detailed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The third tier is the entire map of Celestara. Essentially, it's a fusion of the five regional maps into one grand overview..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remarked, "Sounds perfect! I'd like to see the third tier map, if possible. "I want to make sure it meets my needs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The associate replied, quickly pulling up the display, "Absolutely! We have a preview map that allows you to take a closer look. Just keep in mind that while this preview offers a general idea, the details&mdash;like terrain features&mdash;won't be accurate. Memorizing them could lead you astray."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, the attendant projected a massive map into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer scale of Celestara was staggering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vastness of the map sprawled before Osborne.</span></p><div class="pagination">
