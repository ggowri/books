  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stashed Angela's Peak Lord Token away and cast a wry smile around at the empty surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At last, he'd gotten his identity token from the Mystic Sirius Sect and officially become an inner disciple at Peak Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Isa, Clarissa, and the others&mdash;where they'd ended up or what had befallen them&mdash;nobody knew, and truth be told, apart from Osborne and Angela, no one seemed to give a hoot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne made himself at home in his new abode halfway up Peak Seven. It was a snug and peaceful dwelling. The view from his courtyard was simply stunning, with a sea of clouds billowing below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A protective barrier encircled the yard, and only his identity token could grant entry, guaranteeing he wouldn't be bothered while he trained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sat cross-legged in the courtyard, gazing out at the clouds, deep in thought about his next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I </span><span>gotta</span><span> figure out a way to get to Nebula City, the capital of the Glorious Divine Kingdom. I should pay my respects to my mom from my past life. But she's buried in the Royal Family's Royal Sepulcher. With my current standing, there's no way I can get in. And trying to sneak in? That'd be a death wish!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gaining entry to the Royal </span><span>Family's</span><span> Royal Sepulcher is no walk in the park!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned as he pondered the matter.</span><br><span>For outsiders, there are only two ways to get in. The first is to become a Royal Family guard in the Glorious Divine Kingdom. You'd have to safeguard a member of the Royal Family when they go into the sepulcher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But becoming a Royal Family guard is a real uphill battle. You've </span><span>gotta</span><span> be incredibly powerful and pass a strict background check. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Even if I started prepping right this second, it could take years before I'd stand a chance.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Scrap that option!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second way to get into the Royal </span><span>Family's</span><span> Royal Sepulcher is a bit more straightforward. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>The Glorious Divine Kingdom holds large-scale sacrificial ceremonies in the sepulcher during major festivals, and that's my golden opportunity! If I could score an invitation, I'd be in.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, to get an invitation, you'd need to be at least the head of a Second-rate Power, like the sect master of the Mystic Sirius Sect...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Right now, that's just a pipe dream for me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Looks like my only shot is to get in as a performer.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every ten years, the Glorious Divine Kingdom holds a national competition&mdash;the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel! And the venue is right in the Royal Sepulcher...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>If I can take part in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, I can get into the Royal Sepulcher and find an opportunity to pay my respects to my mom from my past life!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, Osborne felt a rush of determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He summoned Maddox to ask about the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox paused for a moment, then responded, "Oh, it's </span><span>gonna</span><span> start pretty soon! The cities are already gearing up! The finals will be held in a year!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, "A year from now?! Give me the lowdown!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox nodded, itching to explain, "The Glorious Divine Kingdom is split into ten zones. Each zone's got a hundred states, and every state's home to a hundred cities! Only ten teams can enter the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In other words, each zone can only send one team to Nebula City for the showdown. So, if you </span><span>wanna</span><span> take part, you </span><span>gotta</span><span> first rise above the rest in your sect, then in your city, after that in your state, and finally, dominate your zone to be the top dog.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only then can you make your way to Nebula City and battle it out in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel for the crown of the nation's mightiest!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox sighed, his expression grim, "This is going to be incredibly tough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ten years ago, Mystic Sirius Sect sent our ten strongest disciples to the city duel, but only three made it out of Tempest Fortress City to compete in the state duel, and they all fell flat. As for the zone duel, it's been years since we had anyone from Mystic Sirius Sect participate, let alone the final Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he talked, a hint of ruefulness flickered across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This didn't escape Osborne's notice, and he instinctively knitted his brows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is it really that hard to compete in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his past life, Osborne had been a prince of the Glorious Divine Kingdom. To him, the duel had seemed like a mere spectacle&mdash;he'd just sit back and watch the fighters clash on stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never imagined how difficult it would be to actually stand on that stage himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So, I need to stand out in Mystic Sirius Sect first?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Then represent the sect in the Tempest Fortress City's city duel, do well there, and then move on to the state duel in Zephyr State? Only by excelling in the state duel can I represent Zephyr State in the Eastern Zone 3 zone duel.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>And finally, I'd have to defeat formidable opponents in the Eastern Zone 3 battle to earn my spot in Nebula City for the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a headache coming on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was daunting&mdash;extremely daunting!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it wasn't completely hopeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel was divided into two groups&mdash;one below Empyrean Sacredness and one at the Empyrean Sacredness level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Empyrean Sacredness group? That was out of the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the sect master of the Fairy Moon Sect had competed there. Those warriors were top-tier; a single finger from them could easily take Osborne out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he could set his sights on those below the level of Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Given my current prowess, there are few in that bracket who can beat me! So, this is a real opportunity for me. All I have to do is make a name for myself in the Mystic Sirius Sect first, then stand out in Tempest Fortress City, and after that make waves in Zephyr State, and finally, make a splash in Eastern Zone 3. In a year's time, I'll be fully prepared for the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes blazed with resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This is my one-and-only shot to enter the Royal Sepulcher and pay homage to my mother from my past life! I simply cannot let this chance slip through my fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, Osborne swung around to face Maddox. "How do I go about registering for the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox stared at him, taken aback. "You're really set on taking part?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In just half a month, the Mystic Sirius Sect is hosting its Sect Tournament! This competition is open to those below the Empyrean Sacredness level, and cultivation levels don't come into play. It's designed to pick out the best disciples from the sect to represent us in the city duel in Tempest Fortress City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're aiming for the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, you'll have to land a spot in the top ten of this Sect Tournament. Only then can you represent the Mystic Sirius Sect in the city duel in Tempest Fortress City..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The top ten of the Mystic Sirius Sect?" Osborne's eyes glinted with determination. "Fine! Take me to register!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he'd made up his mind, he didn't waste a moment and went straight to find Earvin, Maddox's teacher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earvin arched an eyebrow, his face clouded with worry. "You want to enter the Sect Tournament?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you certain? You're only at the Ascension Seven. Even if you compete, there's no way you'll achieve a good result. For the past two tournaments, no one from our Peak Seven has managed to make it into the top ten..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a soft chuckle, easily shrugging off the doubt. "I just want to take a crack at it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earvin heaved a sigh and gave in. "All right! If you're not bothered about making a fool of yourself, I won't hold you back. There are still some spots available for Peak Seven, so I'll put your name down. In half a month, you'll be representing us in the Sect Tournament..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that decision made, Earvin had Osborne fill out the registration forms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ball was now rolling, and there was no going back.</span></p><div class="pagination">
