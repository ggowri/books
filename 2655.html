  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Osborne inserted the Violet-blooded Bronze Spear into the hole, the massive Eighth Skyfall Casket immediately trembled violently, and an incredibly terrifying aura burst forth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The lid of The Eighth Skyfall Casket shook wildly, causing the entire Necropolis City to tremble violently. Everyone could see the coffin slowly shifting.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Frederick's face was filled with excitement and exhilaration.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's open!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It&rsquo;s finally open!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had plotted for so many years, all to open The Eighth Skyfall Casket and enter it to gain the power to break through his cultivation level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now, The Eighth Skyfall Casket is finally about to open.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The massive coffin lid gradually shifted amidst the tremors, revealing a small gap. Although it was just a tiny crack, relative to the enormous Skyfall Casket, it was already enough for anyone to pass through.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Terrifying power surged out from the gap.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next moment, Frederick moved. He ignored everyone, dashed straight toward the gap, and disappeared instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick became the first person to enter The Eighth Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With his movement, the others quickly sprang into action as well.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista shot Osborne a fierce glare, a hint of madness and killing intent flashing in her eyes, but ultimately did nothing. Instead, she quickly followed Frederick and rushed into The Eighth Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next were Weston, Quinn, Naomi, and other Royal Family members.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They also cast a hateful glance at Osborne before rushing into the gap without hesitation, entering The Eighth Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next were the Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors from various major factions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They sensed the terrifying power emanating from The Eighth Skyfall Casket. Though filled with worry and fear, seeing Frederick and the Royal Family members rush in without hesitation, they suppressed their terror and instantly followed with Mason, Brenda, and others, fearing they might be too late and miss out on the benefits seized by Frederick and the others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next were over a hundred Royal Family guards.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They also rushed into The Eighth Skyfall Casket without hesitation and disappeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before long, everyone except Osborne, Adriana, May, Clara, Leroy, and Casey slipped through the fissure and entered the Eighth Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the massive coffin lid let out a loud bang, abruptly stopped moving, and the gap ceased to widen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seemed it could only open to this extent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took the Violet-blooded Bronze Spear out of the hole and approached the gap.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He did not rush into the Eighth Skyfall Casket but activated Satan's Eye, attempting to see the interior through the coffin lid's gap.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, he couldn't see anything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's Satan's Eye was completely unable to glimpse inside the Eighth Skyfall Casket; some peculiar force blocked his vision.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, let's hurry in too!" Adriana said, "There must be great benefits inside the Skyfall Casket! Otherwise, Frederick wouldn't be so excited. They've already gone in, and if we're late, they'll take all the benefits."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head after hearing this. "No need to rush! If the benefits in the Skyfall Casket were so easily taken, Frederick wouldn't have allowed us to enter. If it were me, I would eliminate everyone first and then enter the Skyfall Casket alone. Otherwise, if someone else takes the benefits, all the effort would be for nothing."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana nodded upon hearing this, feeling that Osborne made sense. "But the Skyfall Casket is already open, staying here is pointless."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No!" Osborne said gravely, "Frederick mentioned that there are dangers inside the Skyfall Casket. Moreover, everyone will be transported to different places. So inside the Skyfall Casket, we will be separated."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Before entering the Skyfall Casket, we must be prepared!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying this, Osborne began taking out some items.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He first took out a Dimensional Bag and handed it to Adriana. "Ms. Alba, this is for you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana was stunned for a moment upon hearing this, then smiled and said, "What are you doing? I'm the Palace Master of Fairy Moon Sect, I lack nothing. You don't need to give me anything. Keep it for yourself."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly. "Are you sure? I think you'd better take a look inside before deciding."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana still smiled. "What's there to see? Do you really think you can bring out something I don't already have? Unless it's the Violet-blooded Bronze Spear, nothing else interests me. They can't enhance my strength and are meaningless."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she spoke, Adriana had already opened the Dimensional Bag. Her words came to an abrupt halt, and an expression of utter shock appeared on her face, leaving her completely frozen in place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Coming back to her senses, she exclaimed, "How is this possible?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She stared at Osborne in disbelief, then quickly looked at the items in the storage bag, even rubbing her eyes, thinking she had seen it wrong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "This is impossible!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled calmly, "Nothing is impossible! What do you think of these items? Can they enhance your strength?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hiss!" Adriana exclaimed in shock, "Of course! If I can leave a mark on these and fully control them, my strength will increase tenfold, or even more!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, even if I face Frederick head-on, I won't be afraid. Unless he also has something similar, there's no way I could lose to him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana was incredibly excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her reaction instantly left Clara, Leroy, Casey, and the others around her stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They all knew that Osborne must have given Adriana something extremely precious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But they had no idea what exactly could shock Adriana so much.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone was filled with curiosity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana asked, "Osborne, are you really willing to give these to me? Do you know their value? Do you know how much of a stir these treasures would cause if exposed on Racial Convergence Planet?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana still couldn't calm herself at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile. "Of course, I know. But to me, it's nothing. I hope to exchange them for the Crystal Armor you have."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Adriana was stunned for a moment, then without hesitation, she took off the Crystal Armor she was wearing and quickly erased her mark from it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "This Crystal Armor now belongs to you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne happily took the Crystal Armor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The others were shocked, curious about what Osborne had given Adriana to make her hand over the Crystal Armor without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was the top-tier Supreme Sacred Artifact!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Its value was immeasurable!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, even May looked at Adriana in surprise. "Ms. Alba, what's wrong with you? The Crystal Armor on you is the strongest battle armor of the Fairy Moon Sect! How could you give it away?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana said calmly, "The Crystal Armor was indeed the strongest battle armor of the Fairy Moon Sect before. But from now on, it no longer is!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, she took out a set of Panoply Armor from the Dimensional Bag.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a set of low-grade Imperial Artifact Panoply Armor.</span></p><div class="pagination">
