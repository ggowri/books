  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is happening?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence stood frozen, staring down into the depths of the chasm where a massive crimson lotus shimmered, radiating Osborne's unmistakable energy signature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sense of foreboding twisted in his gut, and his brow furrowed in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spectators, noticing the shift in his demeanor, exchanged uneasy glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's going on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Osborne really die, or is he still hanging in there?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the crimson lotus hidden deep within the chasm, only Lord Malevolence could see it, leaving the others to speculate wildly about Osborne's fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could Lord Malevolence's frown mean that Osborne is still alive?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he actually block that overwhelming attack?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anticipation surged among the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Isa could no longer contain her curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She dashed to the edge of the pit, peering into the abyss below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the Sanctum of Night followed, with Clarissa, Anastasia, and others joining her to gaze into the chasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What they saw took their breath away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They also sensed Osborne's energy signature from the lotus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crimson lotus had an unparalleled vitality, swaying gently in the depths, perfectly unharmed by Lord Malevolence's terrifying Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the tension broke, and Isa couldn't help but smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's face lit up with joy, as did Anastasia and the rest of the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, to everyone's astonishment, the crimson lotus began to transform before their eyes. In an incredible display, it morphed into Osborne's figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lifted his gaze toward Lord Malevolence, a smirk on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Osborne had been struck by the force of the Sacred Power, he had transformed into his second form&mdash;the crimson lotus&mdash;unleashing his absolute defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Lord Malevolence's attack was ferocious, renowned for being insurmountable to anyone below Empyrean Sacredness, it proved ineffective against Osborne's formidable barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, far from being obliterated by the attack, Osborne didn't even suffer a scratch. It was true that he had expended a great deal of power to activate his absolute defense. But with the Chaotic Spiritual Root within him, the depleted power was restored in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne remained at the peak of his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't believe this..." Lord Malevolence watched in disbelief as the crimson lotus transformed back into Osborne, who stood there unscathed, with his energy signature still at its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was completely stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, it was as if he had lost all his strength, and his face went blank with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! This can't be real!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Empyrean Sacredness warrior who sold me the Sacred Dragon Clan horns said that the Sacred Power generated by fusing two dragon horns would be nearly impossible for even someone who just breaks through to Empyrean Sacredness, to withstand! No one below that level could possibly block such an attack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could you survive?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this even possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched Lord Malevolence's unraveling composure, amusement dancing in his eyes. "Maybe you were just misled? Perhaps the horns from the Sacred Dragon Clan weren't as powerful as you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's impossible! The horns' strength has been proven countless times across the cosmos!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged, a grin on his face. "Could it be that you got stuck with a counterfeit? If not, why am I standing here without a scratch on me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence felt an icy dread wash over him. "Impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was once a disciple of a major sect in Racial Convergence Planet. I'm no fool! How could I not recognize the horns of the Sacred Dragon Clan? I've seen enough to know the difference between the genuine and the fake!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression morphed into a snarl as he demanded, "What kind of trickery did you use? How did you block my attack?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged. "Want to know? I'll tell you after you're dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne soared out of the pit, his presence filling the battlefield like a bolt of lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, the air erupted into chaos&mdash;a cacophony of shouts and cries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the ranks of the Dark Deity Legion, despair settled in, leaving some soldiers wailing in hopelessness. Meanwhile, the Human Alliance burst into cheers, their voices rising in celebration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was alive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was not only alive, but he also appeared to be entirely unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears streamed down the faces of many in the Human Alliance, tears born of relief and joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victory was within reach, tipping the scales decidedly in their favor for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence had unleashed his ultimate secret weapon, yet Osborne had withstood it without a scratch. Now, the Lord Malevolence was visibly drained&mdash;his once-majestic dragon horns dulled and cracked, a testament to his exhaustion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What followed was bound to be Osborne's counterattack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He floated gracefully in front of Lord Malevolence, who was now weakened and desperate. Seeing his feeble posture, Osborne couldn't suppress a smile. His confidence soared to new heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lord Malevolence, it's over! You've lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words ignited an inferno of rage within Lord Malevolence. "Lost? Impossible! I will </span><span>never</span><span> lose to you! Celestara Planet is just a speck of dust in the cosmos and a backwater </span><span>there</span><span>! Here, how could anyone possibly defeat me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I refuse to lose! I'm not beaten yet! No one here can topple me, especially not you! I will emerge as the ultimate victor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a roar, he unleashed another surge of dark energy, swirling around Osborne like a tempest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne merely chuckled, shaking his head. "What a futile struggle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"While you've been on the offense, it's my turn now! I wonder if you can withstand my assault?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne drew his Bloodwrought Bow, swiftly pulling back the string as Sacred Power surged forth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A brilliant arrow appeared, gleaming with potential and purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Release!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrow shot through the air like a comet, smashing through Lord Malevolence's dark energy, and racing toward its target. Lord Malevolence gritted his teeth, pouring every ounce of strength he had left into a desperate defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impossible! You can't defeat me! I am invincible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will win! I HAVE to win!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Malevolence Empire will rise again on this planet! The Human Community will be enslaved, and I refuse to be defeated!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground shook as Lord Malevolence struggled against the arrow's power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the Sacred Power arrow exploded in a violent clash of energies, it took a toll on Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood rushed to his face, and he trembled, his strength waning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could catch his breath, three more arrows</span><span> </span><span>materialized </span><span>on </span><span>Osborne's Bloodwrought Bow, each one drawn with lethal intention. "Here's another round!" Osborne declared confidently, letting them fly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Lord Malevolence raised his hands to defend, even at his most exhausted, he managed to fend off the three arrows&mdash;but not without incredible cost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hands were torn and bloodied, his body quaking with the effort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that critical moment, Osborne readied his bow once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, a total of ten arrows glistened on the string, poised for release.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair flashed across Lord Malevolence's eyes as he realized the gravity of his situation.</span></p><div class="pagination">
