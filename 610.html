  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett stood at the high altitude, his face cold and stern as he glared at Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sebastian, why do you protect that kid? You can't keep him safe even if he's your son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Blaspheming the gods will bring the wrath of the League of Divine Descent. Your attempts to shield him will doom your Augustine family and yourself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't have a chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather merely smiled, "Everett, possessing light elemental power isn't wrong. He hasn't blasphemed against the gods. It's best you stay out of this, or you'll regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett laughed. "Regret? That's a joke. Whether he blasphemed is for the League of Divine Descent to decide, not you or anyone else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? Not even if I say it?" A cold woman's voice cut in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett was stunned. The voice was not from Godfather but from a woman. He couldn't help but be surprised and looked in the direction of the voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to see a tall figure standing effortlessly in the sky just one hundred yards away, but he had no idea how this woman got so close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face changed, and he finally saw the woman's face clearly and was immediately shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman smiled and slowly approached him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does it not count when I say he didn't blaspheme the gods? You're Everett, the patriarch of the Rosenthal family, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman had now walked up to Everett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett nodded, trembling. "You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman slapped him hard across the face. Caught off guard, he didn't dare avoid it and even turned his other cheek to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Night, what brings you here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I'm Everett. Your memory serves you well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the slap, he forced a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman was disgusted by the way he looked and slapped him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have a good memory. I don't need your reminders. By the way, I gave Osborne light elemental essence. I heard you want to execute Osborne to the Mount of Gods for supposed blasphemy?" she said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa stared at Everett with a dangerous light in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett was terrified. "I didn't know you gave him the light elemental essence! I wouldn't have targeted him. It's all my fault."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With both cheeks swollen, he maintained a panicked smile, desperately glancing at Godfather for support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather, however, was indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have the nerve to look at him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's fury grew as she kicked Everett away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt pain all over his body, then quickly scrambled back to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Night, I see my mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I truly didn't know you gave him the Light elemental essence. I'll atone. Whatever you ask me to do, I will definitely do it according to your instructions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his submission, Isa calmed slightly. "Tell your League of Divine Descent that the light elemental power is now open to all, and everyone has the right to possess it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cancel the agreement you made decades ago!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett hesitated, but the change in her expression urged him to comply. "No problem! I'll relay this. I'm sure they won't object."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smirked. "I know you'll feel resentment, and I'm unconcerned. If you want revenge, go ahead! As for Osborne, if you're upset with him, you can also deal with him! But the premise is, you old guys better do nothing! If any of you old fellows try to harm him, I'll show you what cruelty means.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood! We won't act against him!" Everett hurriedly promised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good," she replied, glancing at Godfather. "Old man, you nearly ruined my plan. Thankfully, he kept my identity safe. Otherwise, you would have faced my wrath too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Godfather's body suddenly stiffened and tensed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled bitterly and said, "You can't beat me up. I'm his grandfather."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa paused, her cheeks slightly reddening, but she stiffly replied, "I don't care. Just make him recognize you first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave, she vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Godfather relaxed, he looked at Everett's swollen face and smiled, "I warned you, but you didn't listen."</span></p><div class="pagination">
