  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Clarissa, you look exhausted. Come here. Take Clarissa back to her room to rest. I&rsquo;ll take care of the guests,&rdquo; Donna said sternly as several female bodyguards stepped forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa immediately became anxious, and her face turned pale. &ldquo;Aunt Donna, you can&rsquo;t do this.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Unfortunately, her protests were in vain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The female bodyguards took Clarissa away by force, holding her arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Witnessing this scene, Osborne felt speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Even someone like Clarissa can sometimes feel trapped</span><span style="font-style: italic;">,</span> he thought. <span style="font-style: italic;">The control she faces is stricter than most people, with no allowances for emotions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">While everyone sees her beauty, her privileged status, and her perfect cold facade, no one realizes she doesn&rsquo;t even have the right to decide who her friends are.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No wonder she started running away from home at the age of five.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that moment, Osborne suddenly felt a pang of pity for Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Clarissa was taken away, Donna turned her gaze back to Osborne, her calm face now tinged with authority.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Now, Mr. Augustine, we can continue our previous discussion. What do you think of my proposal? If you agree, I can assure you that you will soon become a prominent figure in Mayby City, even establishing a new prominent family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;We, the Radcliffe family, have the capability. Do you want me to propose a plan, or do you have a request in mind?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia and Wesley were consumed with jealousy. Ophelia thought, <span style="font-style: italic;">If only I had known that Osborne was Clarissa&rsquo;s savior, I would never have agreed to divorce him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">To propose a request to the Radcliffe family?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">To gain their support? It&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve always dreamed of.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And now, Osborne effortlessly achieved it!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Both of them were certain that Osborne would agree. No one would pass up such an opportunity. With the support of the Radcliffe family, who in Mayby City would dare to offend Osborne?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Regardless of Osborne&rsquo;s previous status, he would become a top figure in Mayby City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even they would have to flatter him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">No one believed Osborne would refuse, and Donna shared the same sentiment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But at that moment, Osborne raised his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Calmly, he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but I may not be able to accept your proposal.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After he spoke, everyone was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne, of course, couldn&rsquo;t agree. Even though he was tempted, accepting Donna&rsquo;s offer would mean he couldn&rsquo;t see Clarissa anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This conflicted with his second test.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Unable to pass the test, he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to become the Godfather&rsquo;s successor, losing more than he gained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne wasn&rsquo;t foolish. He wouldn&rsquo;t sacrifice a greater opportunity for a smaller one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, in Ophelia and Wesley&rsquo;s eyes, Osborne&rsquo;s choice was beyond foolish.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They stared at him, dumbfounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Idiot!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley suddenly felt a sense of schadenfreude. Looking at Donna&rsquo;s cold expression, he thought Osborne was in for a rough time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He thought, <span style="font-style: italic;">A commoner is just a commoner. He could ruin such a great opportunity, making the worst choice! More foolish than a pig</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia shook her head as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had thought Osborne&rsquo;s fate was about to change, even starting to regret divorcing him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Osborne made the worst choice, further causing her disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She thought, <span style="font-style: italic;">Indeed, a useless commoner will never rise above his luck. Given an opportunity, he&rsquo;s still useless, truly hopeless</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia was disappointed and once again felt that divorce was the right thing to do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that moment, Donna&rsquo;s face turned extremely cold and stern, her gaze piercing as she looked at Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Young man, you can&rsquo;t be too greedy in life. Some things are just not meant for you to have. Trying to force your way in will only hurt yourself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Think it over some more, then come back with your answer when you&rsquo;re ready.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna&rsquo;s voice was filled with coldness and threat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne wore a wry smile, knowing that Donna misunderstood he was one of Clarissa&rsquo;s suitors, yet he couldn&rsquo;t explain himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Calmly shaking his head, he replied, &ldquo;No need to think about it. I won&rsquo;t agree to your proposal because I don&rsquo;t see this as a transaction. I don&rsquo;t want to trade the act of saving Ms. Radcliffe for any benefits, nor do I want to lose anything in the process.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna&rsquo;s expression turned even colder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Young man, do you realize what you&rsquo;re missing out on by making this choice? The friendship and support of the Radcliffe family are not something just anyone can obtain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t believe me, ask them both. If my proposal were given to them, even if it meant abandoning their families, they wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate for a moment.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley and Ophelia looked embarrassed upon hearing this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, they didn&rsquo;t argue back, partly out of fear and partly because Donna was right.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If Osborne&rsquo;s opportunity was given to them, they would definitely be willing to give up a lot. They knew that with the support of the Radcliffe family, they could soar to great heights, reclaiming everything they had lost twofold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne, on the other hand, simply smiled, &ldquo;They may be willing to abandon their families for this, but I don&rsquo;t even want to lose a single hair. So, I&rsquo;m not like them.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna snorted coldly, saying, &ldquo;Indeed, you&rsquo;re not like them. They are smart people, and you&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You are more foolish than them!&rdquo;</p><div class="pagination">
