  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm barked, "Hand over all your tokens, now! And don't even think about making a run for it! You haven't got a snowball's chance in hell of getting away from us. And forget about registering those tokens now. Too late. We won't give you the chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those tokens, worth 100 thousand points, whether they were meant for someone else or not, now belong to Mr. Maurice!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Malcolm sized Clara up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not because he was checking her out&mdash;after all, their every move was being broadcast across Frost Peak City, visible to everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he had balls of steel, he wouldn't dare try anything here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, there were referees around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm sized Clara up because she suddenly looked familiar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, Mr. Maurice! This woman looks like Osborne's teammate! No wonder she rings a bell. Haha, she's one of Osborne's crew!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Conrad took a good look at Clara, then let out a cold laugh. "So, you're one of that good-for-nothing Osborne's team members. So, these tokens were actually meant for Osborne? You haven't registered them because you haven't found him, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha! That useless Osborne is long dead on the sixth layer. He probably kicked the bucket three days ago... And here you've been holding onto these tokens, waiting like a fool for him to come back so you could hand them over and help him climb the ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha, but in the end, it's me who's going to cash in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Conrad waved his hand and ordered, "Enough screwing around. Beat her and grab all the tokens she's got!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll handle it!" Malcolm smirked. "This </span><span>chick's</span><span> only ranked </span><span>two hundred and ninety-nine</span><span> on the strength leaderboard. She's no match for us. I can take her down with one hand tied behind my back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You guys just hang back and watch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Malcolm gripped his Sacred Artifact and strode towards Clara. "Hey, bitch. You </span><span>gonna</span><span> hand them over willingly, or do I have to beat the crap out of you and take them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Clara said, "If you want these tokens, you'll have to pry them from my cold, dead hands. You think I'm just going to hand them over? Dream on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, a dark iron chain appeared in her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm scoffed, eyeing the chain in Clara's hand with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha, a quasi-Sacred Artifact? You don't even have a real Sacred Artifact and you're trying to act tough in front of me? That's hilarious! I'll take you down in one move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Malcolm suddenly launched his attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He unleashed a powerful surge of Sacred Power, channeling it into his Sacred Artifact. A terrifying wave of energy instantly threatened to engulf Clara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Clara remained calm and fearless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a deep breath and prepared to strike back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black chain in her hand shot towards Malcolm with lightning speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could even react, he was completely ensnared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm's face turned ashen. He immediately tried to break free, unleashing his Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to his utter horror, he couldn't budge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How the hell is this happening?!" Malcolm's face darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was ranked eightieth on the strength leaderboard, while Clara was </span><span>two hundred and ninety-nine</span><span>. Their strength levels were worlds apart. He expected to crush her like a bug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was what Malcolm thought would happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in this real-time showdown, Malcolm was shocked to find that Clara had managed to bind him with just a quasi-Sacred Artifact chain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how hard he struggled, he couldn't break free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To everyone's surprise, Clara dodged his attack with astonishing speed. In the blink of an eye, she was dashing towards him, her palm crackling with powerful Sacred Power as she aimed a strike at his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm's face drained of all color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trapped by the binding chains, he had nowhere to run.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Clara's attack landed, he was toast. Even if he didn't die, he'd be seriously screwed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that desperate moment, all thoughts of pride went out the window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm let out a panicked shout. "Help me! This woman's got some freaky tricks up her sleeve! Her quasi-Sacred Artifact chains have got me tied up good! I can't break free! Hurry up and save my ass!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm's desperate cries left Conrad and the others utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of them had expected Malcolm to be outmatched by Clara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conrad scoffed and said, "This woman's a slippery fish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, I'll step in myself and take care of her. Can't afford any more surprises."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Conrad vanished and reappeared in front of Malcolm. A haughty smirk appeared on his face as he raised his hand and met Clara's oncoming strike head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact sent shockwaves through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conrad barely flinched, while Clara was sent flying. She spat out a mouthful of blood and crashed into the thick glacier like a rag doll, leaving a massive crater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood trickled from the corner of her mouth as she glared at Conrad, her eyes filled with frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conrad was a beast, ranking fifteenth on the power list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way Clara could take him on, especially with her bare hands against his Sacred Artifact gloves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that she'd even managed to make Conrad stumble was a feat in itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the gap in their strength was just too wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara coughed up another mouthful of blood, her eyes blazing with fury as she stared down Conrad and his gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grab all her tokens," Conrad commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You got it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm, finally freed from the chains thanks to Conrad, glared at Clara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was absolutely livid. If it weren't for Conrad's timely intervention, he would have been the one eating dirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was a hard pill to swallow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nice moves, bitch. Too bad they won't save you. Now, those tokens of yours are ours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm waved his hand, and a shower of tokens flew out of Clara's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were over a hundred, including seventy-two tokens from the fourth layer and two hundred and twenty-five from the third.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Converted into points, that was a whopping 945 hundred, almost 100 thousand!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These tokens were supposed to be for Osborne, but now they were Conrad's spoils of war.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara's eyes turned red with rage, but she was powerless to stop them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was no match for Conrad, let alone their whole team. Defeated, she could only watch helplessly as they claimed her hard-earned tokens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conrad was ecstatic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly pressed the tokens against his nameplate to register them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His state </span><span>duel</span><span> points skyrocketed nearly 100 thousand, from 1.08 million to over 1.17 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His ranking on the points list jumped from ninth to eighth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conrad let out a triumphant "Hahaha!" and sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Blame it on being Osborne's teammate, woman. If you're not happy, come at me anytime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's roll, fellows!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he arrogantly led his team away, leaving Clara seething with anger and helplessness.</span></p><div class="pagination">
