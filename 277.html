  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the majestic voice echoed through the air, a brilliant flash of light burst into Osborne's vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, an ancient sword light materialized before Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sword light moved with such speed that even with his Satan's Eye activated, he couldn't trace its path. It appeared above Medusa and Venom Lord in the blink of an eye, then came to an abrupt halt as if suspended in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to Osborne's horror, Medusa and Venom Lord were both frozen in place. It was as if a colossal mountain had been dropped upon them, their bodies quivering under the immense pressure, being crushed to the ground slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa's once beautiful face was contorted in agony. Desperately, she shot dazzling beams of light from her eyes towards the sword light above, but it was to no avail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, blood trickled from Medusa's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a scream of pain, she collapsed to the ground, immobilized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Venom Lord fared even worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His robust body exploded the moment the pressure became too much to bear, flesh and blood splattering in all directions. It would take a hundred forensic doctors to piece together a complete body from the remains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mouth hung open in shock, as did Clarissa's, her face full of disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both stared intently at the sword light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What exactly was that? Who could it be?" Clarissa murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew who had arrived. He turned sharply to a figure in the distance, an older woman leaning on a cane, slowly making her way towards them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was Serena, the head of the Draco Group in </span><span>Skyefall</span><span>, Godfather's maid from his youth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was Serena, the super-strong master who had become a master decades ago!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Hernandez!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa also recognized Serena and immediately bowed respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne followed suit quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Hernandez, you've finally arrived!" Osborne felt a wave of relief wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the moment Medusa appeared, he had sensed an extreme danger. Without hesitation, he had contacted Serena through the Draco Star Wristlet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't bear the thought of anything happening to Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Serena had arrived just in time. If not, he would have had to watch helplessly as Medusa and Venom Lord escaped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena nodded slightly to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rose Castle is a property of the Draco Group. I reside here usually. These ruffians dared to cause trouble here. They were practically asking for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she approached Medusa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a simple gesture, the sword light that had been pinning Medusa down appeared in her hand, merging seamlessly with her seemingly ordinary cane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Osborne realize that the cane was, in fact, a uniquely shaped scabbard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Freed from the sword light's suppression, Medusa finally moved, sitting up with bloodied eyes that seemed to have been blinded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She faced Serena's direction, her face devoid of emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's quite unexpected to encounter Ms. Hernandez here! My luck is really terrible! Ms. Hernandez, your sword has even injured the great King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Medusa's face took on a look of despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Defeat at the hands of Ms. Hernandez, I accept with humility! Ms. Hernandez, please do as you wish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was utterly shocked by her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Serena was strong, having been Godfather's maid, but her power exceeded his imagination. Medusa was a Class A master! Yet, in front of Serena, she was utterly defenseless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena had even injured the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena gazed at Medusa indifferently. "No need for flattery! I was able to harm the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> only because he was severely weakened by Godfather, and I just got lucky. Under normal circumstances, the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> could kill me with ease."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa said nothing, her face showing a trace of pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know it well! The great King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> is invincible. His previous defeat at the hands of Godfather was merely a trial he had to endure in his transformation process!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Soon, the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> will return to </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>! When that time comes, everyone connected to Godfather will die. No one will be spared! Everyone will die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa laughed maniacally, her face filled with fanaticism, insane worship for the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena's face turned a little angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She snorted coldly, "How arrogant! If the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> dares to return to </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>, Godfather will defeat him once again! As for you, you're nothing but a pitiful worm who absorbed a trace of Medusa's bloodline. Since you wish to die, I shall oblige you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Serena lightly tapped her cane on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cane touched the ground, but Medusa's body exploded like a watermelon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was once again dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Class A metahuman master had just died like this. It was terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, Osborne thought his strength was quite good. Below the master level, he </span><span>feared no one. Even against a master, he might not be unable to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he realized how naive he had been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought he had seen the true face of the world, but now he knew he had only seen the tip of the iceberg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the shadows, there were far too many terrifying masters!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was still too weak!</span></p><div class="pagination">
