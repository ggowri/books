  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood there, utterly dumbfounded, but he quickly averted his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He barked, his voice firm, "Put your clothes back on!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Emma, you don't need to do this! You'll find someone who's right for you; you're just being impulsive right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma smiled faintly at his words. "Impulsive? I'll admit, I am being a bit reckless! But in twenty-five years, I've never felt this way about any man, only you. I know what that means.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa told me that I don't understand how to love someone, which is why you won't love me back. Maybe she's right; I don't know how to love. But I can show my love through my actions!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Emma wrapped her arms around Osborne from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body pressed against him, and she murmured, "I'm not asking you to love me like you love Clarissa. I just want one unreserved release! If, after that, if I still don't know how to love someone, I'll forget everything and never bother you again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback, his mind racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Does Clarissa know about this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Does she know what Emma's asking for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He furrowed his brow and broke free from Emma's embrace, carefully draping her clothes back over her shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said earnestly, "No! This isn't happening!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Emma, you're a wonderful girl. I know how much courage it takes to do this, but I still can't agree. I owe you a debt of gratitude, and I'll find a way to repay it, but not like this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's eyes glistened with unshed tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice rose slightly as she clenched her fists. "So you still think I'm not good enough for you? You really believe I'm beneath you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, that's not it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then why, when I'm laying it all out there, are you still turning me down? Why push me away?" Emma's frustration boiled over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine! If you don't help me, I'll just find some random guy! I'll find a homeless man and let him do whatever he wants with my body! I'm determined to unlock Satan's Eye today, and if you don't help, I'll go to whoever I can!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll find a junkie, the worst scumbag out there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is all your fault!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Emma spun on her heel, fury etched across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned, quickly stepping in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Emma, stop! Why are you doing this? You're already strong enough! Your talent is top-notch. Even without Satan's Eye, you shine bright!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Until you find the man you truly like, you can wait! Not unlocking Satan's Eye isn't the end of the world; you can't just throw your body away like that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma retorted coldly, "I've already found the man I like! But he doesn't like me back. If I can't have him, I'll do whatever I want with my body. You have no say in this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Move aside!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression was icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's brow furrowed deeply. "No! I won't let you go until you calm down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma scoffed at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? You think you can stop me? Don't forget, you're still Class AA, while I've just broken through to Class AAA! You know what? If you don't help me, then I'll just take what I want!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, if you all say I don't know how to love, then taking what I want by force makes perfect sense, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Emma licked her lips, and Osborne's instincts screamed that something was about to go horribly wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could react, Emma made her move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Freeze!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma unleashed her power, freezing Osborne in place instantly. The chilling force of her Freeze ability rendered his body immobile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne remained calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Emma's freezing power was formidable, it was no match for Duke Medusa's ultimate move, Ashes of Death. Even when Medusa's petrification had ensnared him, Osborne had been able to break free using his martial art aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's Freeze, while powerful, couldn't hold him back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's martial art aura flared to life, causing the ice around him to shatter, freeing him from the grip of Emma's power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma huffed in frustration, "I don't believe it! Even as a Class AAA, I'm still not a match for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Psychic Blast!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of powerful mental strength surged into Osborne's mind. Unfortunately for Emma, Osborne had consumed vast amounts of star power, making his soul incredibly strong and his mental fortitude far superior to that of most psychic metahumans at his level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's psychic assault had no effect on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne urged, "Emma, calm down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't force this. Besides, you can't win."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's face twisted with anger. "I refuse to believe that! Today, I'm going to beat you and force you to help me unlock Satan's Eye!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Emma launched into a frenzied attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her strength was overwhelming; after breaking through to Class AAA, her power had become extraordinarily robust. Osborne found himself struggling to keep up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, seeing she couldn't overpower him, Emma's frustration peaked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you're leaving me no choice!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Death's Stare!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma unleashed her ultimate technique, and Osborne instantly felt a surge of danger.</span></p><div class="pagination">
