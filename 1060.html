  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the gates of the Augustine Estate, tens of thousands of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' Human Slaves and clones stood in eerie silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't even attempt to surround the Augustine Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They seemed utterly unconcerned about any potential escape routes. It was as if they were simply waiting, playing a psychological game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greyson murmured, "Are they trying to mess with our heads?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leaving us a way out, making us think we could still run? It's like they want us to crack before the fight even starts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson frowned, sensing the same unease but knowing it was more complicated than that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He scanned the other 3 directions, his instincts telling him that there were more lurking in the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Send the word out. Get everyone ready for battle!" Wesson commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> might not have launched an attack yet, but they couldn't afford to let their guard down. With both sides numbering nearly 50 thousand, all Class A and above, the destruction of battle would be devastating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fight would lead to catastrophic losses in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze fell upon a distinct group in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearly five thousand members clad in blood-red combat suits stood there, their expressions grim. Each held a uniquely designed energy gun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were not just any fighters&mdash;they were Class AAA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon members!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The front line consisted of one hundred elite Blood Demon Vanguard members, their crimson uniforms adorned with golden and silver threads, each embroidered with a sharp dagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they, too, were Class AAA, their aura was undeniably stronger than the rest. Even Wesson felt a shiver of fear in their presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were equipped with the finest armor, each wielding a divine artifact alongside a more extravagant energy gun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those were super energy guns, hastily delivered from the Weapons Research Institute just the night before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson felt a flicker of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank goodness we still got them!" Wesson thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he couldn't shake the feeling that even their strength might not be enough to hold off the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' forces stirred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The massive army, nearly 50 thousand strong, suddenly saluted in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All hail the King!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All hail the Master!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The booming shouts sent a chill through those at the Augustine Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a figure emerged from the throng&mdash;Gerardo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He strode forward, and every clone and Human Slave gazed at him with fervent admiration and zeal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if they would gladly lay down their lives at his command; even the Class S clones wore the same expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo approached the gate with a subtle smile and raised his gaze to meet Wesson and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, well, if it isn't Wesson. Where are Sebastian and Osborne? You're not worthy of a conversation with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson's face darkened, silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo arched an eyebrow, feigning curiosity. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the matter? Can't they come out to play? I hear Sebastian's in pretty bad shape. Did his injuries worsen? And Osborne... he's not still missing, is he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each word, Wesson's expression grew grimmer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo noticed the look on Wesson's face and knew his assumptions were right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flicker of surprise crossed his features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned, "Sebastian's not here? I expected that. After all, I was the one who defeated him. And now he's in a coma after detonating that divine artifact to save Osborne. That makes perfect sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne, too?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did whoever rescued him not bother to bring him back?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hmph! I actually worried for a moment and even went through the trouble of merging with a second divine corpse!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turns out, there was nothing to worry about! But hey, the merger went well enough; my power's even stronger now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With both Sebastian and Osborne out of the picture, I won't waste any more time here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one can stop me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Gerardo fixed a cold, penetrating gaze on Wesson and the leaders of the other major factions standing beside him, their faces betraying a shared intent to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo declared, "You all are going to die today! This is the price you pay for helping Sebastian against me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You will all die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not a single one of you can escape!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo raised his hand high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All Hyenas and Human Slaves, heed my command! Charge forward!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Annihilate them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' army surged forward like a tidal wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
