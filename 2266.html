  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mystic Sirius Sect's Osborne takes on Mystic Sirius Sect's Bethan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mystic Sirius Sect's Osborne goes up against Fantasia Isle's Omer Antic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mystic Sirius Sect's Osborne faces off against Mystic Sirius Sect's Jamar!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the second day of the battles kicked off, it quickly became apparent that Osborne's opponents were either throwing in the towel right away, like Bethan and Jamar, or getting quickly shot down by his arrows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of the five challengers he faced that day had what it took to put up a real fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned in puzzlement.</span><br><span>How come I haven't run into any tough competition yet? Leroy, Marreese, and Pero&mdash;those were the heavy-hitters, but </span><span>I</span><span> </span><span>haven't come across any of them today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After ten battles, he'd emerged victorious every single time. But now, all five of his remaining opponents were from Azure Haven Academy, and they just so happened to be the top five disciples.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This seems a bit too fishy," he mumbled to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bethan leaned in closer and dropped her voice to a whisper. "Osborne, I reckon Azure Haven Academy's got it in for you! Take a look at today's matchups. It's obvious they've been fixed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne arched an eyebrow, his curiosity piqued. "Fixed? What's their angle?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bethan let out a derisive scoff. "It's a no-brainer! You put down ten thousand Sacred Crystals on yourself to win the whole shebang. If you actually manage to do it, the casino's </span><span>gonna</span><span> have to fork over a staggering 1.3 million Sacred Crystals! That's a fortune they're not keen on losing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And let's not forget, the casino's got Azure Haven Academy in its corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since they're pulling the strings behind the city duel, they'll stop at nothing to keep you from taking the crown. The weaklings you faced today? They're just saving the heavyweights for tomorrow, banking on wearing you out so Marreese or Leroy can knock you off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Azure Haven Academy is really pulling these sneaky stunts. It's a dead giveaway that they recognize </span><span>your</span><span> might."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bethan's words hit the nail on the head, and Osborne's eyes popped open in realization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So that's the game they're playing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But rather than feeling worried, a smirk crept onto his face. They thought they could drain his energy? They had picked the wrong person to mess with! It didn't matter if his next five opponents were just Quasi Empyrean Sacredness fighters; even facing true Empyrean Sacredness opponents wouldn't faze him. After all, with his Chaotic Spiritual Root, energy depletion was the least of his worries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glanced at the leaderboard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With not too many strong matchups today, Leroy and Marreese still boasted perfect records. Leroy </span><span>recorded</span><span> ten wins and zero losses, having already finished </span><span>her</span><span> </span><span>battles, tying </span><span>her</span><span> </span><span>with Osborne for the top spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marreese was close behind with nine wins and no losses, but he still had one more match to go, currently sitting in third.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then there was Clara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had only lost to Osborne, boasting a record of eight wins and one loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Notably, she had previously faced Tyson, who had barely put up a fight before she easily defeated him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara was ranked fourth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson, on the flip side, had lost to Osborne, Clara, and Leroy, ending up with a record of seven wins and three losses, which put him in fifth place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, the top five were Leroy, Osborne, Marreese, Clara, and Tyson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bethan and Jamar were holding their ground at eighth and eleventh respectively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bethan seemed pretty much a shoo-in for the top ten, but Jamar was on thin ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still had a shot, though. Two of the contenders vying for the top ten spots were also disciples from Azure Haven Academy&mdash;Osborne's opponents for tomorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne could take them out and Jamar stepped up his game, he could easily sneak into the top ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next up&mdash;Azure Haven Academy's Marreese takes on Fantasia Isle's Clara!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the referee made the announcement, the crowd went wild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the clash everyone had been itching to see.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, having wrapped up his own bouts, stuck around out of sheer curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment had finally arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marreese strutted onto the stage with a steely look on his face. He tightened his grip on his massive battle blade and locked eyes with Clara, who was unnervingly calm. The fighting spirit burned bright within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So far, he'd sliced through every opponent with just one swing of his blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "So, Clara, you actually managed to beat Tyson! Not too shabby. He might not be the top-dog, but if you can take him down, you're definitely someone to reckon with."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He flashed an arrogant grin. "I sure hope you can withstand a few of my blows!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quit the blabber! Let's get this over with!" Clara </span><span>retorted,</span><span> her voice as cold as ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright then!" Marreese didn't waste a second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hoisted his enormous blade high into the air. A dazzling light burst forth from it, and then he brought it down on Clara with every ounce of his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the very same move that had flattened all his previous opponents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His blade crackled with a fierce energy that zeroed in on Clara with deadly accuracy. No matter how nimble his foes were, they always ended up in the path of his strike, their defenses crumbling under his overpowering might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, Marreese was in for a rude awakening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, Clara's iron chains sprang to life, twisting and swirling above her head before positioning themselves in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marreese's blade came crashing down, the chains absorbed the blow, vibrating violently as they shattered the energy of his strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marreese's expression shifted, shock flickering across his face. "Let's go again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He unleashed a flurry of strikes, each one more terrifying than the last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer force of his attacks sent shivers through the crowd, enough to intimidate anyone below Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Clara remained unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under her control, the quasi-Sacred Artifact chains acted like a true defensive Sacred Artifact, blocking every single one of Marreese's strikes without so much as a scratch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, Marreese had unleashed dozens of attacks, yet he hadn't even grazed Clara's clothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization hit him hard, and the audience below gasped in disbelief, murmurs of shock rippling through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go! Clara's already won! </span><span>Marreese isn't good enough</span><span> to pose a threat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned to leave, but Clara suddenly shifted gears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've let me down, Marreese. Is this really all you've got? Since you're so weak, I won't waste any more time. You can concede now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flick of her wrist, the chains that had been defending her transformed into serpents of steel, darting forward to ensnare Marreese's body and his blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face paled as he struggled against the binding chains, but it was futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Marreese had no choice but to begrudgingly admit defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd exploded into a flurry of astounded whispers and exclamations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marreese actually lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He lost to Clara from Fantasia Isle? She got defeated by Osborne before, but now she's taken down Marreese? I just can't wrap my head around it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I told you Clara was a force to be reckoned with! She only lost to Osborne </span><span>'cause</span><span> she got bribed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that she's beaten Marreese, it just goes to show how strong she is! If Marreese manages to beat Osborne tomorrow..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then it'll be clear that Clara took Osborne's money and threw the fight on purpose!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The audience was abuzz with wild speculation, but Osborne remained completely unfazed by all the chatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the battles on the third day kicked off.</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
