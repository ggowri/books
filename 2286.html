  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bright and early the next morning, a thunderous voice echoed through every nook and cranny of the Cloud-enshrouded Grand Complex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All state duel contestants, rally at the East Gate! We're heading out to the state duel area in ten minutes. If you're late, you're out of the game."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne cracked his eyes open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He got up and hightailed it out of his courtyard, making a beeline for the East Gate. His plan was to get the lay of the land and size up his competition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Osborne wasn't so full of himself that he thought he could wipe the floor with everyone, no matter the playing field, the situation, or the rules.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, getting a head start on understanding the environment was a no-brainer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Osborne stepped out of his courtyard, he saw folks pouring out of the neighboring ones too. Most of them were strangers to him, but he could piece together who they were by checking their courtyard numbers against the strength leaderboard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, someone hollered his name, "Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne whipped around and instantly recognized Gustave, who was ranked 103rd on the strength leaderboard. Gustave was the guy who'd hit him up about teaming up yesterday. After Osborne said no, he'd backed off gracefully, not pushing the issue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Osborne had a pretty good vibe about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gustave," Osborne greeted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's mosey on over to the East Gate together." Gustave grinned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't say no, and the two of them strolled side by side towards the East Gate. Before long, Gustave's teammates caught up with them. There were two more than there had been yesterday.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their team now totaled seven members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All seven of them were in the top 200 fighters, so it was a pretty solid team. But in Osborne's book, there was a major Achilles' heel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were lacking in heavy-hitting firepower!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave, being the team leader, was only ranked 103rd. He didn't stand a chance of getting those top 100 powerhouses on board. Even if he tried to sweet-talk them, they'd shoot him down in a heartbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave's team was well-balanced, but they were missing that knockout punch of a real champion. In the state duel, they'd probably end up getting their butts kicked by the truly tough teams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rules of the state duel stated that the first three days were all about hunting for tokens. In this stage, more hands meant more tokens, and more tokens meant more points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But come the fourth day, the state duel would shift into its second gear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It'd be </span><span>an </span><span>all out war!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone would be out to steal from each other. It'd be a classic case of the big dogs eating the little guys, and the little guys going after the minnows. The name of the game was to snatch other people's tokens and points while safeguarding one's own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, the rankings would be decided by the final scores.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without top-notch strength, there was no way to strike fear into the hearts of others. Once the state duel kicked off, Gustave's team would definitely be in the crosshairs of the top contenders. It'd be an uphill battle for them to hang onto their hard-earned points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, all these things were none of Osborne's business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Osborne caught sight of Clara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara wasted no time and walked right over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, and who's this, if I may ask?" Gustave asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied, "This is my partner, Clara! We're teaming up as a pair."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd asked Osborne to join his team but got shot down. Osborne had said he already had a set team, so Gustave didn't push it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave'd figured Osborne had blown him off because he'd lined up a stronger crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was just Clara?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave knew the state duel's strength leaderboard like the back of his hand. So, as soon as he heard Clara's name, he instantly knew her ranking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two hundred and ninety-ninth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Osborne turned me down to team up with Clara, who's ranked two hundred and ninety-ninth?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave rubbed his nose, wearing a look that was a mix of amusement and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave couldn't help but extend another invitation. "Osborne, Clara, how about joining my team after all? If you two team up, you'll have an uphill battle getting a decent result in the state duel. You won't rake in many rewards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a whole different ballgame if you join my team. We may not be the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me, but we're definitely high-ranked. Not many teams can hold a candle to us in the state duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you think my offer doesn't cut it, we can hash it out. I promise I'll make it worth your while."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave was dead serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne still shook his head with a smile. "Gustave, thanks for the offer, but we still can't take you up on it! It's not that your offer isn't good enough. We just prefer to stick together as a duo."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave looked disappointed. "Alright! Anyway, it's fate that we've crossed paths. If you run into any trouble in the state duel, just holler. We'll lend a hand if we can."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Gustave let the topic of teaming up drop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's opinion of Gustave went up a few notches because of his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared with the overbearing arrogance and condescending attitude of Conrad and Malcolm's team, Gustave's tactfulness was a breath of fresh air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Osborne was ruminating on Conrad, Malcolm, and the others, he suddenly caught sight of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And they spotted Osborne too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, Conrad and Malcolm sneered and sauntered over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, look who it is! Isn't this Osborne, ranked 108th on the strength leaderboard and the champion of Tempest Fortress City! Yesterday, he turned down Mr. Maurice's invitation, saying we weren't good enough to team up with him and that he'd give us a taste of our own medicine in the state duel!" Malcolm's sarcastic voice rang out right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People around them were immediately piqued and looked at Osborne in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who was Conrad?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a super-powerful heavyweight ranked 15th on the strength leaderboard. Most of those ranked higher than him hailed from top-notch forces like Chilling Nether Palace, Resurgent Throne Palace, and Fiery Volcanic Isle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conrad was also one of the heirs of the Maurice family of the Stellary Wolf Clan, a position of great prestige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Conrad has actually invited Osborne to join his team?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But Osborne has turned him down?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What's more, Osborne has allegedly boasted that Conrad isn't fit to team up with him and that he'd teach Conrad's team a lesson in the state duel?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's interest was immediately piqued. Since Malcolm had said it, they didn't question its authenticity and were eager to watch the drama unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned at this turn of events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Yeah, I did reject Conrad's invite, but I never said Conrad wasn't good enough to team up with me. And I sure as hell didn't say I'd teach them a lesson in the state duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Malcolm's just twisting the facts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What's his game?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Trying to make me look like an arrogant prick so people'll look down on me, mock me, or even take a swing at me during the state duel?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he thought this, Osborne fixed his steely gaze on Malcolm, his eyes glinting with a dangerous edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Malcolm's asking for trouble!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha? Staring daggers at me, huh? What are you gonna do? Throw a punch? Hey, folks, check this out! Osborne's about to take a swing at me!" Malcolm cackled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Malcolm, what the hell are you up to!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, someone stepped forward and stood in front of Osborne. "Malcolm, the state duel hasn't even kicked off yet. What the heck are you trying to start here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm glanced at the person and frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered and said, "Gustave? What business is this of yours? Did he join your team? Hmph! Ungrateful little... He wouldn't even join Mr. Maurice's team, but he joined your no-good bunch?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trash, just like I thought, can only hang out with other trash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words were like a sudden bolt of lightning on a clear day, instantly casting a dark, thunderous shadow across Gustave's face. In an instant, Gustave's hands clenched into tight fists.</span></p><div class="pagination">
