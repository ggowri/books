  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Palmers felt the presence of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face turned deathly pale, and he shouted in terror, "No!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you can't kill me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm the Godson of </span><span>Yalynch</span><span> from the Rosenthal family! My grandfather is a Class S Supreme Overlord, an equal to the Godfather! You can't kill me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you kill me, you will die with no place to be buried!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My grandfather will avenge me! If you dare kill me, not even the Godfather can save you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Palmers raged wildly, but Osborne's hand was steady. He didn't hesitate at all because of Palmers' words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slash!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Palmers' head flew into the air, his eyes still wide open. Even in death, he couldn't understand how Osborne dared to kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thud!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His head landed heavily on the ground and rolled a few times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared coldly at Palmers' corpse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you dared to come after me, you should have been prepared to die! Besides, you were the one who said we'd settle this with a fight to the death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Osborne looked up at Clarissa and Emma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Osborne's expression changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's situation was still under control. Luca seemed hesitant in their fight, not daring to go all out. Clarissa relied on the power of her Divine and Demonic Wings </span><span>and the Fate Staff to hold her ground. Although she was still being suppressed, she wasn't in any immediate danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa didn't have any injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Emma's situation was completely different. Even with the protection of the swallow shield, she couldn't match the fourteen Class AAA </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>. After using her trump card to take out two of them, she was left in a dire position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, she couldn't hold on any longer. Titan had snatched away her swallow shield and grabbed her small body with his massive hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha, die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Titan sneered, gripping Emma's body tightly, slamming her hard into the ground. Then, he began pounding her with his enormous fists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bam!!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bam!!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bam!!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Titan's fists pounded Emma's body repeatedly. She was nearly knocked unconscious, her energy scattered, and her eyes became unfocused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was about to die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Osborne's eyes turned red with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma had come to help him on her own!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what her true intentions were, Osborne felt he owed her. Seeing Emma being beaten so mercilessly, how could he not be furious?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne roared, rushing over quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dissolving Light!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While still on his way, Osborne summoned the power of the light element. A brilliant beam shot out, piercing Titan's chest and leaving a charred hole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But such a wound wasn't fatal to Titan's massive body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Titan's expression changed when he saw Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, he got free!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quick, kill this woman, then finish him off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Titan's eyes flashed with malice as he unleashed his ultimate move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Formidable Punch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His right arm detached, carrying terrifying power, and slammed down toward the fallen Emma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Emma were uninjured, without the swallow shield, she might not have been able to block such an attack. Now, she couldn't move at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could only watch as Titan's massive arm crashed like a cannonball.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scent of death surrounded her once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, this is it, huh? Damn it, I got the short end of the stick!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Emma closed her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Osborne's face changed. He realized he couldn't reach her in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth and shouted fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial Prison!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hum!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, with Emma at the center, 16 feet of space began to tremble, separating from the main space and forming a prison-like barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This prison both trapped Emma and protected Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Titan's ultimate attack struck the Spatial Prison, creating countless cracks, but it didn't shatter completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Titan's expression change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thunder!!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Judgment!!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne shouted angrily again, pointing fiercely at Titan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, a terrifying ten-foot-wide lightning bolt, glowing with purple-black light, descended from the sky like a pillar, striking Titan directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Titan didn't even have time to scream under the assault of the purple lightning. His body was obliterated, leaving nothing but a charred, one hundred yards deep crater where he once stood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the Thunder of Judgment!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne used Thunder of Judgment to kill Titan and finally reached Emma's side. He quickly scooped up her battered body. Seeing her barely clinging to life, his face was filled with rage.</span></p><div class="pagination">
