  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa's petrification power erupted. Terrible waves were transmitted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mighty petrification power instantly took effect on Osborne's body. Layers of stone skin quickly appeared, completely petrifying Osborne's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne was not panicked at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered. Martial art aura emitted a faint red glow and suddenly burst out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, all the petrifying effects were instantly dispersed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, "Duke Medusa, I said that when we meet next time, I will kill you! I wanted you to live a little longer, but since you came to me on your own initiative, I will...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll send you to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne punched Medusa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the blessing of the new martial art aura, Osborne's speed and strength were much stronger than before. Medusa raised her arms to defend herself, but was hit and flew backwards for hundreds of yards. She felt severe pain all over her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "No way. How did your strength become so strong in just a few days? And you are no longer affected by my petrification ability?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How on earth did you do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa couldn't believe it. Just ten days ago, Osborne was nothing in her eyes, who simply ran fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Osborne had almost no way to resist her except to run away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he resisted, he would die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, only ten days had passed, and Osborne had actually dared to attack her actively, and even hurt her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although this injury was not a big deal, and her body would recover quickly, Medusa still could not accept such a fact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was only at Class AA. How could he hurt her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a huge gap between the ordinary Class AA and Class AAA. But Osborne did it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Medusa's face extremely gloomy. And her eyes were full of murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn, you make me feel threatened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Therefore, I'm going to kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she finished speaking, an extremely bright light burst out from Medusa's eyes, and a sharp scream came out of her mouth. Suddenly, an even more terrifying petrification power broke out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suddenly discovered that the space around him seemed to be petrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression suddenly changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, before Osborne could react, he felt that half of his body had been petrified without him noticing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's martial art aura exploded wildly at this moment and finally resisted the petrification power, protecting his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The martial art aura was vibrating wildly, flashing an enchanting light red. Medusa's eyes continued to emit cold light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two forces were now caught in a tug-of-war.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was unable to restore his petrified body, and Medusa was unable to continue petrifying him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two started to consume each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was gloomy at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a terrifying petrification power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this the full strength of Class AAA? But even she can't use such an attack at will. And she can't sustain it for long!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's up to us who can stick to it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured and looked at Medusa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, bloody tears flowed from Medusa's eyes. As time passed, more and more blood appeared, making her look extremely terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible? I'm Class AAA, and I used the Intermediate Level of my petrification power! But I still can't completely petrify you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's something wrong with your martial art aura!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even the martial art aura of a Class AAA martial master cannot resist my petrification!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa spoke loudly, extremely shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was indeed something wrong with his martial art aura, because he was not a normal martial master. With the help of Isa, his soul of powers was integrated with his body. And his martial arts and powers were integrated into one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had ever done that before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Theoretically, his martial art aura could be easily integrated with any of his powers. At </span><span>this time, Osborne integrated his Devil's Light into the martial art aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's martial art aura was inherently powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eighth-level Devil's Light was so powerful that even he himself could hardly understand it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the two merged, Osborne finally had the courage to fight against the Class AAA, Duke Medusa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa wanted to petrify him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No way!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least, before Osborne's power was exhausted, Osborne, protected by the martial art aura, was invincible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Duke Medusa, it seems you can't hold on any longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled.</span></p><div class="pagination">
