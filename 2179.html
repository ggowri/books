  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Isa's words, a smile crept across Lord Malevolence's face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? You sensed it? I thought my efforts to conceal my power would fool you. Turns out, you're even stronger than I expected!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you've figured it out, I won't hold back any longer!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, an overwhelming surge of energy erupted from Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, everyone could clearly feel the intensity of his cultivation level.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ascension Ten!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King, also known as the quasi-Empyrean Sacredness warrior, stands on the cusp of an even more exalted realm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This lofty title implied that those who reached this stage were on the verge of attaining the state of Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Lord Malevolence had the capability to attempt merging various elemental powers. He could fuse different elemental forces, combine elemental power with divine power, blend divine power with physical strength, and even integrate physical strength with soul power.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any successful fusion would transform that power into true Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he achieved this, he could become an Empyrean Sacredness warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though this step was incredibly challenging, Lord Malevolence now had hope and the qualification to strive for Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On Celestara Planet, an Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King was already an absolute top-tier warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Celestara Planet had never seen an Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King before!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Lord Malevolence's terrifying Ascension Ten aura exploded forth, warriors across half of Celestara Planet who had reached the Deity King Level instantly sensed something.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They turned in fear to Lord Malevolence, their bodies trembling slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's expression shifted to one of grave seriousness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, she didn't back down. Instead, she murmured, "So it's really Ascension Ten! He was right; you're truly about to break through! If he hadn't made decisive changes, the Human Community might have been left in despair. But now..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa lifted her gaze to Lord Malevolence, her voice steely. "I believe he will return and put an end to this war, to you! For now, let me take you on and buy him more time!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm curious just how strong an Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King really is!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's fight!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To everyone's surprise, Isa took the initiative to strike.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, inky black flames roared to life around her, a menacing inferno that seemed to draw power from the darkest depths. Interwoven with the searing blaze, lightning zigzagged like silver serpents, each bolt crackling with raw, electric energy. A tempestuous gale howled past, and waves churned around her violently, as if the very ocean was responding to her call.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There, at the epicenter of this elemental chaos, Isa stood, a force of nature in her own right, as the combined might of these elements raged around her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being merely an Ascension Nine Supernal Deity King, she took the initiative to launch an attack against the Ascension Ten Lord Malevolence! It was a bold and audacious move.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, the gap in their cultivation levels was too vast.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa was quickly pushed back, her face paling as blood trickled from the corner of her mouth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead of retreating, she charged forward again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ferocious battle reignited, but this time, it was clear to everyone that Lord Malevolence was at ease while Isa was being overwhelmed!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa, Anastasia, and the others watched the fight with anxiety etched on their faces.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia suddenly asked, "Clarissa, I have a question!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without turning around, Clarissa asked, "What's on your mind? Go ahead..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, we heard that Isa claims to be the woman of the God of Night. Even the God of Light confirmed it... This revelation hit Osborne hard. He hasn't said a word to me, but I can feel how deeply it affected him! He can't believe that Isa would betray him...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So I want to know, did Isa really betray Osborne?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is she truly the woman of the God of Night? If she is, why would she get involved with Osborne?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia clenched her teeth as she finished speaking, and finally, Clarissa turned to look at her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, please tell me the truth!" Anastasia locked eyes with Clarissa; her determination was evident.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa hesitated for a moment before replying, "Anastasia, you should have more faith in Osborne! Isa hasn't betrayed him! She wouldn't do that..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then why does she claim to be the woman of the God of Night?" Anastasia pressed, urgency creeping into her voice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa chuckled softly, "Well... you might find out soon enough."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she didn't elaborate further and returned her attention to the unfolding battle, worry etched on her face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fight raged on.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's attacks remained relentless, but it was clear to everyone that she was struggling against Lord Malevolence. She was rapidly losing ground, and it was only a matter of time before she faced defeat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once she fell, the combined strength of all the Human Community warriors present wouldn't stand a chance against Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They would be easily wiped out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A crisis was looming!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in the deep space, a pained roar echoed from a dilapidated purple temple.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Osborne, crying out in agony like a wounded beast.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne! Hold on!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your bones have already fused with eighty percent of the World Tree fragments. Just hang in there for another half day, and you'll perfectly integrate this fragment into your skeleton!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When that happens, you'll possess the strongest bones in this cosmos! At the very least, you'll be among the strongest! Your physical body will surpass many Empyrean Sacredness warriors! Even those Apex Clans with innate advantages, like the Sacred Dragon Clan or Sacred Tiger Clan, will pale in comparison to you!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got to hang in there!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial, having transformed into a small tree creature, watched Osborne with great concern. He had done everything he could; now, it was all up to Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne could endure and perfectly integrate the World Tree fragment into his bones, he would gain unimaginable benefits at the physical level&mdash;benefits that even Primordial would envy!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This guy! What incredible willpower! I thought he'd only manage to fuse about thirty percent of the World Tree fragment, maybe fifty at most! Even that would have been a massive achievement... But here he is, already at eighty percent! He might actually pull off a perfect fusion!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial felt a rush of excitement at the thought.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A perfect fusion! Even though it's just a fragment of the World Tree, if he achieves a perfect integration, he might gain a portion of the World Tree's abilities... Something I don't even have at the moment!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Primordial continued to focus intently on Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And his energy signature is growing more terrifying by the second! The World Tree is the ruler of the Chaotic World, and the Chaotic World is the origin of this cosmos! The energy from the World Tree fragment merging with his body&mdash;only the heavens know how much benefit that will bring him!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he stopped fusing right now, he could instantly break through to Ascension Four! His divine power would become more refined and pure! His elemental essence would strengthen as well.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's incredible! Once he finishes the fusion and passes the Deity King Tribulation again, his power will skyrocket!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
