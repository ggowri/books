  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow was at a loss for words, her mouth twitching in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, she could no longer contain her fury. "Osborne, do you even grasp that we're up against dozens of Transcendent Deities? In a battle like this, what good is an Intermediate Deity? We need at least a few hundred Superior Deities to stand a chance! Why can't you be a bit more reliable like your grandfather?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustration bubbled within her as her mind raced, concocting plans for a desperate escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow thought to herself, "Osborne's trump card is a bunch of Junior and Intermediate Deities?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of joke is this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deschanel Clan doesn't just have twenty-nine Transcendent Deity warriors; they also boast fifteen Superior Deities, several Intermediate Deities, and over a hundred Junior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wouldn't even need the Transcendent Deities to take down Osborne's 'ace in the hole'!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is beyond reckless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow let out a weary sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Star, though equally bewildered, refused to believe that Osborne would be so foolish. Osborne's true ace up his sleeve was undoubtedly far more complex than they could fathom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, don't joke with Ms. Divine Shadow here. Show us your real trump card already!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, feeling cornered, replied in earnest, "I'm not joking! This is my real trump card!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laughter erupted from the members of the Deschanel Clan once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't believe the head of the Augustine family is such an idiot! Hahaha, this is priceless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think a gaggle of Junior Deities and a handful of Intermediate Deities can stand against our Transcendent Deity elders and patriarch? It's like offering your throat to a lion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bring as many as you like; we'll wipe the floor with them!" echoed another, reveling in their scorn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt his temper flare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You find this funny? Oh, you think it's all a joke?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see if you're still laughing in a bit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The laughter of the Deschanel Clan grew louder, and Divine Shadow and God of Star wished they could shrink into the ground from sheer embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was utterly humiliating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, wasn't deterred. He thought, "It's all because this two-way dimensional portal is too narrow! But that's no biggie. I can open more of them; that'll speed things up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, he sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sky around him began to tear open, revealing deep, swirling dimensional rifts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One after another, Blood Demon members began to emerge from these portals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Osborne had opened nineteen additional dimensional portals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, in total, there were twenty portals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each could allow ten Blood Demon members to pass through at once, meaning that two hundred more would join him every time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The number of Blood Demon members surged, their ranks swelling as they arrived in waves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the count reached one thousand, the once boisterous laughter from the Deschanel Clan faltered, shock replacing their earlier bravado. They gaped in astonishment at the endless stream of Blood Demon members pouring from the rifts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... what the hell is happening?" one stammered, bewildered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are those all Junior Deities? The Augustine family has over a thousand Junior Deities?" another gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way! How can that be possible?" A wave of panic washed over the Deschanel Clan warriors as they absorbed the reality of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you kidding me? We at the Deschanel Clan barely have two hundred who have ascended to godhood. How can a mere Augustine family boast this many deities? This is impossible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stared, dumbfounded, as the flow of Blood Demon members showed no signs of slowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Terrence and a few other Transcendent Deity warriors among the Deschanel Clan remained composed, whispering to one another about how to force the Augustine family into submission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If so many Junior Deities were at their disposal, it seemed like the perfect cannon fodder for their plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had yet to grasp the true gravity of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The number of Blood Demon warriors kept climbing, rapidly surpassing two thousand and still counting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, even Terrence and the other Transcendent Deity warriors of the Deschanel Clan felt an unsettling shift in the atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't understand how the Augustine family possibly had so many Junior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There Blood Demon members stood, armed to the teeth, their eyes gleaming with a menacing intensity. They formed a tightly-knit collective, their energy, presence, and aura melding into one intimidating force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if they weren't individual warriors but rather a single, unbreakable unit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell is going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence's earlier confidence evaporated, replaced by a crease in his brow as he fixated on the steadily increasing number of Blood Demon warriors emerging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The laughter that once filled the air had long since vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other members of the Deschanel Clan quickly shifted from mockery to dread, their faces reflecting tension that bordered on terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's smug grin was laced with a cold edge. "Still think it's funny? Why so quiet now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you still find Junior Deities laughable? When they reach a certain number, they can instill fear; mark my words!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And this is just the beginning!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that declaration, silence reigned among the Deschanel Clan. Nobody dared to challenge him, their eyes glued to the twenty dimensional portals, where more Blood Demon members continued to pour out in droves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three thousand! Four thousand!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, through one of the portals emerged the first Intermediate Deity.</span></p><div class="pagination">
