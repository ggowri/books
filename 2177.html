  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence finished speaking and cast a quick glance over Isa, Clarissa, Emma, and the others. His demeanor was remarkably relaxed, as if he were casually discussing what he would have for lunch that day.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This nonchalance conveyed an absolute confidence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite having witnessed Clarissa and Emma in action, and having seen Isa effortlessly defeat Ascension Eight's Ricky and take down Ascension Nine's Maddox with a single strike, he remained utterly assured of his own strength.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the ease in his expression made Clarissa and the others tense up. Even Isa couldn't help but furrow her brow slightly, her gaze locked onto Lord Malevolence as if she were trying to see right through him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But without him making a move, she couldn't even gauge his true power.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Could it be that he really has broken through to Ascension Ten?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ascension Ten, often referred to as the quasi-Empyrean Sacredness, was a significant milestone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Achieving this level meant enduring the Fourth Deity King Tribulation, a formidable challenge that, once overcome, would vastly enhance one's strength&mdash;far beyond that of a typical Ascension Nine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If Lord Malevolence has truly reached Ascension Ten, becoming a quasi-Empyrean Sacredness warrior, then we could be in serious trouble!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Isa kept her concern hidden.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calmly, she replied, "You want to wipe us out to force my teacher to appear? I doubt you can pull that off! I can handle you without his help!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence smiled at her words, "Is that so? Let's start with you, then!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm eager to see just how strong the God of Night's disciple really is. I hope you won't disappoint me!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Lord Malevolence stepped toward Isa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each stride he took, tendrils of ebony mist unfurled from his form, snaking around him like shadowy serpents. They swirled and coalesced, seamlessly melding into a suit of jet-black dragon-patterned armor. This armor transformed his once-slender frame, imbuing him with an air of towering grandeur and unrivaled dominance. Suddenly, a palpable, bone-chilling wave of power burst forth from his being, sending shockwaves through the very air.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eclipse War Armor!" Isa murmured, her expression now serious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence raised an eyebrow, a grin spreading across his face. "So you know about the Eclipse War Armor? It seems your teacher's dark elemental essence has reached the pinnacle of level ten! That's good to hear; I shouldn't be too disappointed then."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He appeared genuinely pleased.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having always regarded the God of Night as his greatest rival, he knew both of them specialized in dark power, and the Eclipse War Armor was a manifestation of his own dark elemental essence reaching Level Ten.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Since Isa knows about the Eclipse War Armor, it's clear the God of Night has also achieved Level Ten with his dark elemental essence. The next step would be the Sacredness Level!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Little girl! Your teacher is a worthy adversary, so I won't bully you. You can go first! I'll let you make three moves. Or else, when I get serious, you won't get a chance to fight back!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Lord Malevolence beckoned Isa with a finger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa scoffed, "Three moves? You're not worthy of that! My teacher wouldn't allow it, either! If we're going to fight, let's just fight&mdash;if not, then let's forget it!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she crossed her arms, signaling that she wouldn't make the first move.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence's expression turned mocking. "Foolish! We're at a life-and-death juncture, and you still care about pride! Just like your teacher, you're as foolish as they come! A thousand years ago, I offered to share Celestara Planet with him and rule it together!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I even offered him a position as the second king of the Malevolence Empire! But he rejected me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such foolishness! If he had agreed back then, how could Celestara Planet have fallen into this chaos for a thousand years? How many lives could have been spared? If he'd joined forces with me, the Malevolence Empire would have long since regained its power, and perhaps we would have already slashed our way back to the Racial Convergence Planet..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Lord Malevolence shook his head, dismissing the thought.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough of these unhappy memories! Since you don't want me to give you a head start, don't blame me! Even though I'm your elder, I won't hold back. Get ready... to meet your end!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Lord Malevolence raised both hands high.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eclipse of Eternity!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thick and impenetrable darkness descended like a shroud, enveloping Isa and the entire battlefield in an instant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic swept through everyone present.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They realized with horror that they could neither see nor hear anything; all their senses had been stripped away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this extreme darkness, fear began to take root, and even the most powerful of beings found it hard to remain calm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a cold voice pierced through the gloom.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, Lord Malevolence! These lousy tricks won't work on me. Come on, show me your real deal!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Isa's words fell, a brilliant light flashed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This light sliced through the darkness like a sharp blade, restoring visibility and allowing everyone to feel their senses return.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence exclaimed, his eyes gleaming with intrigue, "Interesting! You broke through my Eclipse of Eternity? Your teacher couldn't do that a thousand years ago! Your current strength exceeds what he was capable of back then!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not bad! Not bad at all!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since that's the case, I'll show you my true power!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, countless Shadow Drakes surged forth, roaring as they charged at Isa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each one was massive, blocking out the sky and instilling terror in everyone present&mdash;there were hundreds, if not thousands, of them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the Sanctum of Night, Clarissa, Emma, and Austin all turned pale. They could feel that each Shadow Drake possessed enough power to easily shatter their defenses, potentially injuring or even killing them!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer magnitude of this force made them sweat for Isa, their worry palpable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lord Malevolence's power has grown immensely since a thousand years ago!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can Isa withstand this?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When... will he return?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overwhelmed by a wave of dread, they felt completely powerless. They had once fought side by side with the God of Night against Lord Malevolence. Now, having reincarnated, they had indeed grown slightly stronger compared to their past selves. However, Lord Malevolence had evolved into an even more formidable foe.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they realized they were simply too weak to step forward and face him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying Shadow Drakes seemed capable of tearing the very fabric of reality as they relentlessly surged toward Isa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing amidst the chaos, Isa wore a serious expression as she finally felt the pressure.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She whispered, "You were right... Lord Malevolence is indeed stronger!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we don't come up with a new strategy, it'll be tough to stop him with your strength! But I still want to give it a shot..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a fierce light ignited in Isa's eyes&mdash;a dark, swirling glow.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shouted, "Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, equally massive and terrifying Shadow Drakes surged outward from Isa, charging forward with ferocity.</span></p><div class="pagination">
