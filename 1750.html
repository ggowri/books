  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, his tone calm but firm, "Let's take some time to rest and see how the Bowman family reacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as we're hidden here, with the Eclipsing Mantra shielding us, no one will suspect a thing. Everyone should focus on your training, work on enhancing your potential and Divine Body, and aim to break through to the Deity King realm as soon as possible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nods of agreement passed through the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had fought fiercely in the recent battle, each of them facing off against Deity King warriors and even managing to defeat a few.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, instead of feeling proud, they were acutely aware of their own limitations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Take Aldrich, for instance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aside from Osborne, none of them could match Aldrich's strength, and he wasn't even considered a top-tier warrior in Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew that in the future, they would encounter even stronger opponents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they remained at their current level, they wouldn't stand a chance. If multiple foes stronger than Aldrich appeared at once, they would only be a burden to Osborne, forced to flee rather than fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm heading to Hope Haven to enter seclusion and push my Divine Body to Level Seven! Once I hit that mark, I'll break through to Deity King, and my Divine Body will undergo another transformation. I'll be much stronger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to Hope Haven too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Me as well!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, turning to her, "Hannah, you should join them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your cultivation level is still too low, but I have plenty of Celestial Crystals. I believe you'll catch up quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah bit her lip and nodded, determination flickering in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the group made their way into Hope Haven, ready to harness the power of the Celestial Crystals and the abundant energy within the sanctuary for their training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of his hand, Osborne activated his time power over Hope Haven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time accelerated&mdash;tenfold!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the span of ten days within Hope Haven, only a single day passed outside. For Anastasia, Zoe, and the others, it was like having ten times the training time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the absolute limit of what Osborne could achieve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My time power comes from the Satan's Eye! The stronger the Satan's Eye, the more potent my time power becomes! Now that my Satan's Eye has reached Level Nine, it's time to take it to the next level!" Osborne resolved, feeling a surge of purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The recent battle against Aldrich, a mid-stage Deity King, had highlighted his own weaknesses. He needed to raise his level and enhance his techniques; his current skills were just mediocre against someone like Aldrich.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll use the core energy from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to boost my Satan's Eye!" Osborne decided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't enter Hope Haven himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Infinite Devouring Eyes were already within, assisting him in absorbing energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even without actively seeking to advance his own cultivation, his level was rising rapidly&mdash;faster, in fact, than Hannah's progress using the Celestial Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he focused solely on enhancing his Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are only four core energies left from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity! I hope these four energies will elevate my Satan's Eye to Level Ten!" he murmured, slipping into a state of focused meditation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Satan's Eye absorbed one of the core energies, it surged with power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne remained busy, delving deeper into techniques like "Spatial Clone" and "Undead Cataclysm."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And so, time flowed slowly, each moment a step closer to their goals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Central Zone of Celestara, atop an immense and ancient mountain peak, stood a magnificently archaic palace. Within this palace, wisps of green smoke spiraled upwards, creating an ethereal atmosphere that radiated a sense of divinity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the stronghold of the Bowman family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the ancestral hall of the Bowman family, two blood-red tokens lay shattered on the floor, a haunting testament to a profound calamity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing in the center of the hall was Maxine, the head of the Bowman family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was drawn tight with gravity, and an undercurrent of rage emanated from him, causing the very palace to tremble as if it might collapse under the weight of his fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aldrich, my son! Alfred, my grandson!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who killed you?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's voice roared through the hall, filled with a murderous intent that sent chills through the air. As he spoke, snow began to fall, blanketing the towering mountain in a thick layer of white, while dark clouds rolled in, shrouding the world in gloom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire Bowman family stronghold felt the reverberation of his rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, a dozen powerful figures rushed into the ancestral hall, urgency written all over their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They bowed slightly before Maxine, who glared at them with barely restrained fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Maxine Bowman, we just received news that everyone we sent to the East Zone, including Mr. Alfred Bowman, has been killed!" one of the warriors reported, his voice strained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this grim revelation, a darker shade of fury sparked in Maxine's eyes. "Who did this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was a group known as the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings! Their leader is a man named... Theodore Augustine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine froze for a moment, a flicker of recognition passing through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings? Theodore Augustine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured the name, feeling an unsettling familiarity as if it lingered on the edge of his memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Maxine quickly brushed it aside, his focus sharpening into icy determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Immediately relay my orders. Issue the Stellar Pursuit Mandate! We must hunt down the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings! Kill without mercy!" he commanded, his voice a storm of authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The echo of his words reverberated through the hall.</span></p><div class="pagination">
