  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you're finally awake!" Sebastian exclaimed, his previous worries and frowns dissipating like morning mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, I'm fine!" Osborne replied</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing beside Sebastian were Wesson and Matthew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but stare at Matthew in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew, a member of the younger generation of the Augustine family, now stood </span><span>side by side</span><span> with Sebastian and Wesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This </span><span>meant</span><span> a significant elevation in his status. He was now a key player in the </span><span>Augustine family, representing the Wise Order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What struck Osborne even more was the powerful aura radiating from Matthew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Class S?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew has reached Class S? Just three months ago, he was barely scraping by at Class AAA, and now he's a top-tier Class S?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Wesson, too. He's at the pinnacle of Class S!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he recalled the explosive surge of star power that had erupted three months </span><span>before</span><span>, it all began to make sense. In such a rich environment of star power, many people's abilities would have skyrocketed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more talent one had, the greater the boost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the younger generation of the Augustine family, Matthew was undoubtedly among the best, with only a few, like Vincent, Emma, and Owen being his equals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just three months, he had leaped from Class AAA to top-tier Class S, which, while astonishing, was understandable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had always believed that Matthew possessed the strongest management skills among their peers; it made perfect sense for him to be entrusted with such an important role.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, everyone," Osborne greeted them, noting the </span><span>worry</span><span> and </span><span>fatigue </span><span>deep down</span><span> </span><span>their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, a lot had </span><span>happened</span><span> during his prolonged slumber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia, take Zoe back to her room and wait for me," he instructed</span><span>. He was curious </span><span>about what had happened over the last three months.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anastasia shook her head firmly, clinging to his arm</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, okay." Osborne relented, not wanting to push her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to Sebastian, he asked, "Grandpa, what's been going on while I was out? You all look like you've seen a ghost. Is it about the League of Divine Descent or the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before falling into his deep sleep, Osborne had wiped out the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, and Gerardo was dead. The only remaining threats to the Augustine family were the League of Divine Descent and the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, </span><span>a sudden transformation</span><span> happened</span><span> to </span><span>the Blue Planet</span><span>. With the surge of star power, the flora, fauna, and even humans were flooded with energy, leading to rapid evolution and mutation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This </span><span>typically lasted </span><span>three months to six months before stabilizing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this </span><span>time, </span><span>factions should have been preoccupied with adapting to the new world, leaving them little opportunity to attack the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's neither the League of Divine Descent nor the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization. We're facing something far worse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression hardened instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Worse?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something more dangerous than the League of Divine Descent and the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What could it be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Has the Dark Deity awakened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian quickly summarized the events of the past three months.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In </span><span>just three months, the environment of Blue Planet underwent a </span><span>dramatic transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plants proliferated wildly, animals became restless, and ordinary people found </span><span>all </span><span>their ailments </span><span>vanishing</span><span> and</span><span> </span><span>powers</span><span> appearing inside them from nowhere</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With so many suddenly empowered, chaos inevitably ensued. Once endowed with strength, who would </span><span>want</span><span> to remain an average Joe</span><span> and work for others</span><span>?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>N</span><span>o one</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fistfights, vandalism, robberies, and even cold-blooded murders became the norm. These newly-minted super beings, no longer willing to scrape by at the bottom of society, harbored deep resentment for the wealthy elite, the Ancient Families, and the superpowers that held vast resources.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under </span><span>instigation</span><span>, they banded together, launching assaults on these wealthy entities across the land, plundering their riches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such incidents </span><span>happened every day</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosmandi</span><span>, a populous yet weakly-governed region, witnessed even more severe unrest. As </span><span>Rosmandi's</span><span> first financial colossus, the Draco Group, with extensive holdings nationwide, became the prime target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, these attacks, though numerous, barely </span><span>harmed</span><span> </span><span>the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The family</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s</span><span> formidable power was well beyond the reach of these recently awakened masses, who caused mere nuisances rather than crippling blows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, as time progressed, such chaos began to dwindle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wild beasts had also evolved!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They grew monstrously powerful, far surpassing human capabilities. Not content to rule the wild alone, they frequently ventured into cities, wreaking havoc.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Th</span><span>ey</span><span> </span><span>blocked</span><span> inter-city transportation</span><span>, gradually </span><span>forming the</span><span> Beast Tides.</span></p><div class="pagination">
