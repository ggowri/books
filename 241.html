  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek's anguished cries echoed through the chaos as he watched Osborne effortlessly take down three Class B+ metahumans, his face a mask of disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These three were the Chevalier family's hidden aces, each one a powerful asset acquired at a staggering cost. They were the family's ultimate trump cards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, they were all dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek's eyes burned with rage and frustration. He had thought his meticulously laid trap would ensnare Osborne, allowing him to kill Osborne and avenge his son, Apollo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had underestimated Osborne's abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek never imagined that four Class B+ metahumans working together couldn't even dent Osborne's defenses. Instead, Osborne had severely wounded one, killing three in return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adding to his horror, the three hundred elite fighters he had meticulously arranged were being slaughtered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were the Chevalier family's finest warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, against hundreds of armed robots and drones, they were utterly defenseless, falling in waves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The root of their downfall was that damned, eerie song.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it hadn't been for that song disorienting everyone so quickly, their skills alone would have ensured they weren't decimated so brutally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But alas, there were no second chances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek knew he had lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had grossly misjudged Osborne's power, failing to anticipate that Osborne possessed spatial abilities. Osborne wasn't just unaffected by gravity; he could use dimensional rifts to appear right behind Derek, delivering a devastating blow from the get-go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was more, Derek hadn't expected Osborne to deploy such a vast number of powerful battle robots and drones so silently via Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he certainly hadn't foreseen that the strange song would even affect Class B+ metahumans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had lost completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek's eyes were red with fury and desperation as he stared at Osborne, his body shaking uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't even attempt to flee, knowing it was pointless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how fast he was, he couldn't outrun Osborne's spatial power. Without any allies, he stood no chance against the Vampire-enhanced Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek roared, "Who are you? I've investigated you thoroughly. Despite the Chevalier family's resources, all I found was your name&mdash;Osborne. It's as if you're shrouded in mystery, with someone deliberately hiding all information about you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me, which superpower are you from? Tell me who I've lost to. I want to understand why I'm dying here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face twisted into a cold smirk as he heard Derek's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He replied calmly, "My name is Osborne Augustine. I'm not affiliated with any superpower."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's impossible!" Derek shot back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged nonchalantly. "Believe what you want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek furrowed his brow and coldly stated, "If I'm not mistaken, you're wearing a </span><span>skinmask</span><span>? Unveil your face, let me go in peace! As an exchange, I'll sign away this diamond mine to you. Otherwise, even if you kill me, you'll never get your hands on this cursed mine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly mulled over his options, then nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Agreed. After you sign the transfer agreement, I'll show my true face."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, the battle at the diamond mine was drawing to a close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The state-of-the-art Class A combat robots and drones Osborne had deployed, costing a fortune and not even available for purchase, had overwhelmed the Chevalier family's best of three hundred fighters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the help of Valentin and others, they'd been decimated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not even Class-B metahumans could withstand their onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle was over in short order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin personally delivered the transfer agreement and handed it to Derek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek's hand trembled as he gritted his teeth and signed his name on the document.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin checked the agreement, then nodded excitedly to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, the agreement is in order!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek stared intently at Osborne. "As per our agreement, I've signed the transfer of this unlucky diamond mine to you. Now, you can reveal your true face, can't you? I </span><span>want to know whom have I actually lost to!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne offered a slight smile. "Of course, I always keep my word."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne removed his </span><span>skinmask</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek's eyes widened in surprise as he gazed at Osborne's youthful face. When he finally recognized Osborne, he couldn't believe his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... You! How can it be you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're the head security by Clarissa's side!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek never imagined the person who defeated him would be so young or that the mysterious boss from </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security Services was just an unremarkable bodyguard by Clarissa's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne offered a nonchalant smile, saying, "That's right, it's me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek erupted into maniacal laughter. "How can it be you! How can it be you! Haha, I, Derek, the head of an ancient family, making my way through </span><span>Skyefall</span><span>, not even the Radcliffe family is beneath my notice! And I've actually lost to you? To Clarissa's bodyguard? Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek suddenly spewed a mouthful of blood, his eyes filled with unwillingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression remained cold and fierce. "Derek, you've seen enough. It's time to go on your journey. Your son has been waiting for you in hell for a long time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne swiftly moved his sharp fingernails, which were transformed from his vampire form and like blades, slicing across Derek's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With blood spraying out, Derek fell to the ground, his eyes filled with unwillingness as he slowly closed them.</span></p><div class="pagination">
