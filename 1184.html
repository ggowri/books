  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wavered, torn between his thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, he was resolute in killing Cain; Cain's survival posed a colossal threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was a Cosmic Treasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If its secrets fell into others' hands, the entire world would go mad, particularly since he hadn't yet mastered true immortality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Currently, he was still killable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And even if he did achieve true immortality, it was best not to reveal the secrets of the lotus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Night had already demonstrated the ability to strip the lotus from Cain, trapping him in the depths of the earth for eons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't want to share Cain's fate of enduring solitude for millennia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That kind of existence was worse than death itself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, for the sake of keeping his possession of the lotus a secret, Cain must die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the dead could truly keep secrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Cain had once completed the fifth phase of fusion with the lotus. He held the key to further fusions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain claimed that subsequent phases would be ten times more perilous&mdash;a near-death experience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of reliving such danger, let alone tenfold, sent shivers down Osborne's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He feared that without Cain's guidance, he might not survive the third and fourth phases of fusion with the lotus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The prospect of dying in the process was daunting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, the question remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill? Or not kill?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Considering that Cain might not have sensed his intent but was merely preemptively </span><span>striking a deal, Osborne continued, "What about the fifth phase of fusion?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain smirked, "The fifth phase is naturally even harder! But once you complete it, your immortality will be truly formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bear in mind, after the fourth phase, while you possess true immortality, resurrection comes at a cost&mdash;a colossal energy requirement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fortunately, the lotus' energy is abundant enough to resurrect a Deity King countless times. But just completing the fourth phase might limit how much energy the lotus willingly gives you for resurrection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In my estimation, the fourth phase allows only a limited number of resurrections&mdash;perhaps a hundred at most. And the recovery time grows longer with each resurrection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The first might take mere minutes, while the tenth could need an hour. By the hundredth, the lotus might refuse to revive you altogether, potentially even disassociating from you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So even with the fourth phase, true immortality isn't absolute? Limited resurrection?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought achieving the fourth phase meant I could throw caution to the wind, risking my life without fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, it seems there are still limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Better stay cautious!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain continued, "And upon completing the fifth fusion, your bond with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity becomes even closer! Not only does the recovery speed up and the number of restorations increase&mdash;potentially reaching tens of thousands of times&mdash;but crucially, you gain the ability to choose your resurrection location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dying here doesn't mean you'll resurrect right here; you could reappear billions of miles away. This way, your enemies can't simply keep killing you to exhaust your resurrection chances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With a bit of caution, true immortality becomes achievable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain finished, and Osborne felt a surge of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, completing the fifth fusion with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity is when the real transformation occurs! It's when one truly attains a form of immortality. No wonder even the God of Night couldn't utterly annihilate Cain!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's thoughts darkened with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cain must die! His threat is too great.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he knows how to safely complete the third, fourth, and even fifth fusions with the lotus, I cannot let him live.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only there were a way to obtain his knowledge and still kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wait, perhaps, after killing him, I could extract his memories?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain, once a Deity Overlord warrior, had a wealth of experiences&mdash;a seasoned killer who had escaped countless revenge plots and assassination attempts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't rely on spatial powers but on his extensive knowledge of evasion and combat techniques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne could eliminate Cain and acquire his memories, not only would he learn </span><span>how to continue fusing with the lotus safely, but he would also absorb a vast amount of combat wisdom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Cain was a dark elemental metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gaining Cain's memories would significantly enhance Osborne's control over Dark Power, catapulting his strength to new heights.</span></p><div class="pagination">
