  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it weren't for the fact that I need you to navigate through the treacherous spatial turbulence to reach that tree's lair, I wouldn't dream of parting with this Bloodwrought Armor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald's eyes held a hint of reluctance as he carefully placed the armor into Osborne's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He added with a knowing look, "And remember this, the Bloodwrought Armor can also amplify your strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up at those words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly donned the Bloodwrought Armor, and in an instant, he felt a surge of power, at least doubling his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, an overwhelming sense of security enveloped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clad in vivid crimson armor and a flowing red cloak, he resembled a warrior returning from a fierce battlefield, soaked in glory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paired with his already handsome features, Osborne exuded an aura that could only be described as strikingly heroic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Creation Herald paused, momentarily taken aback by the transformation. Just for a flicker, jealousy flashed in his eyes&mdash;Osborne radiated a commanding presence that overshadowed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed as if he had become Osborne's subordinate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, enough flaunting! Let's put that away for now!" the Creation Herald huffed, his annoyance cutting through the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a mere thought, Osborne made the Bloodwrought Armor meld seamlessly into his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that we've covered the defensive divine artifacts, let's move on to weapons! According to your request, I've prepared an assortment of elemental weapons&mdash;space elemental, dark elemental, lightning elemental, soul elemental, light elemental, life elemental, fire elemental, earth elemental, water elemental, and even pure power-themed super divine artifacts. Every single one of them is a masterpiece of mine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald began showcasing his collection with gusto.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but admire the sheer quality of the weapons presented. Each one boasted the status of a super divine artifact, far surpassing the likes of the Supreme Malevolence Sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were designed to dramatically enhance the skill of the wielder, ranging from daggers and swords to gauntlets, spears, and bows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after experiencing the prowess of the Bloodwrought Armor, Osborne found himself feeling less enthusiastic about the weapons. Sure, they were top-notch, capable of outfitting the likes of Anastasia and Zoe to the teeth, significantly boosting their fighting capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for him, they just didn't measure up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He craved a weapon that could rival the Bloodwrought Armor in power and prestige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Creation Herald wrapped up his presentation of fifty weapons, a tinge of disappointment crept into Osborne's demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing Osborne's lack of excitement, the Creation Herald scoffed and said, "You seem a bit underwhelmed. Are my weapons just not cutting it for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled awkwardly, "Not at all! They're impressive, it's just that after seeing the Bloodwrought Armor, it's hard not to feel like these lack the same appeal. Do you have anything that matches its caliber?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald's expression turned disdainful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really are greedy! Do you have any idea how rare the Bloodwrought Armor is? You want a weapon that's on its level? Well, I just might have something for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Creation Herald wore an expression of pride as he continued, "In order to ensure you can effectively harm the tree's main body, I have prepared a weapon that will definitely satisfy you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a confident grin, the Creation Herald retrieved something special from the Dimensional Bag&mdash;a vivid crimson bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The material of the bow's body was unmistakably forged from the bones of a powerful Sacred Dragon Clan warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald announced, his voice brimming with pride, "This is the Bloodwrought Bow!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As you can see, it's crafted from the bones of the Sacred Dragon Clan's warriors, and the bowstring? That's made from their dragon tendons!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The power of the Bloodwrought Bow is immense; it doesn't even need a physical string. Just channel your divine power or any other extraordinary energy, and you can conjure arrows of pure force! These arrows will be imbued with the might of the Sacred Dragons, making it difficult for your enemies to evade them and significantly enhancing their impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In short, this is an Ultimate super divine artifact!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flicker of reluctance crossed the Creation Herald's features as he handed the Bloodwrought Bow to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This bow has three Divine Marks of the Divine Ascendance Technique engraved by my true form. I've infused these marks with power, and once activated, you can unleash three arrows of the Divine Ascendance Technique!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With this Bloodwrought Bow in your arsenal, even if you're not a Supernal Deity King, you'll be able to injure that tree's true form! Remember, when you confront the tree, activate all three Divine Marks immediately and shoot those three arrows before you make a quick getaway!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's all I can do for you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can't hurt that tree with both the Bloodwrought Armor and the Bloodwrought Bow, then you're nothing but a liability!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you survive, I'll hunt you down and eliminate you before you can reincarnate, taking back the Bloodwrought Armor and the Bloodwrought Bow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes glinted with a menacing threat, but Osborne was too captivated by the bow to pay it much mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, he gripped the Bloodwrought Bow tightly, feeling a surge of power course through him. It was as if he could sense the very essence of a Sacred Dragon Clan warrior resonating within the bow&mdash;it felt alive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What an incredible treasure!" Osborne exclaimed, completely ignoring the Creation Herald's ominous warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archery was second nature to him; after all, back on Blue Planet, he was quite the sharpshooter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination, he infused a bit of spatial energy into the bow and pulled the string back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, a transparent arrow materialized on the bowstring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He aimed at a small mountain 60 miles away and released it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the arrow shot forth, vanishing from sight, only to reappear moments later, slamming into the mountain with tremendous force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire mountain crumbled under the impact, reduced to rubble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His breath quickened with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "The arrow just performed interdimensional travel! Just like my Spatial Oblivion Slash, but faster and more powerful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I'd had the Bloodwrought Bow earlier, I wouldn't have had to go through all that trouble dealing with the life elemental Ascension Three Supernal Deity King from the Paramount Supreme Clan. A single shot from afar would have been enough to seriously wound him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is a fantastic weapon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the real kicker? The Bloodwrought Bow was inscribed with three Divine Marks, each representing a Divine Ascendance Technique that could be reused!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he realized with a twinge of frustration that replenishing the energy for those marks would be a monumental challenge at his current level.</span></p><div class="pagination">
