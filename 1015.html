  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe stood there, stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mused, "Anastasia isn't an Earthling? She's from </span><span>Celestara</span><span>? I might be too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she heard Isa call her over, she felt anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after a moment of hesitation, she took a deep breath and stepped closer to Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Bowin... if I'm not an Earthling but one of those </span><span>Celestara</span><span> people, will you turn your back on me? Or worse, will you kill me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's voice trembled, tears threatening to spill over as she thought, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did I suddenly turn into an alien?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa burst into laughter, lightly tapping Zoe on the head. "What on earth are you worrying about?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether you're from Blue Planet or </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, you're still human! We're all intelligent beings born from this land. As long as you haven't been tainted by the scent of death or turned into a monster, why on earth would I want to harm you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she placed her hand gently on Zoe's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Isa froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she closed her eyes and began to focus intently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, sensing something was off, placed his hand on Zoe's head as well. Zoe, feeling completely bewildered, stood frozen, unsure of what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what felt like an eternity, both Osborne and Isa stopped their probing, exchanging glances filled with astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't sense anything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Me neither."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa furrowed her brow, studying Zoe closely, causing an unsettling feeling to rise within Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe asked, "Ms. Bowin, Osborne, what's going on? Am I an alien?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa shook her head, looking bewildered. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is strange! Anastasia is definitely from </span><span>Celestara</span><span>; the Crystal of Life in her mind proves that! But you, on the other hand, don't have the Crystal of Life in your brain, which means you are an Earthling, not one of them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of relief washed over Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Thank goodness I'm not an alien!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But wait! I'm Anastasia's twin sister! That can't be right. If she's from </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, how could I not be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and began to speak calmly, "I think I might have figured it out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe one of your parents was an Earthling, while the other was </span><span>Celestara</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least twenty years ago, one of your parents somehow arrived on Blue Planet from </span><span>Celestara</span><span> and then fell in love with someone here. That's how you two were born!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Anastasia and Zoe are twins; one has the Crystal of Life, and the other doesn't!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne finished explaining, Isa nodded in agreement. "That must be it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's expression shifted to one of grave concern. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Celestara</span><span> people can enter Blue Planet? It looks like someone has secretly opened a portal connecting the two worlds!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're really asking for trouble. This could even lead to the destruction of the entire Blue Planet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression darkened as he pressed for more details, but Isa simply shook her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No use for you to learn about these. With your current strength, there's not much you can change! Let's see after you break through to Class S."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sly smile, she looked at Osborne. "</span><span>Fatebearer</span><span> must be nearing her Class AAA breakthrough, huh? Just let her use her fate power to cleanse and strengthen your body, and you should be able to break into Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, what do you think? Bet you can't wait to push her onto the bed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt himself turning crimson, caught off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, trying to play it cool, "Clarissa has actually already broken through to Class AAA but hasn't woken up yet. I'll hit Class S soon. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm just beginning to realize this world isn't as simple as I thought. If you're not Class S, it's like you don't even have the right to see what's really going on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa knew Osborne was deliberately changing the subject, but she simply smiled and didn't mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even reaching Class S isn't enough," Isa said, turning away from Osborne to look at Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You need to focus on your training. Your body carries the genes of </span><span>Celestara</span><span> human though without Crystal of Life. Your talent is far beyond that of ordinary Earthlings! Your progress will accelerate rapidly...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get strong as quickly as you can! I can sense that the world is on the brink of chaos! Whether it's Blue Planet or </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, turmoil is imminent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Isa motioned to Osborne with a playful finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face lit up with a charming smile as she said, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take me to the room! Now that I'm back, let's make the most of my man's services."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's jaw dropped at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Could she really say such things in front of a child?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, Zoe's face turned crimson as she understood what Osborne and Isa were about to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe quickly lowered her head and said, "Um, I'll take care of Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, Ms. Bowin, you two go ahead, don't worry about me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out an exasperated sigh and glared at Isa, who only giggled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry up! I need to find the God of Time! I'm giving you two hours!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two hours, no breaks!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
