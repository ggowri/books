  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had no intention of retreating; behind him were Sebastian, Anastasia, and the rest of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their condition was already dire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their desperate attempt to shield more of their kin from the relentless assault of the twelve Superior Deities from the Deschanel Clan, they had taken more than their fair share of punishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were barely hanging on, and if Osborne stepped aside, some of them would undoubtedly suffer catastrophic injuries, if not worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought weighing heavily on him, Osborne stood firm, his body a bulwark against the impending doom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne might not be entirely confident in his ability to withstand the full force of the twelve deities' attack, but with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity at his disposal, he was certain he wouldn't meet his end today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nightshade Wings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes turned icy as Osborne summoned the full might of his Level Five peak dark elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of chaotic dark power erupted behind him, coalescing into a pair of colossal wings that spread out to a staggering three hundred yards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Nightshade Wings unfurled, they enveloped Osborne, wrapping around him like a protective cocoon just as the combined assault of the twelve deities came crashing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Nightshade Wings were versatile&mdash;capable of offense and defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By manifesting them, Osborne fortified his defenses. He wasn't afraid of getting hurt; after all, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity would heal him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But healing took time, and if the twelve deities struck while he was recovering, he wouldn't be able to protect his family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Osborne couldn't afford to be injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Nightshade Wings surrounded him, a wave of relief washed over him. But the next moment, he was engulfed by the overwhelming force of the deities' attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian, Anastasia, and the others cried out in horror, their faces drained of color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They felt a deep sense of anguish, as if they could already see Osborne being reduced to nothing but a pile of flesh and bone under the relentless barrage of the Superior Deities' might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, in the very next instant, their mouths fell open in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The devastating strikes rained down upon Osborne's Nightshade Wings, creating violent ripples across the surface. Dark power surged wildly, as if on the brink of shattering, yet somehow, the wings held firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if a tiny boat was braving a stormy sea, teetering on the edge of capsizing but somehow managing to ride the waves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ferocious onslaught gradually subsided, and while the Nightshade Wings bore signs of damage, they remained intact, shielding Osborne like a steadfast fortress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The combined might of the twelve Superior Deities had failed to breach his defenses. Not to mention, Osborne still had the Ethereal Glow for protection and a robust Divine Body to back him up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He emerged unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene left not only Sebastian and Anastasia in shock but also the twelve deities from the Deschanel Clan. They stared at Osborne in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this even possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even a regular Transcendent Deity would struggle to withstand a combined attack from all twelve of us! And yet, he's using nothing but a pair of energy wings to block all our strikes?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The faces of the twelve Superior Deities turned pale as they scrutinized Osborne, searching for any sign of his true power. But there was nothing above his head&mdash;no flicker of Divine Flame to indicate his status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No Divine Flame?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is he not even a deity?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of monster is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The twelve Deities were left utterly baffled, unaware that Osborne had employed the Eclipsing Mantra to conceal his Divine Flame. They were convinced they had encountered something truly extraordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a cool scoff, his demeanor shifting as his Nightshade Wings unfurled behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They expanded to over three hundred yards, a massive and intimidating sight. When Osborne met the onslaught from the twelve Superior Deities of the Deschanel Clan, he remained unharmed, bolstering Osborne's confidence and making him realize that his power was likely exceeding his own expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his gaze fixated on the twelve foes, Osborne declared in an icy tone, "You're all asking for it! Time for you to meet your end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne sprang into action. He whipped his Nightshade Wings powerfully, and his body shot forward like a bolt of lightning. The wings morphed into two gigantic, razor-sharp blades, slicing effortlessly through everything in their path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne appeared behind one of the Deschanel Clan's Superior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The look of dread crept onto the deity's face as he glanced down at his chest, his eyes wide with disbelief and regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could react, a deep crimson gash opened across his torso.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wound widened, blood pouring forth, and in a brutal moment, the onlookers gasped in shock as his body was suddenly cleaved in two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was dead&mdash;just like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the Deschanel Clan's Superior Deities had been brutally bisected by Osborne's </span><span>Nightshade Wings, unable to comprehend what had happened before his life was extinguished.</span></p><div class="pagination">
