  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that critical moment between life and death, Osborne finally made up his mind, his expression shifting to one of steely determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to save her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if it meant exposing his identity, Osborne had to rescue Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had helped him in the past, providing valuable information he hadn't known before, much of it confidential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the Mystic Feather Clan was the only race among Lord Malevolence's forces that would protect the Human Community and advocate for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, Hannah was his companion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had come this far together, and even if they weren't friends yet, they were comrades in arms. Osborne wasn't the type to abandon a comrade in dire straits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, in that instant, he sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harnessing the peak energy of Level Six space elemental essence, he unleashed his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of spatial fluctuation enveloped Hannah, and in a blink, she vanished from her spot and reappeared right in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, the Deity Overlord-level Deathborn's attack struck where she had just been, the force reverberating through the cavern. The impact hit the solid rock, shaking the entire mine, and a rain of debris fell from above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had Osborne hesitated even for a moment longer, that blow would have obliterated Hannah's Divine Body into a mangled pile of flesh. Even with a Level Six Divine Body, she wouldn't have survived that hit&mdash;not even with her mastery of life power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, that disaster never came to pass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wrapped his arms around Hannah, his heart sinking as he assessed her injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The damage was severe; her Divine Body was cracked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, her divine elemental essence remained intact, or the situation would have become even more dire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hannah, are you okay?" he asked with concern etched across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Startled, Hannah opened her eyes wide. In disbelief, she found herself cradled in Osborne's arms. She blinked, confusion spreading across her features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I... dead? Lachlan, are you dead too? Is this... Hell?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but chuckle nervously, relief flooding through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed Hannah had no clue what had just happened or that he had used his spatial power to save her in that life-or-death moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That meant he wouldn't need to explain his abilities or risk revealing his identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not dead! And I definitely am not! But if you don't do something soon, you might not be too far off! Can you still use your power? Quickly! Tap into your life power and replenish your vitality!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his urging, Hannah froze again, trying to process everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're still alive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she felt the surge of two powerful presences charging toward them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whipping her head around, Hannah saw the two furious Deity Overlord-level Deathborns bearing down on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch out!" she shouted instinctively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was no need for her warning. Osborne was already on the move, activating Thunderform Flash. Lightning crackled around him and Hannah, propelling them away from the impending threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deathborn's attack once again fell short, but their rage intensified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They roared in fury, their speed amplifying as they chased after Osborne with unrelenting ferocity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned grave, his mind racing as he plotted their next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two Deity Overlord-level Deathborns might not have been the fastest foes Osborne had faced, but they were certainly quicker than Fabian. Even with his Thunderform Flash, he was unable to shake them off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their attacks packed quite a punch, rivaling what he had experienced from Fabian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hannah, hurry and restore your Divine Body! I can't hold off both of these Deity Overlord Deathborn on my own. If you can't regain your strength quickly, we're in serious trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah snapped back to reality, her eyes filled with gratitude as she looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! Just hang in there a moment longer. I'll recover quickly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she summoned her life power, drawing in a massive wave of vitality from the void and forcing it into her shattered Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything around them withered while Hannah's body began to heal at a remarkable rate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a powerful recovery ability! Life power truly is incredible! Aside from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, I've never seen anyone with such formidable regenerative strength before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hannah has mentioned that her mastery of life power doesn't compare to the Goddess of Life's capabilities, but that is hard to fathom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't even imagine how potent that Goddess' restoration abilities must have been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a shame that such a powerful figure has ultimately fallen at the hands of Lord Malevolence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he cradled Hannah, dodging yet another strike from the relentless Deity Overlord Deathborns, Osborne's mind raced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his current strength, he might have stood a chance against one of them, but carrying an injured Hannah while facing two? It was a battle he knew he couldn't win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, with the immense influx of vitality, Hannah's injuries were healing fast.</span></p><div class="pagination">
