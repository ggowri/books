  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What incredible power!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was slightly surprised. Although the people challenging Cuthbert couldn't make it onto the Godson Rankings, there was still a significant gap between them and Cuthbert, ranked 36th.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, it was shocking how easily Cuthbert defeated his opponents with just one move, barely exerting any effort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They were all Class AAA. Why was Cuthbert so much stronger?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd buzzed with discussion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Next!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert said calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll challenge you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Another challenger rushed onto the stage, about as strong as the previous ones. Cuthbert remained utterly calm and easily defeated him with one move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The challenges continued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seven or eight challengers went up one after another, but not a single one could withstand even one of Cuthbert's moves. They were all instantly defeated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The situation left everyone stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So powerful! No wonder he's confident about holding the Honor Quest Ceremony. With the strength he's showing, he might just achieve fifty consecutive victories!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fifty straight wins is already amazing! In over two hundred years, the Honor Quest Ceremony has been held thousands of times, but only sixty-three people have achieved fifty consecutive victories!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I think Cuthbert has a good chance!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd was excitedly discussing, astonished by Cuthbert's strength. He was nearing ten consecutive victories but hadn't appeared to expend much energy at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wasn't even trying yet. He hadn't shown his real abilities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmph, fifty straight wins?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fifty wins won't be enough for Cuthbert! His goal is eighty consecutive wins, and he might even go for ninety, or even a hundred!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just wait. When Cuthbert goes all out, he'll shock everyone!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Someone sneered as they spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd turned and saw that it was someone from the Williamson family speaking. He was also a Godson, ranked in the 300s.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing the pride on his face, the crowd frowned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ninety wins? Even a hundred?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmph! You folks are way too cocky! Are you looking down on the rest of Godsons? The challengers so far have been weaklings. Even I could beat them easily!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When we step up, the real fight begins. He might talk about a hundred straight wins if he can still beat us easily!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A hundred wins? In two hundred years, only nine people have ever done that!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't believe Cuthbert can do it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A Godson ranked in the top 300 said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's wait and see!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon after, Cuthbert easily defeated two more opponents, bringing his total to ten consecutive wins.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He still looked full of energy, completely in peak condition, with hardly any signs of energy depletion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So powerful!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma couldn't help but murmur, her expression serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He is the highest-ranked among the younger generation on the Godson Rankings. With this kind of strength, it makes sense that he'd be confident enough to hold the Honor Quest Ceremony," Osborne said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I challenge you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I challenge you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, another figure rushed onto the stage. It was Satoru Byrd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Satoru take the stage, many grew expectant. He had mastered a domain. While he had failed to break into the Godson Rankings the day before after being defeated by Samuel, his strength was not to be underestimated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Compared to Cuthbert's earlier opponents, Satoru was much stronger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Satoru knew he wasn't a match for Cuthbert. His goal was simply to last as long as possible and drain Cuthbert's energy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dark Realm!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Buzz!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without hesitation, Satoru activated his Dark Realm, enveloping Cuthbert in it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Cuthbert, use your Realm! Show me how strong it is! I want to see how wide the gap between us really is!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing this, Cuthbert smirked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is finally getting interesting, but you're not even worthy of me using my domain! Your Dark Realm is full of holes. Watch me break it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Cuthbert threw a punch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, Satoru's Dark Realm shattered like fragile glass. His face went pale as his mental strength suffered a backlash.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Satoru stared at Cuthbert in shock, but with just one more casual punch, Cuthbert sent him flying off the stage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Defeated!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite having mastered the power of a Realm, Satoru only managed to last two moves against Cuthbert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One punch shattered the Dark Realm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Another punch sent him flying out of the ring.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A total defeat!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Whoa!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd watching couldn't help but erupt into chatter, staring at Cuthbert in astonishment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was just too powerful!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it weren't for the nature of a gauntlet match, who among the younger generation could possibly defeat him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Could he really be aiming for one hundred consecutive victories?</p><div class="pagination">
