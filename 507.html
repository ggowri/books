  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you explain in detail?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression became serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The problem that Isa mentioned was something he had also noticed. In recent battles, he rarely used powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he used most was martial arts strength instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Powers seemed to have become secondary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this situation was clearly abnormal. Because it was almost universally acknowledged that a metahuman of the same level was stronger than a martial artist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only possibility was that he hadn't unleashed the true power of his abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa said calmly, "Martial arts have advanced techniques. Powers naturally do, too. However, powers need not just a technique upgrade but a more difficult level of evolution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me give you an example.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take your spatial powers, for instance. Spatial powers are among the most powerful, but do you feel their strength? What you're doing now is just tearing through space, using dimensional rifts to travel faster!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne couldn't help but nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His use of spatial powers was indeed simple and crude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial Tearing is just the basic use of spatial powers! Spatial powers have higher levels of application, like...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial Collapse!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial Collapse is an intermediate use of spatial powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There is also Spatial Domain! Domain is the advanced use of powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is said that there are ultimate applications, but those are too far off for you to know now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can learn the intermediate use of spatial powers, Spatial Collapse, you could </span><span>instantly make the space in your enemy's area collapse. The enemy wouldn't even have a chance to escape and would die immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At that time, your strength will be much greater than now. You won't just be using spatial powers to escape faster."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Isa finished speaking, Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial Tearing, Spatial Collapse, Spatial Domain? And there are even ultimate applications? Is this the correct way to use spatial powers?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, he only knew the basic applications.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's breathing became rapid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, teach me Spatial Collapse and Spatial Domain!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa rolled her eyes at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not a metahuman, and I don't have spatial powers. How can I teach you? I just know the names of the basic, intermediate, advanced, and ultimate uses of spatial powers. You'll have to figure out how to do it yourself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The intermediate use of powers is as difficult as advanced martial arts. They both enhance power. With your talent, even if no one teaches you, you should be able to learn it by exploring seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for advanced use, the domain is the only true super-geniuses who can master that. Just keep the concept in mind. When your control of powers reaches a certain level, you'll naturally gain a domain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne calmed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, he asked, "Isa, do you know the different levels of application for other powers?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa said calmly, "But they're mostly the same. Ninety-nine percent of powers are all about controlling energy. Elemental powers are energy. Mind powers are also energy. Even psychic powers are about controlling energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Intermediate application is making the controlled energy explode with greater power. For example, the intermediate application of lightning elemental is Thunder Burst!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Advanced application is Domain!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A domain can change the battlefield, making it more favorable to you, restricting the enemy's abilities, and even preventing them from drawing any power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the domain, you'll be the god!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's breathing quickened. He wanted to immediately start researching intermediate and even advanced applications of various powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he knew it would be difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne believed he could find a way to succeed in his research.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't rush!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa held back the eager Osborne. "Before you try, you need to determine your main power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Main power?" Osborne was puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa said calmly, "Everyone's energy and time are limited. Having too many powers isn't necessarily a good thing. No one can deeply research every single power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have too many powers now. You can only use them at a basic level. Against true </span><span>strong opponents, they are useless and only serve as support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you have to choose one, or two, or three powers as your main powers and focus on deep research into those.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Knowing ten powers isn't as good as mastering one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Isa finished speaking, Osborne fell into deep thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Knowing ten powers isn't as good as mastering one?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt that Isa was right. Before, he didn't know there were intermediate and advanced applications of powers, so he thought the more powers he knew, the stronger he would be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, his thinking changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could only use ten powers at a basic level, he would definitely lose miserably against someone who had mastered one power at an advanced level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He might even be killed instantly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I need to choose my main powers?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How many should I choose?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Which ones should I choose?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
