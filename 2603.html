  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel ended, but now the entire Glorious Divine Kingdom is talking about one name&mdash;Osborne!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The champion of the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The first under Empyrean Sacredness of the Glorious Divine Kingdom!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He is the strongest!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne overpowered the nine princes and princesses of the Glorious Divine Kingdom Royal Family, showcasing terrifying strength and winning the championship in an undisputed manner!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, there's also Clara and Leroy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They are joint champions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But almost everyone knows they won the championship because of Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They actually admitted the joint championship?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Clara and Leroy looked at each other, stunned by the overwhelming surprise. Not long ago, when Osborne revealed his plan to Clara and Leroy, they were utterly shocked, but they also thought the plan was absolutely impossible to succeed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I thought the Royal Family would make us have a rematch to decide the winner! Or, they would acknowledge our joint championship but only let us split the rewards for 'champion, runner-up, and third place.'"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, they didn&rsquo;t make us have a rematch?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And they actually agreed to reward each of us 20 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints? That&rsquo;s 20 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints per person!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy were utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Originally, one of them could only be the runner-up, and the other the third place, with a combined reward of only 15 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne, with a small plan, not only got them the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel championship title but also earned each of them 20 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their reward directly doubled!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, how did you know the Royal Family would agree? By all accounts, they should have made us compete again..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara was very curious at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "If they made us compete again, even better! I would make the Glorious Divine Kingdom's Royal Family lose face once more!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"For example, if we still concede to each other and refuse to decide a winner, what would the Royal Family do? Keep making us compete endlessly?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After he finished speaking, Clara and Leroy were stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then they could just split the rewards between us! No one would probably say anything about that."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's because you don't understand the Royal Family! To the Royal Family, the Kingdom Duel Scorepoints they reward us are just numbers! A little more or less makes no big difference to them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If they act stingy, they'll only be ridiculed. To them, saving face is everything! They've already lost enough face today and won't let it happen again over something like this..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The most important thing is..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne glanced in Frederick's direction and calmly said, "I'm just testing them! Even if they let us split the rewards, we wouldn't lose, right? Plus, you two would gain an extra championship title!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy nodded at those words, completely convinced by Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, they looked at the Kingdom Duel Badge with 24 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, incredibly excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, when can we enter the Glorious Divine Kingdom's treasury? I can't wait to exchange treasures with the Kingdom Duel Scorepoints!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "Tomorrow!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's already late, and the Glorious Sacrificial Ceremony is over! Let's go, we'll head back to the hotel first. Tomorrow, someone will take us to the Glorious Divine Kingdom's treasury!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne followed the crowd and walked out of the Royal Sepulcher.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, everything had gone just as he planned&mdash;except for the one thing he couldn't accomplish: paying tribute to Michelle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom lost all their face!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The nine princes and princesses not only failed to win the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel but didn't even make it to the top three.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne could still feel the malice emanating from those Royal Family members.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne didn't care.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, he is the center of attention in the entire Glorious Divine Kingdom. If something happens to him at this time, even a fool would know it must have been done by the Royal Family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt that at least within the scope of Nebula City, the Royal Family wouldn't make a move against him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And during this time, he wouldn't leave Nebula City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At least before entering Necropolis City, he definitely wouldn't leave. And by the time he comes out of Necropolis City, he will surely have broken through to Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, if the Royal Family wants to make a move on him, he won't be afraid.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing that Osborne and the other two were about to leave the Royal Sepulcher.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, a pale figure blocked Osborne's path.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was Seraphina!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina glared angrily at Osborne, gritting her teeth, her eyes filled with a frenzy of killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne calmly met her gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina's injuries were still severe, but her legs had already been reattached, which was nothing for the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even such severe injuries of hers could heal within a day or two.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But even if Seraphina recovered, Osborne still wouldn't fear her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He simply said calmly, "What? Not letting me leave? Did I win the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, and the Royal Family won't allow me to go? Want to keep me here? Take my life?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina snorted coldly at his words, "Osborne, rest assured, I lost, and I admit it! The Royal Family will absolutely not lay a hand on you! Although I don't know why Queen Callista ordered all Royal Family members not to retaliate against you, or else be exiled from the Palace..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was instantly surprised upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista actually ordered all Royal Family members not to retaliate against them?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Or be exiled from the Palace?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned. Based on his understanding of Callista, such an order was absolutely unreasonable. Callista was someone who held grudges; how could she possibly issue such an order?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista would love to skin him alive!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, this order wasn&rsquo;t given by Callista, but by someone else. Callista was just the messenger...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne's heart stirred.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The only person in the entire Glorious Divine Kingdom who could have Callista deliver a message was his father from his previous life...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emperor Frederick!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Why would Emperor Frederick give such an order? Even if he doesn't care about the Royal Family's honor, he shouldn't stop others from taking revenge on me. With his personality that only cares about increasing strength and nothing else, how could he meddle in such matters? So, there's only one possibility... That is, I am of great use to Emperor Frederick! That's why he doesn't want anything to happen to me. He sees me as valuable! Until my value is fully exploited, he won't allow anyone to touch me... And what he cares about most right now should be Necropolis City..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Osborne figured out a lot, a cold glint flashing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said calmly, "Since Callista has already ordered all of you not to take revenge on us, why are you still coming to me? I have no interest in defeated opponents."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina became even angrier upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She clenched her fists and said, "Osborne, don't get too smug! You just beat me once for now! Once I break through to Empyrean Sacredness, I'll take everything back! By then, I'll crush you effortlessly!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Perhaps you don't know, I could have broken through to Empyrean Sacredness a hundred years ago, right? I suppressed my cultivation level for a century... And during this century, the power I cultivated has been stored in a special container!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Once I break through to Empyrean Sacredness, I won't just become a primary Empyrean Sacredness but will directly reach mid Empyrean Sacredness!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, I'll crush you effortlessly!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, I'm just here to tell you, wait for me! Soon, I'll take back all the glory I lost from you!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
