  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen's screams echoed, causing the expressions of everyone in the Augustine family to change drastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They fought the stinging pain in their eyes, trying to see what had happened. But even with Satan's Eye activated, all they saw was a blinding white light, obscuring everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All they could feel was the terrifying power contained within those rays of light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dissolving Light!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma shouted, her voice echoing through the arena, "It was an Intermediate Level light elemental power! Stop this fight! The Augustine family concedes the first match."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Emma waved her hand, releasing a surge of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a loud bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a figure stumbled out from the intense light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Owen!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strange, crater-like wound now marred Owen's shoulder. The flesh within the wound seemed to have been vaporized and dissolved, leaving a ghastly white patch with no blood flowing out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't appear to be too serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the intense light gradually faded as Emma admitted defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon reappeared in everyone's sight. He glanced at Owen with disdain before immediately turning his attention to Emma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Interesting!" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To be able to rescue someone from my Dissolving Light, it seems you're much stronger than him. I wonder how many moves you can last against me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma snorted coldly, "You'll find out soon enough how many moves I can last!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then looked at Owen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take him for treatment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Owen had recovered considerably. His face was dark and menacing. Hearing Emma's words, he roared, "Emma, what right do you have to concede for me? I haven't lost yet! I was just playing possum. Who told you to rush to concede? Your concession cost the Augustines the first round. You're responsible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you afraid of me stealing the spotlight, so you deliberately conceded?" Owen bellowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's face was filled with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many members of the Augustine family looked at Emma with confusion. In the bright light, they couldn't see what had happened. But now it seemed that Owen's injuries weren't too severe, at least not serious enough for him to concede, much less life-threatening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why was Emma so quick to concede for Owen?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was she really worried about Owen stealing the spotlight?" they wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Emma, you've gone too far! I could have won this fight. I pretended not to know his power, trying to lure him into my trap, but you exposed my plan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen continued shouting, "Then, I feigned weakness again, even pretending to be injured, just waiting for him to let his guard down so I could strike and defeat him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you conceded for me in advance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen said with a look of anger as if he had indeed been wronged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon watched the scene with amusement, not bothering to explain to Emma as if he was enjoying the show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's face was extremely unsightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Idiot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cursed at Owen, too lazy to pay him any attention. She strode towards Gordon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen, scolded and then ignored by Emma, felt a surge of anger. He couldn't hold back and shouted, "Emma, I've been eliminated because of your mistake! If you can't win next, you'll be the sinner of the Augustine family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did he return to his seat, his face dark and gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma still paid him no mind, her eyes fixed on Gordon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Light elemental power, not bad, but in your hands, it's only good enough to beat fools like Owen. It's useless against me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon raised an eyebrow. "You're pretty confident."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's lips curled into a smirk. "Against an opponent like you, I have no reason not to be. My confidence comes from your weakness. The tenth Godson of Yalynch? Because of you, I'm a little disappointed in Yalynch's Godsons."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon's face darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Arrogant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who do you think you are, looking down on Yalynch's Godsons? If I'm not mistaken, you're only twenty-five this year, right? Haha, I hope you're not all talk!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Gordon suddenly struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Intermediate Light Elemental Technique - Dissolving Light!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying burst of light erupted, causing everyone's eyes to sting. They could barely see anything, only an ominous beam of light shooting towards Emma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family's faces changed drastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just now, Gordon had used this move to dissolve a piece of flesh from Owen's shoulder, causing Owen to scream in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Owen claimed he had deliberately weakened himself and gotten injured to make Gordon lower his guard, everyone in the Augustine family knew how terrifying this move was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the intermediate application of any power is not to be underestimated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The same goes for light elemental power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A beam of light coalesced and shot toward Emma, emitting a strange sound as it threatened to pierce her body and draw blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, Emma finally moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a casual wave of her hand, a thick layer of ice suddenly appeared before her. The ice, shaped peculiarly, resembled a bizarre mirror. The surrounding temperature instantly plummeted to an extreme, as if an ice cave had formed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your attack is useless against me!" Emma said coldly as the Dissolving Light struck the ice barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ice began to melt instantly, but it quickly regenerated, maintaining its solidity. It even deflected most of the incoming light in other directions while a portion was reflected toward Gordon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon's expression changed drastically upon seeing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ice elemental power!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
