  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three people behind Evelynn, including Charlie, were looking at Osborne with sneers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They also believed that Osborne would definitely agree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn, a descendant of Newport City's Augustine family, was a friend worth dreaming about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was more, they couldn't keep the Fate Staff no matter what.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne voluntarily handed over the Fate Staff, he could get two billion dollars and gain Evelynn's friendship. But if not, not only would he lose the money, but he would also gain Evelynn's hatred and become an enemy of the Augustine family in Newport City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a fool wouldn't make a mistake in this multiple-choice question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne chose not.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Evelynn with disdain and said, "Descendant of the Augustine family in Newport City? Are you so shameless? You want to buy a divine artifact for two billion? It's a robbery! </span><span>So</span><span> don't act like you are generous, okay?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll give you 20 billion, and you give me a divine artifact in exchange. Deal?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, who would want to be friends with you? Is it prestigious to be your friend? Yet I find it embarrassing. If you were not born in the Augustine family in Newport City, you would have been beaten to death long ago, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was stunned by Osborne's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn stood there. Her pride vanished, her expression turning dark with anger quickly creeping onto her pretty face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you scold me?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn clenched her fists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd behind her was surprised, too. They hadn't anticipated that Osborne would not only refuse to surrender the scepter but also rudely mock Evelynn upon learning her identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he not afraid of death?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Wade were also taken aback, but soon, surprise appeared in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their opinion, Evelynn would never forgive Osborne since he insulted her like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Evelynn killed Osborne, they got saved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan and Eugen were shocked upon learning Evelynn's identity and even tried to convince Clarissa to surrender the scepter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, although divine artifacts were precious, life mattered more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family of Newport City was the most influential ancient family in </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>. Even the Radcliffe family getting 100 times stronger couldn't match it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they didn't expect Osborne actually to refuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Evelynn's face turn cold, they were both frightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, no! Osborne, that bastard! He'll get himself and Clarissa killed! Even the Radcliffe family might be dragged down by him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, both of them were incredibly mad at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne ignored the shocked crowd, just turned his head, and looked at Clarissa's pale face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, will you blame me for doing so?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa bit her lip, her eyes a little flustered, but she was soon determined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I won't! No matter what choice you make, you must have your reasons. I won't blame you. I will shoulder the responsibility with you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you become the enemy of the Augustine family in Newport City, I will always stand with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Clarissa's words, Osborne was instantly moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa didn't know that he was actually Godfather's grandson, so he didn't care about Evelynn's identity at all and dared to insult her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Clarissa's eyes, Osborne was destined to become the enemy of the Augustine family by doing so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she still chose to confront everything together with Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he find such a good woman?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne held Clarissa's hand tightly and nodded. "Okay! Then we will bear it together. The Fate Staff is yours, and no one can take it away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he turned and looked at Evelynn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stated coldly, "Evelynn, right? Who gave you the confidence that you are superior to others? Not only will I scold you today, but I will also teach you a lesson!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember, don't bother with other people's things! Otherwise, you'll be beaten. Even your brother Owen, the Augustine family in Newport City, and even Godfather can't protect you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, Evelynn became even angrier, her body trembling violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She screamed, unable to bear it any longer. Her left eye suddenly burst into light, activating the inherited power of the Augustine family, Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five white stars twinkled in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Satan's Eye!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne grew vigilant as Evelynn opened Satan's Eye, aware of the formidable challenge she presented as a fellow bearer of Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The stars of her Satan's Eye are white, which is different from mine. It seems that my Satan's Eye has indeed mutated. But how much of a difference is there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought so, and Evelynn had taken action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to kill you! How dare you insult me? No one can save you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A burst of orange energy burst out from Evelynn's body and quickly blasted towards Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Devil's Light!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The orange Devil's Light, also known as the second-level Devil's Light, was formed by the fusion of three elemental essences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, Evelynn used Satan's Eye to devour at least three elemental essences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only three ones?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sneer appeared on Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had devoured the seven elemental essences and fused them into the sixth-level Devil's Light!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn tried to use the second-level orange Devil's Light to rival him?</span></p><div class="pagination">
