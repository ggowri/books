  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression shifted drastically as he felt the urge to tear open a dimensional rift and escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at that moment, his face turned pale, and he vomited blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had exhausted too much mental energy from continuously using spatial manipulation, leaving him unable to open a rift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His situation grew dire as Duke Medusa approached with terrifying speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes glowed with a chilling light, and the petrifying effect began to stiffen Osborne's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting his teeth, he waved his hand again, pushing through the pain to expend the last of his spiritual energy and open a dimensional rift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Puff!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He coughed up more blood, nearly fainting from the strain, but he knew he could not succumb to unconsciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Death awaited him if he did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Escape!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped into the rift, disappearing just as Duke Medusa arrived at his last location, her gaze filled with frenzied killing intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll see how long you can keep escaping! Although spatial power is powerful, it also consumes a lot of mental energy. You can't use them all the time. Once I catch you, I'll turn you into a beautiful statue!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she resumed her pursuit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Puff!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thirty miles away, Osborne spat out blood again, and his body walked out of the dimensional rift with a pale face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wiped his mouth, his expression grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't keep this up! My spiritual power is depleted, and I can't perform interdimensional travel or counter the petrification effect!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did Duke Medusa catch up so quickly? Does she have a way to track me? I've fled 30 miles!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's brows were tightly furrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he didn't resolve this, Duke Medusa would catch up again. By then, he would no longer be able to escape through interdimensional travel and would be completely petrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to recover my spiritual energy fast! If she catches me again, I won't be able to escape."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mood darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he quickly regain his spiritual energy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Spiritual energy, essential for his power, was like a pool of water. Once drained, recovery took time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stronger a person's soul was, the stronger their spiritual energy was, the larger the pool that stored spiritual energy was, the faster their ability to recover was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's soul and spiritual energy were extremely powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were stronger than anyone else in his realm. Even those psychic metahumans were not as strong as him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under normal circumstances, Osborne's spiritual energy was enough to fight for a long time without feeling tired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the spatial power consumed too much spiritual energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The solid nature of spatial required significant energy to alter. Osborne stretched and folded the spatial successively and used interdimensional travel to escape. Despite his strength, he had exhausted his reserves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And with the speed of spiritual energy recovered, it was simply too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Duke Medusa likely to close within minutes, he needed a new strategy to recover faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First, I must escape!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't dare to stay any longer and dove into the jungle, brainstorming as he fled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, an idea struck him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absorbing star power can enhance my soul and body. Maybe it also can enhance my spiritual energy! I could recover it while escaping!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne tried it immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As night fell, he noticed the flickering star power above. Activating his Satan's Eyes, he began to absorb star power, feeling his spiritual energy replenishing rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's working! If I keep this up, I can recover enough spiritual energy to perform interdimensional travel in two minutes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne felt much more relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a fresh wave of danger hit him, and his expression changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can she catch up so fast?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized Duke Medusa must have a way to lock onto his position continuously. Otherwise, she could not catch up so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be the wound on my back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face paled. "That wound is from Duke Medusa. Remnants of her power might be allowing her to lock onto my position!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is troublesome!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
