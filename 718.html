  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about it? Is that request too much?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can absolutely do it! It'll be a piece of cake, and there's no way it's illegal or anything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She finished, but beneath her fiery gaze, a flicker of nervousness and shyness danced in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback, his mouth falling open in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never expected Emma to make such a bold request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Help Emma unlock Satan's Eye?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne still didn't grasp what Emma meant at this point, he'd be a fool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recalled what his Godfather had told him long ago. The descendants of the Augustine family would unlock Satan's Eye during their first intimate encounter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, to activate it, they needed to engage in a physical relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His own Satan's Eye had awakened after he and Ophelia had taken their relationship to the next level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why hadn't Emma unlocked hers yet?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that she couldn't; it was that she couldn't accept the method. She was proud, believing no man was worthy of her, no one deserving of sharing such an intimate bond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd rather remain pure than let just anyone into her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then Emma met Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was close to her age, yet stronger than she was. Even after her breakthrough to Class AAA, Emma didn't have complete confidence in defeating him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, it clicked for Emma. If it was Osborne who helped her unlock Satan's Eye, she could accept that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, she wanted it more than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without Satan's Eye, she was already the most talented among the younger generation of the Augustine family. After breaking through to Class AAA, she didn't even regard Vincent, who was also Class AAA, as a threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, if Emma could unlock Satan's Eye, her strength would increase even further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze was unwavering as she looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help me unlock Satan's Eye! That's my request!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath, a frown creasing his brow. "No way! You need to come up with another request."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's expression shifted to one of urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why not? Are you unwilling? Am I not good enough? I know I'm not as pretty as your girlfriend Clarissa, and I don't have her talent or her gentle nature. I'm not as understanding, and I certainly don't know how to love someone the way she does.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I'm not bad, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not asking you to fall in love with me or to give up Clarissa for me. I'm asking for one thing: help me unlock Satan's Eye!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you turning me down? Am I really that unappealing to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's voice was tinged with desperation and hurt, her eyes searching Osborne's for an answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne struggled for words, his expression pained. "It's not about that! You're great! You're beautiful, you have a fantastic figure, and your talent is off the charts. If you wanted, countless guys would line up to help you unlock Satan's Eye."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma said, "But I can't stand the thought of them touching me! The very idea makes me sick! I'd rather die than let them into my body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I only have eyes for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma stepped closer, her face inches from his, tilting her chin up to meet his gaze with unwavering determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was left speechless, still shaking his head. "No! I can't do that. I have a girlfriend!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't care!" Emma shot back, her voice fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, his teeth clenched, "I have more than one girlfriend! I'm not the kind of guy who deserves you. You deserve someone better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's face lit up with a mischievous grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, that's even better! Since you already have more than one girlfriend, adding me to the mix shouldn't be a big deal, right? Or do you think I'm worse than all your other girlfriends? Am I not worthy of being with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Emma moved closer, pressing her body against Osborne's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne instinctively leaned back, his senses overwhelmed by the scent of Emma and the quickening of her breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, frowning, "It's not like that. We don't have any emotional foundation. We..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, we'll have one after!" Emma interrupted boldly, her cheeks suddenly flushing deep red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her embarrassment, she was determined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're the only man I've ever met in my life that I don't dislike. I don't mind if you enter my body, so you absolutely must help me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I risked my life to help you! I almost died here, with over a hundred serious, almost fatal wounds on my body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You yourself said you owe me a big favor, and you promised that you'd help as long as it was within your power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I'm holding you to that promise!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help me unlock Satan's Eye!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right here, right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Emma suddenly peeled off her top, revealing her perfectly sculpted figure.</span></p><div class="pagination">
