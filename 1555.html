  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At Osborne's command, a figure shot out from the estate like a bolt of lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was Darren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, he launched himself at Gilbert and Fabian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His speed was extraordinary&mdash;so fast that neither of them could react in time. They hadn't expected such a powerful presence to be hiding within the estate, leaving them completely unprepared to dodge his attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, two dull thuds echoed through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd watched in shock as Fabian and Gilbert were sent spiraling backward, blood spraying from their mouths before they crashed heavily to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, a profound silence enveloped the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone stood rooted to the spot, stunned by the sudden turn of events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fabian and Gilbert&mdash;both Deity Overlord level warriors&mdash;had just been taken down in one strike!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seemed quite impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Spectators from both the Wolfe and Keynes families, along with the various factions observing from a distance, looked on in disbelief, their eyes turning towards the masked figure of Darren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were desperate to uncover the identity of someone capable of injuring both Fabian and Gilbert with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such a warrior was a rarity in Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But their curiosity quickly turned into disappointment; with Darren's face concealed behind a mask, his identity was hidden from view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, they could feel the divine power radiating from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A late-stage Deity Overlord warrior!" came an astonished shout from the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The realization spread like wildfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once one reached the realm of Deity Overlord, each minor realm advancement became exceedingly difficult. For most geniuses, reaching the Deity Overlord level often exhausted their physical potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under such circumstances, even the slightest improvement became incredibly challenging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For Darren to be a late-stage Deity Overlord meant he was in a different league entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This gap in power explained how he could so effortlessly injure Fabian and Gilbert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While they were also Deity Overlord warriors, they were merely early-stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although they, like Darren, were all Deity Overlords, there was a two-step difference in their realms. Below the realm of Deity Overlord, such a gap in two small realms might not seem significant, and many geniuses could easily bridge this gap and engage in inter-realm challenges.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, within the realm of Deity Overlord, a difference of two small realms represented two entirely separate levels of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, Darren's attack came unexpectedly, like a sneak attack, which made it all the more likely for Fabian and Gilbert to be seriously injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd buzzed with shocked whispers, their faces grave. "A late-stage Deity Overlord warrior! Unbelievable! How does this lowly human's Spark of Blaze have a late-stage Deity Overlord on its side?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With a warrior like that backing them, they could establish themselves firmly in Wild Flame City! Even the second-tier forces wouldn't dare to provoke them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"For third-rate factions like the Wolfe and Keynes families to pick a fight with someone protected by a late-stage Deity Overlord? That's just asking for trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fabian and Gilbert are finished!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among the onlookers, Calvin's face darkened, his expression grim as he watched Osborne and Darren in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A late-stage Deity Overlord? How is this possible? Where in the hell did that little punk find such a powerful ally? Even Dad is just a mid-stage Deity Overlord!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His fists clenched tightly, anger boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Fabian and Gilbert slowly picked themselves up, panic evident in their eyes as they faced Darren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who the hell are you? Why would you help this lowly human? And why are you wearing a mask? Are you too afraid to show your face?" Fabian hissed through gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darren let out a cold snort, ignoring Fabian and instead focusing on Osborne, waiting for his next command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled, "Fabian, weren't you just a little too cocky earlier? Look at you now, all flustered and beaten up. Oh dear, are you hurt? You seem close to death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fabian's face twisted with rage as he shot a glare at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You pathetic human! You managed to cozy up to a late-stage Deity Overlord warrior, huh? No wonder you're so full of yourself! Let's call it even today. I'll forget all this, and I'll take my people and leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gilbert quickly chimed in, "And we'll let bygones be bygones regarding Kerwin. I'll get the Keynes family out of here right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, the two turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne scoffed, disdain dripping from his words. "You think a simple 'let's forget this' is enough? You really think you can just walk away? That's rich! After trying to kill me and laying siege to Spark Estate for two days, you think you can just leave without consequences?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I warned you&mdash;once you choose to stand against me and Spark of Blaze, you better be ready to face annihilation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You two, along with the Wolfe family and the Keynes family... you're all marked for extinction!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a swift motion, Osborne raised his hand. "Darren, finish them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darren grinned as he approached Fabian and Gilbert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two men's faces drained of color, panic setting in as they shouted, "Stop! You can't kill us!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
