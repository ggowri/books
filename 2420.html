  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For Osborne, dealing with Bloody Ivy was even easier than handling </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moths.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The most powerful aspect of Bloody Ivy is their ability to hide deep in the desert, conceal their presence, and silently appear beneath their prey to launch an ambush.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once prey is entangled by Bloody Ivy, it's hard to break free. The sharp thorns on Bloody Ivy also release a toxin that paralyzes the prey.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Leroy and Clara found it hard to detect the hidden Bloody Ivy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They previously used the most direct method, which was to use themselves as bait to lure Bloody Ivy into attacking. After defending against Bloody Ivy's attack with the Sacred Artifact, they would counter and kill it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But for Osborne, it wasn&rsquo;t that troublesome.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For Osborne, who possesses Satan's Eye, no matter how deeply Bloody Ivy hides or how well it conceals its presence, it cannot escape his sight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He can spot Bloody Ivy from afar.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bloody Ivy has no chance to silently approach Osborne for a sneak attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A loud bang.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sacred Power Arrow scattered, targeting the Bloody Ivy deep in the desert, effortlessly shattering their energy cores and turning them into lifeless ordinary vines.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For them, the hardest part was digging out its main body from the desert, but this still couldn't stump Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His Satan's Eye released a beam of ocular energy, enveloping the Bloody Ivy, and in the next second, they were all absorbed into the Satan Space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, these Bloody Ivy still need some handling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These tasks were handed over to Clara and Leroy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne continued using Satan's Eye to search for large groups of prey nearby.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, all the native creatures of Abyssal, under the command of the Magma Devourer, were rushing here madly to surround and kill the contestants, so Osborne had no shortage of prey.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he encountered smaller prey, Osborne couldn't be bothered to act and let them attack the contestant teams. After all, with Brenda around, these native creatures posed no real danger and would eventually turn into Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> for Brenda and the others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne only targeted the larger native creatures.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If many native creatures appeared at once, he would only pick the easiest and most valuable ones to deal with.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In such situations, their spoils of war kept increasing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Clara and Leroy were a bit overwhelmed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After many native creatures were killed, they needed to be processed to collect resources exchangeable for Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>. Osborne's killing speed was simply too fast.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy couldn't even keep up with processing the corpses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their processing speed couldn't keep up with Osborne's killing speed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were both happy and helpless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, the other contestant teams were also constantly fighting. Native creatures came from all directions, and it was naturally impossible for Osborne and his team to kill them all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So</span><span> the other contestant teams still had to face many native creatures.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But their condition had completely stabilized by now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under Brenda's command, groups of native creatures were killed by them, becoming their spoils. These spoils would eventually be distributed based on their individual performance and contributions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the commander, Brenda naturally received the most spoils.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the crowd finally had some time to rest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I never thought that once we united, these native creatures would be so easy to handle! Plus, we actually turned misfortune into a blessing. Normally, we wouldn't encounter so many native creatures or gain so many spoils..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"These spoils can all be exchanged for Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Based on the gains during this time, each of us can get at least 200,000 Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> worth of spoils! And this is just after half a day. If we keep this up, by the end of the zone duel, won't each of us have millions, or even tens of millions, of Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> worth of spoils?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone immediately became excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After overcoming the initial danger and panic, they were now thinking about how to gain more spoils and exchange them for more Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Haha, we hit the jackpot this time!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, Brenda definitely earned the most! With her contributions, the spoils she gets are at least ten times more than us regular members, maybe even more! If everything goes smoothly, by the end of the zone duel, she could earn at least hundreds of millions of Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Brenda will definitely become the champion!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Definitely!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I heard that because Valentino was overconfident, he was already killed by the Magma Devourer! They say he was crushed to death by it, really tragic!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With Valentino dead, no one can threaten Brenda anymore! She's definitely the champion, there's no way anyone can challenge her!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I really envy her..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Brenda won the championship with strength and strategy! Why couldn't others unite everyone? Only she could?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Brenda deserves the championship!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Anyone but Brenda winning the championship, I won't accept!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Exactly!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not far away, Brenda heard the crowd's chatter and smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She also felt she was sure to win the championship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Valentino was trampled to death by the Magma Devourer, no one could threaten her anymore. And this time, uniting all the contestants completely gave her control over the championship race.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other championship contenders now all have to follow Brenda's lead! Although they are all trying their best to perform and earn more loot through contribution points, they definitely can't surpass her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She gained the most loot, even more than everyone had guessed!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda thought, "This championship is definitely mine! But now is not the time to celebrate, I must lead everyone to survive, only then will it be perfect!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Next, there will definitely be more native creatures coming to hunt us down! I must perform even better!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda stood up and said, "Has everyone rested well? We're preparing to set off immediately. Once we leave this desert and enter the northern glacier region, we'll be safe! By then, we can hunt these native creatures better and earn more Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"While the number of native creatures is still low, let's keep moving forward!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes!" Everyone obeyed and continued heading north.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda walked at the front, immediately taking action to kill any native creatures she encountered, as this was the only way to earn more loot through contributions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, she faintly felt that something was off...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The number of native creatures attacking us hasn't increased but has actually decreased? How strange..." Muttering to herself, Brenda scanned the surroundings with her Golden Dragon Eye but found nothing unusual. She could only shake her head and stop overthinking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What she didn't know was that outside the range of her Golden Dragon Eye's vision, Osborne, along with Clara and Leroy, was riding on Flash, frantically slaughtering groups of native creatures...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The contestants led by Brenda were more like bait for Osborne. They gathered together, attracting more native creatures, most of which were intercepted and killed by him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
