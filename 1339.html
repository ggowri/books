  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battlefield fell into stunned silence as Osborne effortlessly annihilated over thirty Superior Deities from Lord League in a single attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every witness was left in shock, unable to comprehend what they had just witnessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Apocalypse Harbinger, with all his power, could not achieve such a level of destruction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the face of a coordinated assault from over thirty Superior Deities, a typical Transcendent Deity warrior would be forced to retreat, and even the mightiest among them would find it nearly impossible to eliminate such a formidable group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To wipe out so many with a single strike?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was unthinkable&mdash;unless they weren't defending themselves at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne had done just that, shattering their defenses and transforming their bodies into a gruesome mist of blood in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer display of power was terrifying, leaving everyone dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne himself remained eerily calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they only knew that he hadn't even unleashed his full strength yet, their astonishment would only grow deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He must die!" Apocalypse Harbinger's voice sliced through the air, cold and resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until now, he had viewed the battle with a detached air, a high-and-mighty spectator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the situation had shifted, and urgency crept into his demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With less than twenty Transcendent Deity warriors left in Lord League, the remaining forces clearly lacked the firepower needed to take Osborne down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear had taken root in the hearts of the remaining warriors, leaving them paralyzed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, if Osborne found himself in real danger, the ten or so warriors from the Prophet Alliance would surely intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing this, Apocalypse Harbinger turned his gaze to Emperor Dare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Emperor Dare, your people excel in assassination. I want you to send your best to launch a decisive strike. We need him alive&mdash;there's no doubt he possesses secrets that could be worth their weight in gold. I want him captured so we can extract whatever knowledge he has."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emperor Dare nodded solemnly, understanding the gravity of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rest assured, Esteemed Apocalypse Harbinger. I will take care of it personally, leading my people to capture him alive! He may be strong, but he cannot hope to match the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization. Soon, he will bow before you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a determined glint in his eye, Emperor Dare sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alongside him were nearly a hundred assassins from the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, all vanishing from sight in an instant, slipping into stealth mode. They closed in on Osborne from all directions, poised to deliver a lethal blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, watch out! The </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization has launched a surprise attack!" Eddie shouted, snapping back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was as astonished as the others by Osborne's devastating display, but he hadn't lost sight of their enemies, Apocalypse Harbinger, Nelson, and Emperor Dare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Emperor Dare and the killers disappear from view, Eddie instantly realized they were going into stealth to ambush Osborne. He rushed to warn Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne merely smiled, "Thanks for the heads-up; I've got it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he charged toward the remaining warriors of Lord League, seeming completely unconcerned about the impending ambush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This bold move sent Eddie into a tizzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to help Osborne, but he also had to be wary of the lurking assassins from the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Defend!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warriors from the Prophet Alliance gathered anxiously, their senses heightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But their efforts were ultimately futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The assassins from the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization had no interest in targeting them; all their focus was on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Osborne was keeping the remaining Transcendent Deities of Lord League on the defensive, chaos reigned among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrified by the sheer might of his abilities, they had abandoned any thoughts of a counteroffensive. Instead, they huddled together, nervously attempting to shield themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if Osborne was single-handedly laying siege to the remaining forces of Lord League.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, curiously, their strategy of collective defense seemed to be having some effect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least for now, it seemed Osborne couldn't easily dispatch them. A dozen Transcendent Deities banded together was no trifling matter, even for someone as formidable as Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, he couldn't afford to act rashly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though it looked like he was focusing on attacking the assembled Transcendent Deities of the Lord League, his primary concern was actually the assassins from the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their Stealth Arts were formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne could see through them, and he felt the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization's leader, Emperor Dare, stealthily creeping within 164 feet of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This proximity gave Osborne the confidence to instantly wipe out Emperor Dare, but he didn't strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was waiting for more assassins to close in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emperor Dare, too, refrained from launching his attack. The prowess Osborne demonstrated made him wary of an immediate assault&mdash;he needed more of his assassins within striking distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emperor Dare glared at Osborne, his eyes blazing with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Our Stealth Arts are peerless, even in the Age of Gods! Your cultivation can't possibly surpass mine, so you can't see through me! Boy, your fate is sealed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing that enough of his assassins were in position, Emperor Dare signaled the attack using a special technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he unleashed his fury.</span></p><div class="pagination">
