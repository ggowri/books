  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly after, Caleb hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>What's happened? Did he really kill five Class AAA fighters from the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>? How did he manage to do it?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did Osborne find a powerful ally? Is it possible that the Godfather is secretly helping him?" Janet hurriedly asked, with a furrowed brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the Godfather sent a </span><span>top Class AAA</span><span> expert to help Osborne gain points, it would </span><span>be a bit unfair to others.</span><span>"</span><span> Caleb shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It has nothing to do with the Godfather. Osborne indeed killed five Class AAA fighters from the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> and found a strong support, his girlfriend, Clarissa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa? The </span><span>Fatebearer</span><span> of the Radcliffe family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janet was astonished. "But she isn&rsquo;t that powerful, right? How could she help Osborne kill five Class AAA fighters from the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>? Even if you and I joined forces, we wouldn't be able to do it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb shook his head. "I don't know either."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Osborne said that Clarissa has already reached Class AA and is close to reaching Class AAA. As the </span><span>Fatebearer</span><span>, she possesses unique abilities, so perhaps it's possible," Caleb explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They are on their way back now. When they're here, you can ask them yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb then sat down again, but his fingers were trembling slightly due to excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never expected this kid actually to achieve it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I joined his team because I saw his potential, but I never thought he would reach the top three on the scoreboard, let alone first place. And yet, he did it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's impressive! He's truly worthy of being the Godfather's biological grandson. Perhaps we will witness the rise of a new miracle just like decades ago! Maybe a new Godfather will soon emerge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb was extremely excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, everyone at the headquarters in Campbell received the good news and became elated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the war with the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> began, Osborne's position on the points scoreboard mainly had been at the bottom, so those who were part of Osborne's team felt frustrated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Osborne had taken the top spot on the scoreboard!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all felt a sense of pride and accomplishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two hours later, Osborne finally arrived at the Draco Group headquarters in Campbell, holding hands with Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb, Janet, Isaac, No. 1, and others were waiting at the entrance to greet them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their gaze fell upon Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blushing, Clarissa hid behind Osborne as he introduced her to everyone. They then walked into the headquarters together, surrounded by the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, well done!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb patted Osborne's shoulder. "This time, you have truly made a name for yourself! However, don't get too proud. The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> won't simply give up after such a setback."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You may face their strongest counterattack next!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Rest assured, I will be cautious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb nodded and continued, "What are your plans next? Although you are temporarily at the top of the scoreboard, your competitors won't sit idly by. They will surely try to catch up, and maintaining your position won't be easy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly. "Don't worry. I will secure the first place on the scoreboard. No one can take it away from me! After resting for two days, I plan to launch a </span><span>counterattack on </span><span>Dampston</span><span> and reclaim the </span><span>Dampston</span><span> headquarters and all the rare metal mining areas."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's words made Caleb's expression turn serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>You want to launch a counterattack on </span><span>Dampston</span><span>? That won't be easy!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Especially in the several rare metal mining areas, I heard that the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> deployed many defense personnel there. Matthew and Vincent have organized counterattacks in the past, but they all failed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> seems to be frantically excavating these rare metal mines!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raising an eyebrow, Osborne expressed his surprise. "The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> is frantically excavating the rare metal mines? Why did they launch this war?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Initially, I thought they wanted to occupy the underground world of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>, defeat the Godfather, and then take control of the country. But now it seems that their intentions may not be so straightforward. Otherwise, they would have attacked the inland states long ago..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly realized that this war launched by the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> was somewhat unusual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rare metal mines, you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't get the hang of their purpose.</span><span> So, he decided not to dwell on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, the sooner this war ended, the better. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he was already in first place on the scoreboard, and he wished for the war to be over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for what the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> were planning, that was the problem for the Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne issued the order to launch the counterattack two days later, he led Clarissa to their residence, ready to rest for two days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle against Duke Medusa and others had consumed a lot of his energy, and he needed to reflect on the battle and identify areas for improvement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The headquarters of Draco Group in Campbell was huge, but Osborne's residence was located within a small courtyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After closing the door of the courtyard, Osborne wanted to pull Clarissa into the room.</span></p><div class="pagination">
