  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was confident he could find more Bewitching Lanterns. This wasn't blind confidence. It was the miraculous effects of Satan's Eye, shown time and again, that built his self-assurance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those Bewitching Lanterns were placed in remote locations within the Phantomagic Realm, protected by peculiar energy shields. Others couldn't see them or sense their energy fluctuations at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if others accidentally got close to those Bewitching Lanterns, as long as they didn't touch them, they wouldn't notice anything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In such circumstances, these Bewitching Lanterns are very safe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, unfortunately, Osborne's Satan's Eye could see those Bewitching Lanterns.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne could not only see them but also notice the extraordinary details, as each Bewitching Lantern was lit, emitting a pink glow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the dim Phantomagic Realm, those pink glows appeared as dazzling as the sun in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne could quickly spot that pink glow from a great distance using Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne quickly found the second Bewitching Lantern.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The branches of the Warfare Ancient Tree spread out from the void. Just like before, they wrapped around the Bewitching Lantern, quickly leaving Osborne's Soulbrand on it and loosening the demonic cultivator's Soulbrand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In just one minute, the entire process was complete.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sitting on Flash's back, Osborne had Flash carry him swiftly through the Phantomagic Realm, constantly using Satan's Eye to search for the Bewitching Lantern.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The third Bewitching Lantern, the fourth Bewitching Lantern, the fifth Bewitching Lantern...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took only one day to find nine Bewitching Lanterns. At this point, there were eleven days left until the Phantomagic Realm disappeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Time should be enough," Osborne murmured. "That demonic cultivator still holds a total of ninety-eight Bewitching Lanterns. Now, I've found nine. I already own one, which I've placed in a corner, continuously absorbing the power of the Phantomagic Realm."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, I've already controlled ten Bewitching Lanterns, more than one-tenth of the total. I still have eleven days, which should be enough to find all the Bewitching Lanterns and leave my Soulbrand on them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne continued to act.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He first searched the remote places. After five days, Osborne had found a total of sixty-four Bewitching Lanterns. This number was slightly more than he had expected.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne felt a sense of urgency at this moment because he noticed the power of the Phantomagic Realm was weakening.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Phantomagic Realm used to look like a real world. Even Osborne's Satan's Eye couldn't detect that it was actually an illusionary space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even at that time, everything inside the Phantomagic Realm seemed to be tangible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, his Satan's Eye could easily spot its flaws because the illusionary space of the Phantomagic Realm had become less realistic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was a sign of the Phantomagic Realm's weakening power, clearly caused by the ninety-nine Bewitching Lanterns frantically absorbing its energy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Others couldn't notice such changes yet; even Osborne could only detect this flaw using his Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, if this continues, the Phantomagic Realm will soon collapse. Once all its power is absorbed by those Bewitching Lanterns, it will no longer be able to maintain its original form.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne estimated that in at most three days, the Phantomagic Realm would be on the verge of collapse, and that demonic cultivator would surely act before it happened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "I have at most three days left. Right now, there are still thirty-four Bewitching Lanterns I haven't found. But I've already searched all the edge locations of the Phantomagic Realm."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seems the remaining thirty-four Bewitching Lanterns must have been placed in the central area. Although placing the Bewitching Lanterns in the center of the Phantomagic Realm makes them easier to spot, it allows them to absorb the realm's power more conveniently and quickly. That's why the Phantomagic Realm's power is fading so fast."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne decided to search for the Bewitching Lanterns in the central area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although he had already secured sixty-five Bewitching Lanterns, roughly two-thirds of them, Osborne was still not satisfied.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Having control of two-thirds of the Bewitching Lanterns was not enough to ensure he could seize control.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Osborne was only at Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King, while that demonic cultivator was at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The gap in cultivation level and strength between them was too vast. Even if Osborne had an advantage, he might not be able to outmatch that demonic cultivator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he failed, everyone would be in big trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If that demonic cultivator gained control of the Bewitching Lanterns transforming into an Imperial Artifact, everyone in the Phantomagic Realm would die, including Osborne, Primordial, and Flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, they might not be able to be resurrected. So, Osborne was still very tense at this moment, hurrying to find the remaining Bewitching Lanterns.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said in surprise, "I found another Bewitching Lantern."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In a more central location of the Phantomagic Realm, Osborne quickly found a Bewitching Lantern, confirming that many Bewitching Lanterns had indeed been placed in the central area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The protective shields around these Bewitching Lanterns were indeed extraordinary. Many people had been around, but no one discovered this Bewitching Lantern.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I must keep going." Osborne dared not linger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the power of the Phantomagic Realm was absorbed by those Bewitching Lanterns and grew weaker, Osborne felt immense pressure, as if an incredibly sharp sword was hanging over his head, ready to fall at any moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The seventieth Bewitching Lantern!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The eightieth Bewitching Lantern!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The ninetieth Bewitching Lantern!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, three days passed. Osborne found more than twenty Bewitching Lanterns in the central area of the Phantomagic Realm. At this moment, the number of Bewitching Lanterns under his control reached ninety.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't find the remaining nine Bewitching Lanterns no matter what.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had almost searched through the entire Phantomagic Realm but only found ninety Bewitching Lanterns.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "Ninety Bewitching Lanterns should be enough."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he wasn't sure. He still wanted to find the last nine Bewitching Lanterns, but he couldn't.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, the Phantomagic Realm underwent a drastic change.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The most noticeable change was that the Phantomagic Realm was rapidly shrinking in size.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The once vast edges of the Phantomagic Realm were disappearing. Everyone was forced to move toward the central area of the Phantomagic Realm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the crowd moved closer, more intense fights broke out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most people were still engrossed in fighting over the Dragon Elixir. People were dying every moment. They had no idea a man-made disaster was approaching them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, another day passed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne avoided the chaotic crowd and continued searching for the Bewitching Lantern. However, he could never find the last nine Bewitching Lanterns, as if they had vanished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By this time, the Phantomagic Realm's area was only one-tenth of its original size.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Osborne's Satan's Eye, the Phantomagic Realm could collapse or vanish at any moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, others also noticed the anomaly and whispered among themselves.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A man said in confusion, "What's going on? The Phantomagic Realm seems off. It looks like it's about to collapse."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A woman responded, "That's impossible. How could the Phantomagic Realm collapse? Even if time's up, it would just vanish into the dimensional rift. After a long time, it would reappear somewhere else."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man insisted, "But I clearly saw the Phantomagic Realm collapsing."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another woman agreed, "I felt it too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, almost everyone sensed something was wrong. They finally stopped fighting and started investigating the situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not far away, a group of people hid in the shadows, including Dalia, Romina, and others from Blossom Cage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dalia's eyes were filled with excitement. She murmured, "The Bewitching Lanterns have almost absorbed the power of the Phantomagic Realm. It will collapse in a while. By then, these people will flee. So, let's act now."</span></p><div class="pagination">
