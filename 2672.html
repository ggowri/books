  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They actually went in just like that!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow, thinking, "It seems they've disregarded the danger for the sake of power! However, this isn't exactly good news for me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If there&rsquo;s no danger in the forest, they&rsquo;ll obtain a large number of emperor fruits, rapidly boosting their strength to easily become Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean, and might even break through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But if there&rsquo;s real danger inside and they die in there, I won&rsquo;t be able to take revenge with my own hands, nor will I get to torture and humiliate them..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was a bit hesitant at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He also wanted to enter the forest. Moreover, after the three of them entered, there didn&rsquo;t seem to be any unusual occurrences.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, don't rush. Observe the situation a bit more before deciding!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial stopped Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, someone else appeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, six or seven Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors appeared, rushing in from all directions. After exchanging glances, they all looked at the forest in astonishment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Obviously, they were also drawn by the powerful spiritual energy emanating from the forest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the astral projections in the Ancient Battlefield had all vanished, leaving no more danger. He was rushing over quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sure enough, more and more people kept arriving.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, over thirty people had gathered outside the forest, all of them Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors, including May!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior who arrived first and hid earlier now stepped out from the ruins.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's going on here?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I haven't seen even a blade of grass in this dangerous Ancient Battlefield, yet there's a lush forest in the central area?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There's such powerful spiritual energy in the forest? Just taking a breath feels like I'm about to break through my cultivation level!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What exactly is going on?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why isn't anyone going in?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the crowd gathered together, discussing rapidly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne frowned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "The people rushing here are all warriors of Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, which makes sense. Their cultivation level is high, allowing them to sense the spiritual energy emanating from the forest more clearly, and they are also the fastest."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But why aren't Frederick and Adriana here?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With their strength, they should have been the first to arrive...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Could it be that they are already dead?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't believe his own guess!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt that with Frederick and Adriana's strength, even without gaining much from the Skyfall Casket, surviving shouldn't be an issue.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick knows the Skyfall Casket best and must have made all kinds of preparations. Unless his luck was terrible, it's unlikely something went wrong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana isn't weak either. She's already mastered using the Inferior Imperial Artifact Panoply Armor and holds the Inferior Imperial Artifact Boxing Gloves. Even if she encounters the astral projection of an Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, she could still put up a fight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't believe Adriana was dead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he didn't understand why they weren't here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Could they be hiding nearby?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne scanned the surroundings with Satan's Eye but found no one hiding, only noticing many people rushing over quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne murmured, "Callista isn't here either! Could she be dead?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought it was possible. Callista was just a Common Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, and in this dangerous Ancient Battlefield, her death would be quite normal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the more than thirty Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors were discussing even more intensely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why not enter this forest? I think everyone knows! This forest is too strange. I sense danger. I'm a bit worried."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, before you arrived, someone had already gone in! The Royal Family's Weston, Quinn, and Naomi, all three of them have entered!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's been so long, and this forest still hasn't reacted. Maybe there's no danger! Meanwhile, those three are quickly scavenging emperor fruits and other treasures inside!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We can't hesitate any longer!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We must go in immediately! Even if there's danger, together we can hold off Supreme True Imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors for a while!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After this person finished speaking, everyone wanted to go in.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's right! We can all clearly feel the dense spiritual energy of this forest! Those treasures are right in front of us, should we leave just because of fear and danger?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone, with your talents, it's impossible to break through the cultivation level under normal circumstances! You will only age, die slowly, and become dust in the universe!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, we should give it a try!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If we obtain the treasures inside and break through the cultivation level to become Imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors, we can gain prolonged lifespans again. We might even venture deeper into the universe, pursue higher cultivation levels, and witness the true wonders of this cosmos."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, whether you go in or not, I will definitely go in!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying this, the person rushed straight into the forest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With this person taking the lead, the others no longer hesitated and rushed into the forest one after another.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the outside of the forest fell silent again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But shortly after, more people appeared&mdash;it was the Royal Family's guards.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, all these people were Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, but now, a few of them had become Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They didn't hesitate much and rushed straight into the forest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon after, more people appeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was Brenda, Mason, Clara, Leroy, and Casey.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was overjoyed to see them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They're still alive!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seems they were quite lucky&mdash;not only did they survive until now, but their cultivation level has improved significantly. Casey has already reached advanced Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Leroy and Clara's cultivation levels have both reached Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This left Osborne stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How did they gain more than I did? I only advanced from advanced Empyrean Sacredness to Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, but they went from primary Empyrean Sacredness to Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection?" Osborne exclaimed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, his luck in the Skyfall Casket wasn&rsquo;t great. His gains weren&rsquo;t much different from others, and some even surpassed his.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, this doesn&rsquo;t include the hundreds of emperor fruits Osborne obtained.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, his gains would still be immense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Mason, Brenda, and the others were all gazing at the jungle, their eyes filled with excitement, exhilaration, and greed. Their gains were decent too, with most of the survivors having already reached advanced Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This saved them hundreds of years of cultivation time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, they didn&rsquo;t hesitate long before rushing into the jungle. Even Clara, Leroy, and Casey, at the back of the group, couldn&rsquo;t wait to charge in.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Osborne immediately became a bit anxious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew he couldn&rsquo;t wait any longer!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, most of the people who entered the Skyfall Casket had already ventured into the jungle. Except for Frederick and Adriana, the others who hadn&rsquo;t shown up were most likely already dead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing them about to enter the dangerous jungle, Osborne immediately rushed out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne blocked Clara, Leroy, and Casey in front of him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wait!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
