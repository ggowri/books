  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After tucking away the token from the sixth layer, Osborne took a peek at the info on his badge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His score was still lingering at 300 thousand points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His standing on the leaderboard had taken a nosedive. An hour ago, he was sitting pretty in first place, but now he'd slipped down to third.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horace was currently leading the score rankings, having amassed a staggering 500 thousand points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right behind him was Agatha, with 400 thousand points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, with his 300 thousand points, found himself in third place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson was in fourth, having earned 200 thousand points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Further down the list, Conrad was in sixth position with 130 thousand points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave occupied the nineteenth spot, having scored 654 hundred points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mumbled to himself, "Third place, eh?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This Horace guy is a real hotshot. He managed to snag five tokens on the sixth layer in no time flat! And Agatha's not far behind, with four tokens to her name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And that's just the ones they've registered! Maybe they're playing the same game as me, finding tokens but holding off on registering them, keeping a low-key profile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then again, that's probably wishful thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, they're already in the top four on the strength rankings. They're the center of everyone's attention anyway. There's no point in them following my lead and flying under the radar. So, chances are they're registering those tokens as soon as they lay their hands on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even so, they're still pretty darn impressive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Without my Satan's Eye, I'd be up shit creek trying to find these tokens. The conditions on the sixth layer are just a total bitch. You </span><span>gotta</span><span> fend off the effects of that harsh environment while scouring a crazy-complex terrain for those well-hidden tokens. It's a real uphill battle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even with my Satan's Eye, I've only managed to bag ten tokens! And they've found five and four respectively. Do they have some kind of super-vision enhancement? Or maybe they've got some ability to boost their senses so they can sniff out those tokens from a mile away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd already discovered ten tokens. If he registered them all, his score would skyrocket to one million. Based on past experience in the state duel, one million points was more than enough to secure a spot in the top ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Osborne wasn't in such a mad dash to find more tokens anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason he'd only registered three tokens and stashed the other seven away was to keep a low profile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, if he was sitting at the top of the leaderboard with twice the score of the second-place contestant, he'd definitely become the hot topic of the whole shebang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Horace and Agatha, who were also out there hunting for tokens on the sixth layer, might start eyeing him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Alright! Enough of overthinking. It's time to get back in the game and hunt for those tokens!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I </span><span>gotta</span><span> find as many tokens as I can in these three days and rack up as many points as possible. After all, I don't just want to make it into the top ten myself. I'm even aiming for the championship. And I also want to drag Clara into the top-ten club!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, Osborne resumed his search.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Satan's Eye swept across the intricate environment, seeing every little nook and cranny as clear as day. Before long, he spotted another token tucked away in a hidden corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eleventh one, bingo!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then came the twelfth, the thirteenth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne just kept on finding more and more tokens, but he didn't bother registering them. So, his score stayed put at 300 thousand. As more and more people zoomed past him on the leaderboard, his ranking gradually slipped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had absolutely no clue that because he'd been on the sixth layer for ages and his score hadn't budged in a long time, a whole bunch of people were convinced he was a goner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This guy, who'd briefly sat at the top of the leaderboard, became the talk of the town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even those out there searching for tokens inside the Arctic Maw Chasm were chattering away about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, on the third layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After scouring the fourth layer for over three hours, Clara finally made up her mind to call it quits. Even though she still had a decent amount of Sacred Power in the tank, she decided to head back to the third layer early for a breather, just to play it safe. Her plan was to make a comeback to the fourth layer once her Sacred Power was fully recharged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint smile appeared on Clara's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I've really hit the jackpot! I managed to snag a total of twenty-eight tokens! Each token on the fourth layer is worth a cool thousand points, so that's twenty-eight thousand right there!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I wonder how Osborne's holding up.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in her head, Clara pulled out her badge to check the leaderboard. She'd been so wrapped up in the token-hunting frenzy that this was the very first time she'd bothered to peek at the rankings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The big shot at the top of the leaderboard now was Agatha, sitting pretty with a whopping score of 800 thousand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right behind her in second place was Horace, with 700 thousand points to his name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Occupying the third and fourth spots were Benson and Broderick, each racking up 400 thousand points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon laying eyes on the top four, Clara was left a bit </span><span>gobsmacked</span><span>. Sure, she'd had a stroke of luck on the fourth layer, but the tokens she'd found only amounted to less than thirty thousand points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And those top four guys? Their scores were a good ten times more than hers!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, the rankings did jibe with the strength rankings. The bigwigs at the top of the leaderboard were also the cream of the crop in terms of strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when Clara caught sight of the fifth-place finisher on the leaderboard, she felt as if she'd been hit by a bolt of lightning. Clara even rubbed her eyes hard, making double-sure she wasn't hallucinating, before a look of sheer shock spread across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fifth place was Osborne, with a staggering 300 thousand points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Holy smokes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara let out a gasp, and a wave of elation washed over her.</span><br><span>Has Osborne really managed to score 300 thousand points? That was more than ten times what I'd gotten! And he is sitting pretty in fifth place on the leaderboard?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was beyond belief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the blink of an eye, Clara's face fell, and a worried look took over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara was no fool. One glance at Osborne's score and she instantly cottoned on to the only possible way he could've raked in so many points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had ventured into the sixth layer!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Clara had never set foot in the sixth layer herself, she'd heard plenty of chatter about it. She knew just how hair-raising it was. Only the top twenty powerhouses in the strength rankings could hang around on the sixth layer for any length of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, they could end up biting the dust in there and never make it out alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara tried to pep herself up, murmuring, "Osborne, what on earth made him head for the sixth layer? But he'll be okay! I mean, how else could he have scored so many points?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a bunch of folks came back to the third layer via the Translocator. It was obvious they were a tight-knit group, and they were yapping away about something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That Osborne hasn't increased his score in over three hours since he topped the leaderboard! He must have died on the sixth layer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha! What an idiot! He's ranked outside the top one hundred in terms of strength, yet he dared to go to the sixth layer! He was lucky enough to get 300 thousand points in ten minutes, but he paid for it with his life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He must be dead! Otherwise, his score wouldn't be stuck. What a pity about those 300 thousand points. If we had them, we could easily get into the top twenty, maybe even the top ten!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, what a waste! 300 thousand points..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The conversation drifted into Clara's ears, and in an instant, her face lost all its color, turning as pale as a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Osborne? Dead on the sixth layer?</span></p><div class="pagination">
