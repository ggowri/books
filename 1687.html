  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne's declaration hung heavily in the air, the expressions on everyone's faces shifted from confusion to sheer panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, Edison looked particularly </span><span>sullen</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Athena was his niece</span><span>. </span><span>Osborne kill</span><span>ed</span><span> her right before his eyes</span><span>. But he didn't dare say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone turned their gaze to Angelo, and </span><span>they left the last hope</span><span> on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo was a Deity King. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all silently </span><span>expected </span><span>Angelo</span><span> to turn the tables</span><span>. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all Deity Overlords, accustomed to standing atop the hierarchy. Surrendering to someone from the Human Community? Unthinkable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their minds, Human Community was a lowly </span><span>group</span><span>, fit only to be trampled underfoot, mere slaves </span><span>or dust. They were </span><span>meant to be humiliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Osborne demonstrating power on par with a Deity King, they were unwilling to bow </span><span>to this humble human.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But stubbornness never stopped the tide of reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clenched his fists, eyeing Osborne and the eight clones, weighing his options. "If a fight breaks out, can I even escape?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He </span><span>wouldn't help</span><span> Edison and the others. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because his </span><span>own survival was </span><span>pretty hard now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo abruptly realized that Osborne had skillfully surrounded them, cutting off any possible escape routes. Panic washed over him as he understood the impossibility of breaking free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your name is Osborne Augustine, right? I must admit, you're quite impressive. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>You've deceived me completely! But do you think we'll surrender? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Dream on! We'd rather die than bow to the pathetic Human Community!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words were filled with defiance as divine power surged within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, "If that's the case, then there's nothing more to discuss! I didn't plan </span><span>to let you off</span><span>. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>You're a Deity King</span><span>. If I don't ruin you first, I can't make you a proper </span><span>Blood Clan member.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne</span><span> gave an order, "Time to get to work!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the eight clones sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Stay </span><span>away from me!" Angelo shouted as he released a powerful wave of mind control energy, forcing his way in a single direction at breakneck speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Running from a spatial metahuman? Really? I must say, you're </span><span>so </span><span>foolish. It's been a while since you've dealt with one, </span><span>huh</span><span>? </span><span>You even forgot</span><span> the basic</span><span> combat common sense</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His disdain was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next heartbeat, all eight of Osborne's clones vanished from sight, only to reappear around Angelo once more, effectively cornering him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo's expression darkened even further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't fought a spatial metahuman in ages, and realizing there was no escape was a crushing blow. He unleashed everything he had, raw mind control battering Osborne's clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's clones boasted attack power equal to his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only when Osborne wielded the Abyssal Spear could he surpass them, making each clone's strength a formidable force in its own right, equivalent to that of a Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, spatial clones had their weaknesses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For one, their defense lacked the strength of Osborne's true form. They hadn't yet reached Deity King levels in that regard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Angelo's relentless assault, it was clear that Osborne's clones wouldn't last long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, their speed was remarkable. Harnessing the power of space, they dodged most of Angelo's attacks, making it hard for him to land a hit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, they shared a mental connection, allowing them to coordinate seamlessly. While a single clone might struggle against Angelo's might, together, they formed a nearly impenetrable defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Angelo's full-throttle efforts, he found himself unable to overcome the combined strength of Osborne's eight clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They pressed him down with ease, and it was only a matter of time before they would defeat him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne faced Edison and the forty or so others with a smirk plastered across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, what's </span><span>your decision</span><span>? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Will you surrender and bow to me, or do I have to beat you into submission first?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edison and the others exchanged nervous glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them was at least a mid-stage Deity Overlord, having survived the earlier onslaught of the Deathborn Army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weaker ones had already fallen, leaving only the strongest leaders, many of whom held positions like leaders of ten thousand or even ranks of brigadier general and general.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had no intention of killing them outright, His goal was to transform them into members of the Blood Clan. With them under his control, he could manipulate the Wild Flame Army from the shadows, potentially converting the entire force into his own Blood Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Edison wasn't about to let that happen without a fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clenching his jaw, </span><span>Edison</span><span> suddenly shouted, "Everyone, scatter</span><span> to escape</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's just one guy. If we split up, some of us might </span><span>escape successfully! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>We need to get word back about what's happening here</span><span>! T</span><span>hen Osborne </span><span>will be doomed! Go!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Edison shoved one of his comrades toward Osborne, hoping to buy himself some time. He then darted off in the opposite direction, determined to escape</span><span> from </span><span>Osborne</span><span>'s control.</span></p><div class="pagination">
