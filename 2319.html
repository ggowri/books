  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara furrowed her brows, her face a picture of disbelief. "What? You're gonna get all of us into the top ten? No way!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, this is the last day of the state duel. If we're super lucky, we might help you squeeze into the top ten. But for us? You really don't need to worry. There's no way we can make it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy chimed in, nodding in agreement, "Exactly! If the duel had just begun, with your skills and a bit of good fortune, we might've had a shot. But now? Time's ticking. Helping you get in would be plenty for us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry about other things. We're not really hung up on getting into the top ten."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne flashed a calm smile. "Who says you can't make it? If I say you can, then you will! We're a team, after all. I'm not going to the top ten alone. I'm taking all of you with me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, what's the point of being a team? I never promised you anything or gave you any Sacred Crystals."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..." Clara started to say, but Osborne cut her off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No buts! I've got a plan to get you all in the top ten. Once we handle the points, you'll see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Points distribution?" The two exchanged a surprised look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd heard Osborne mention it again, and they were puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How else could we distribute points?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">We can only give him a tenth of their scores at most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, Osborne pulled out a token from his pocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a gorgeous blue, glittering like a star.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that... the token from the sixth layer?!" Leroy gasped, her eyes wide in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was also capable of reaching the sixth layer, but she'd only gone there to find Osborne and never came across the token.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Leroy recognized it right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The token in Osborne's hand was definitely from the sixth layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tokens from the sixth layer were incredibly valuable. Each one was worth a whopping one hundred thousand points. It was mind-boggling to realize he had an unregistered sixth-layer token on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Leroy and Clara were left gobsmacked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But their shock hit a whole new level when Osborne quickly pulled out more sixth-layer tokens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were so many that it felt like a wild dream, making their heads spin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, a whopping one hundred and sixty-five sixth-layer tokens were laid out in front of them, leaving them completely dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their breathing got rapid, and their faces flushed with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where on earth did all these sixth-layer tokens come from? If we registered them, how many points would that be?" Clara murmured, barely able to catch her breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a gentle smile. "There are one hundred and sixty-five tokens in total, all from the sixth layer! I found them there but held off on registering. I wanted to wait until I found you guys to figure out how to split them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One hundred and sixty-five sixth-layer tokens add up to 16.5 million points!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he finished, Clara and Leroy's eyes popped open even wider, shock written all over their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was an insane amount!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The current top scorer on the leaderboard, Agatha, only had a bit over eight million points. If Osborne registered all those tokens under his name, he'd shoot straight to the top&mdash;by a huge margin!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His score would be twice that of Agatha's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But here was Osborne saying he wanted to share these tokens with them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy and Clara exchanged a look. Both of them couldn't help swallowing hard in disbelief. Their throats went dry with a mix of excitement and anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, how the hell did you find so many sixth-layer tokens? And why can't I detect them with my badge? They've gotta be fake, right?" Clara asked, her face full of doubt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a soft chuckle, clearly finding the situation funny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chill out, they're all the real deal! I just got lucky. I found these in the sixth layer, and there's no question about it. The reason you can't sense them is that I've got a special way to hide their presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't trust me, just stick these tokens on your badges and see if your points shoot up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, Osborne split the one hundred and sixty-five tokens into three piles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clara, this one's for you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leroy, here's yours!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once you register these tokens, as long as there are no unexpected problems and no one tries to steal them from you, you'll definitely make it into the top ten!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne motioned to the remaining tokens, continuing, "And this? This is my share! That way, the three of us can represent Zephyr State in the zone duel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne finished speaking, the two girls just stood there, completely stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stared at the pile of tokens in front of them, their minds going blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This... this is just too much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had just given each of them fifty tokens, which meant a whopping five million points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adding that to their previous 800 thousand points, they'd have 5.8 million points. That would land them firmly in the fifth place on the leaderboard, right behind Agatha, Horace, Broderick, and Benson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd be nearly two million points ahead of the seventh-ranked person!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as not too many people tried to steal their points, they were pretty much a shoo-in for the top ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, their breathing quickened, and the air was charged with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled casually, "Too much? I think it's just perfect! The higher our ranking, the more Kingdom Duel Scorepoints we'll get! It's a pity I didn't find more tokens. If I had, the three of us would be at the top of the leaderboard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he started registering the tokens, carefully sticking each one onto his badge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, his points started to skyrocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, Osborne had 300 thousand points. After taking down Jared, he'd gotten Jared's 320 thousand points. So in total, he had 620 thousand points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, his score was shooting up like a rocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It climbed by a massive hundred thousand points every second!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The digital scoreboard, with its bright and flickering lights, became the center of all attention. As the numbers changed, a hush fell over the onlookers in Frost Peak City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Osborne's score and ranking shoot up like a bullet, Leroy and Clara were absolutely gobsmacked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those sixth-layer tokens were the real deal after all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Clara whipped around to Leroy, her eyes as wide as saucers. "We gotta register these tokens, and fast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah! Otherwise, some vultures might come around, trying to steal them. We're not scared, but it'd be a huge pain in the neck. Let's log them in first!" Osborne urged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them exchanged a determined look, and Clara and Leroy both nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara said sincerely, "Thanks, Osborne! We never thought we'd have a shot at the top ten. We can't pass up an opportunity like this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy added, "Let's cut the small talk. We're a team! We owe you big. If you ever need anything, just say the word. No ifs, ands, or buts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, let's go secure our spots in the top ten and gear up for the zone duel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fired up and ready to go, the two of them eagerly started registering their tokens, excited about what lay ahead.</span></p><div class="pagination">
