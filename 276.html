  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From her eyes, two beams of radiant light unexpectedly shot forth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The light petrified space itself as it passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was drained of color, and all thoughts of Venom Lord had been forgotten. He tore open a dimensional rift swiftly in front of Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rift opened like a monstrous maw, attempting to devour the two beams of light into another dimension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne's attempt was in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon contact with the rift, the beams didn't vanish; instead, it was instantly turned to stone and then crumbled with a thunderous roar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beams merely dimmed slightly, still advancing towards Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Osborne turned alarmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, watch out! Dodge it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how could Clarissa dodge such an attack?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, she stood unafraid, staring down the terrifying beams, and cried out, "Divine and Demonic Wings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the void shook violently. A burst of intense, dual-toned light erupted behind Clarissa&mdash;sacred white and infernal black&mdash;forming a pair of extraordinary wings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One half resembled angelic wings, the other demonic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The colossal wings flapped, instantly enveloping Clarissa and shielding her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the dreadful beams finally struck, they hit the Divine and Demonic Wings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bizarre sound echoed. The wings began to calcify as if attempting to turn both the wings and Clarissa to stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before the petrification could finish, the stones seemed to melt, vanishing swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simultaneously, an inexplicable force rebounded from the wings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa's body became encased in stone quickly, only to dissolve away just as fast, her face now a mask of shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible? Damn it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Intelligence failure! The </span><span>Fatebearer</span><span> has grown stronger. She's at least a Class B+ metahuman. If we kill her, the backlash could turn me to ash in an instant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Retreat! Abort the mission!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The </span><span>Fatebearer</span><span> cannot be killed, not by our organization's hand! It could bring ruin upon us all! Retreat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa's face was filled with panic, her eyes reflecting fear for the first time as she looked at Clarissa, enveloped by her wings. She made to flee without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Going somewhere? Not a chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Clarissa was safe, Osborne breathed a sigh of relief. Spotting Medusa's retreat, he gritted his teeth and shot out a bolt of blue Devil's Light to bar her escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with a mere glance, Medusa turned the blue light to stone, which then shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is my fifth-level Devil's Light not even a momentary obstacle for her? She's undoubtedly a Class A master!" Osborne's thoughts were a whirlwind of alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew in that instant that he couldn't stop Medusa with his current strength. Swiftly, he redirected his focus to Venom Lord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's a Class A master, but you're not! You dared to assassinate Clarissa. Now, you'll pay the price. You're staying here permanently!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, the Devil's Light blasted toward Venom Lord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Medusa flee, Venom Lord panicked, but surrounded by countless rifts, he was vulnerable and unable to muster speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's assault left him in disarray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, he was overpowered by Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was merely a Class B+ metahuman. His power to control </span><span>Necrovenom</span><span> made him a formidable foe, but it was useless against Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's means, however, left him struggling. Barring a miracle, he'd soon be killed by Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Medusa, help me!" Venom Lord shouted desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa, nearly out of the castle, turned at his cry, her face a mask of fury as she cursed, "What a waste!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her anger, she turned, shooting two beams from her eyes that set off Osborne's Satan's Eye in a violent alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sensed an overwhelming threat. He wasn't Clarissa; he didn't have the Divine and Demonic Wings to shield him from the beams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Osborne dove into a dimensional rift, narrowly escaping Medusa's assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This gave Venom Lord the opportunity he needed to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Medusa continued to fire beams from her eyes, more rifts petrified and collapsed, and Venom Lord finally seized his chance to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go! The </span><span>Fatebearer</span><span> has grown. We must relay this news!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa grabbed Venom Lord's arm, ready to make a swift exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could only watch helplessly as they vanished from the castle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My power is still insufficient! If I were a Class A master, I would have detained them no matter what today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne clenched his fists, yearning for more strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Medusa and Venom Lord were about to leave the castle and disappear for good, a terrifying surge of energy arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An elderly voice echoed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you've come, you might as well stay! A fledgling master daring to act out in my domain?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Subjugate!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
