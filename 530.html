  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, I have a feeling we're being watched closely," Nathan said, jogging up to him as they entered the Ninth Estate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne gave a faint smile. "Don't worry about them for now. Let's get settled first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Ninth Estate boasted a collection of over a dozen lavish mansions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne chose the most central one, moving in with Zoe and Anastasia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yulissa and Kendra also decided to stay, and with so many rooms, fitting all five of them in was a breeze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Augustine family members tactfully avoided probing into Anastasia and Zoe's backgrounds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once everyone was settled, a large crowd arrived outside the Ninth Estate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, it looks like the heirs from the Seventh Estate and the Eighth Estate have come to visit. They specifically asked to see you, and they seem pretty intense. Something tells me they're not here just for a friendly chat," Nathan said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne raised an eyebrow. "Intense? That's odd. We've only just arrived and haven't had a chance to offend anyone. Why would they target us?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He pondered the situation but couldn't figure out the reason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's go find out what they want," Osborne said, heading outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In front of the estate, a massive reception hall was filled with more than twenty imposing figures. Each of them wore a stern expression and exuded a palpable pressure that made Queenie and her team sweat nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Osborne arrived, Queenie visibly relaxed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Everyone, this is Osborne, the heir of the Augustine family here in Dampston, and also the head of our branch. If you have any business, you can discuss it with him," Queenie introduced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, the group of somber faces turned their attention to Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Remaining calm, Osborne stepped into the hall and took stock of the twenty or so individuals.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though they stood together, they seemed to form two distinct groups, hinting at their affiliation with different Augustine family branches.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">None looked older than forty, and their collective presence was formidable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie moved quickly to Osborne's side, whispering, "Osborne, they say they're here for a visit, but it seems like they have a bone to pick. They're from the Augustine family branches of Narciso and Clifford."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite sensing potential trouble, he kept his tone polite. "Welcome, everyone. I'm Osborne, the heir of the Augustine family branch bloodline in Dampston. I'm new around here, so I hope we can all get along.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And how should I address you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The group exchanged glances but didn't immediately confront him. Instead, two individuals stepped forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One of them sneered, saying, "So you're Osborne? I'm Henry Augustine, heir of the Narciso branch bloodline. I live in the Seventh Estate. You'd better remember my name."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Henry was strikingly handsome, around thirty-four or thirty-five, with shoulder-length hair that gave him an artistic air. However, his cold gaze made him seem unapproachable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiled and nodded, saying, "Nice to meet you, Henry. I'll remember your name."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Henry snorted in response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The second person spoke up, "I'm John Augustine, heir of the Clifford branch bloodline. I live in the Eighth Estate. You should remember my name too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">John, also in his mid-thirties, had an unremarkable appearance, easily lost in a crowd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne offered a friendly smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hello, John."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After that, Osborne's expression turned cold. He said with a detached tone, "You two have come here with hostility. What exactly do you want?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Henry sneered, his voice icy, saying, "Oh, nothing much. We just heard you're quite the hotshot. I mean, you even dared to cross Evelynn, the main bloodline member?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You've got some nerve!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We're here to challenge you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do the smart thing and come with us to Challenge Peak!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Today, we're going to get revenge for Evelynn."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Henry's face was a mask of disdain and challenge as he glared at Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne raised an eyebrow, finally understanding why these two were so antagonistic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "Ah, I see now they're here to get back at me on Evelynn's behalf."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne gave a faint, bemused smile and replied, "There's really no need for this. Sure, Evelynn might be a main bloodline member, but you're both from prominent branch families yourselves. You don't have to go this far just to defend her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is she the one who sent you to confront me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Henry snorted dismissively, saying, "That's none of your business! The point is, we're not happy with you. We both still have our challenge rights, and we're here to use them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By challenging you, we've made it so you can't refuse. If you try to back out, we're fully within our rights to deal with you here and now without facing any consequences!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you're smart, you'll come with us to Challenge Peak right away. That way, you'll at least have a fair shot at fighting us!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Henry's contempt was palpable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">John chimed in with a cold stare, saying, "Evelynn's only twenty-three this year, and she's just been using Satan's Eye for three years. What's so impressive about picking on her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Show us what you've got. We'll make sure you realize that in the Augustine family, your little bit of skill means nothing. You'd better learn to keep a lower profile from now on!"</p><div class="pagination">
