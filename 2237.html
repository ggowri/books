  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela asked in a hurry, "Osborne, Isa, why won't you take the test?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just a quick check! If you don't want to be our disciples, we won't twist your arms! Or do you think we're not up to snuff? We can help you find someone even more powerful to mentor you, someone who can really show you the ropes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you've got the talent, we could even put in a good word for you with the leader of the Fairy Moon Sect! The leader is the big-shot warrior on the whole Racial Convergence Planet. Tons of Empyrean Sacredness warriors have tried to get in her good graces, but she's given them all the cold shoulder!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but let out a little snort at that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew exactly how powerful the leader of the Fairy Moon Sect was because, in his past life, he'd caught a glimpse of her when she visited the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a woman with oodles of charm and power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even his dad had treated her with kid gloves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumor had it that his dad had once tried to woo her, hoping to tie the knot, only to get shot down brutally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a nutshell, she was a super-warrior whose ranking was among the top few on the Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Training under someone like her would definitely save Osborne from making a bunch of wrong turns and let him shoot up the ranks to become one of the top warriors on the planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne remained dead-set on his decision&mdash;he wasn't going to take on a mentor!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The path he was about to embark on was way too risky and foolhardy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne became the disciple of the Fairy Moon Sect's leader, she'd surely try to put the kibosh on his plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if she didn't, he'd end up pulling the Fairy Moon Sect into his mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had no desire to drag anyone else into it; he'd rather bear the burden all by himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, shaking his head, "Sorry, Angela. I've got my own issues, and I really don't feel like having a mentor!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, my talent is just so-so, nothing like theirs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Isa. "Isa, maybe you should&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa cut him off, shaking her head like crazy. "Osborne, don't even bother trying to talk me into it! If we both become disciples and leave, who's </span><span>gonna</span><span> look out for you? When you're in a jam, who's </span><span>gonna</span><span> have your back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her determination was plain as day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out an exasperated sigh. "I'm old enough to take care of myself! I appreciate you worrying about me, but we've got a long road ahead... And to be honest, having you around right now won't really do me any good; it'll just be a pain in the neck!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa bit her lip upon hearing his words, clearly conflicted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued, "Isa, you should go with them! The seniors of the Fairy Moon Sect will surely train you up nicely! If you truly want to help me, then strive to reach Empyrean Sacredness as quickly as possible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only when you reach Empyrean Sacredness can you really lend me a hand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's tone turned solemn. "So, please, just do as I say!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa wrestled with her feelings. She knew he made sense. Sticking by Osborne's side now would only relegate her to a servant, and she'd be of no real help to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the mere thought of leaving him alone and unprotected made Isa's heart ache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne persuaded, "Just listen to me! Go take the test! To be honest, I'm really curious about your talent. When I first met you, I could tell there was something extraordinary about you. That's why I passed on my power to you in my past life. You've never let me down...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You shouldn't be squandering your potential by staying with me as a mere servant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, give it a try!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Buoyed by Osborne's encouragement, Isa finally gave in. Biting her lip, she slowly nodded and made her way towards the Astral Testing Arch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela, Amber, and the others all heaved a collective sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Osborne had declined the test, Isa's willingness was more than sufficient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their view, one of the two had to be a Celestial Progeny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Isa passed the test, it would clear up all the mysteries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Isa scored Class SS, then Osborne would be the Celestial Progeny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the flip side, if she scored Class SSS, it would mean Osborne couldn't possibly be one, since the odds of two Celestial Progenies crossing paths were extremely slim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group watched Isa with a blend of nervousness and anticipation as she stepped into the arch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A brilliant light engulfed her, kicking off the scan. This time, though, the scanning process seemed to drag on longer than normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa frowned, sensing that something wasn't right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Amber, Angela, and the others were breathing heavily, their faces lined with tension and excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the Astral Testing Arch finished its examination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four of them instantly turned to check the results, and in the next moment, it was as if the air had been knocked out of them, their eyes wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Class SSS!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa had achieved a Class SSS score on the Astral Testing Arch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Celestial Progeny!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She really is a Celestial Progeny!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela, Amber, and the others were all flabbergasted. Although they had harbored suspicions before, having the test confirm Isa as a Class SSS Celestial Progeny was truly mind-boggling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, they swarmed around Isa, their faces alight with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amber snapped out her orders urgently. "Angela, keep this news under wraps!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gwen, get in touch with our teachers right away! No, go straight to the leader!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's a Celestial Progeny! None of us are qualified to be her mentors, not even the Elders. Only the leader of the sect has the privilege of taking her on as a disciple!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This will be the first Celestial Progeny in our Fairy Moon Sect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can't let anyone know about her existence until she's grown stronger! Not a soul can find out about her until she's ready!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quickly, get in touch with the leader!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amber's voice trembled with a mix of excitement and anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amber's voice quivered with a blend of exhilaration and unease. A potent aura burst forth from their bodies, spreading across the area like a shield, making sure no one could meddle in their business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, even Osborne was caught off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Class SSS? She's a Celestial Progeny?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And it's Isa! Really?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was </span><span>well aware</span><span> that Isa had extraordinary talent; otherwise, he wouldn't have picked her to inherit the powers from his past life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it never crossed his mind that she'd turn out to be a Class SSS Celestial Progeny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a genuine cosmic treasure!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A prodigy who could hold her own against the geniuses of the Sacred Dragon Clan and the Sacred Tiger Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was left speechless for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa, Anastasia, and the others were just as confused. They watched Angela and Amber's overjoyed reactions, sensing that something earth-shattering was happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Isa stood there, looking dazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cast a glance at Osborne, as if he were the only one who could calm her nerves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a moment to pull himself together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was genuinely thrilled for Isa. With a beaming smile, he said, "Isa, congratulations! I never thought your talent would reach Class SSS. You're truly a Celestial Progeny... Before long, your name will resound throughout the Racial Convergence Planet! You're going to become the personal disciple of the Fairy Moon Sect's leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just don't turn your back on us when you've made it big!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
