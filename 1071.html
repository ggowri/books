  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star's words left everyone momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Wesson quickly gathered his wits. Though he was reluctant to make such a call, the dire situation left them with no choice but to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The interference from the League of Divine Descent and the Eityreia Organization had completely dashed their hopes of victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Continuing to fight would only lead to one outcome: total annihilation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with the God of Star able to hold back their enemies, they had a precious window to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they hesitated any longer, they might not even get that chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson shouted, his voice cutting through the chaos, "Listen up, everyone! We've lost this battle. Everyone, retreat immediately!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run for it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Every last one of you, get out while you still can!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Wesson's words sank in, a collective shock rippled through the crowd. They turned to their family leaders and elders, seeking guidance. As they saw the somber nods of their leaders, hesitation evaporated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run! If we don't move now, we'll miss our chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the coalition forces scattered, each person racing in different directions, desperate to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew that with Gerardo back in Rosmandi, claiming his throne in the underground world, their only hope for survival lay in finding a safe haven far from the Aberrants. Otherwise, death awaited them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Move it, people!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than a hundred Ancient Families and several superpowers were now in a frantic scramble, each group heading off in its own direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson joined the exodus, quickly gathering all the members of the Augustine family as they made their way to Challenge Peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside Challenge Peak, thousands of Augustine family members&mdash;many of whom were still below Class A&mdash;had been ready to evacuate for some time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, as the moment of truth arrived, they couldn't shake the feeling of bitterness at their defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was no time for regret! If they didn't escape now, they might never get another chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help the elderly and the weak! Stay calm and follow me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson waved his hand, and the Augustine family members fell in line behind him, moving swiftly away from the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon members took up the rear, ensuring the group's safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Do you really think you can get away? Die right here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's voice dripped with rage as he saw the Augustine family breaking for the exit. He was on the verge of wiping them out, and he wouldn't let them slip through his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bellowed, directing his Class S clones to intercept, "Kill them all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the next moment, an unseen force slammed into the Class S clones, sending them stumbling backward. A faint barrier of light had blocked their path, while the Augustine family slipped through unharmed, making their escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's fury intensified at the sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star's weak voice echoed through the air. "Ahem! I told you, while I can't kill you, I can certainly keep you trapped for a while."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Gerardo spat, his anger boiling over. "You think you can keep us locked up? You're dreaming! It's just a Level Five Realm! I'll shatter your Light Realm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, attack with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Gerardo launched himself into the fray, rallying all the Class S clones and the remaining ordinary clones and Human Slaves to join him in a concerted effort to break through the God of Star's Level Five Light Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air trembled as their overwhelming assault erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to Gerardo's shock, their fierce onslaught seemed to have no effect on the God of Star's Realm. It didn't even ripple; there was not a hint of disturbance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo stood there, dumbfounded, disbelief etched across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gerardo, don't waste your energy! It's a Level Five Realm!" Armstrong interjected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo turned to Armstrong, confusion etched on his face. "What is the big deal about Level Five Realm?" He couldn't fathom why Armstrong seemed so concerned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With an attack force of over ten thousand, even the strongest of Realms should crumble under their assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why, after all this time fighting, nobody had even unleashed the power of a Realm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It baffled him. Gerardo had never encountered a Level Five Realm before; his own Spatial Domain was barely at the pinnacle of Level Three, and he hadn't even cracked Level Four yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was sure of one thing: Level Five Realm couldn't be that impressive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had easily shattered Osborne's Level Four Light Realm with just a flick of his wrist. Even if Level Five Realm was stronger, it shouldn't be a monumental leap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here he was, pouring everything he had into this onslaught, with hundreds of Class S clones and over 10 thousand regular clones at his back, and yet that Level Five Realm stood unshaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was downright unreasonable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furrowing his brow, Gerardo tried to process this anomaly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armstrong continued, "Gerardo, your understanding of Realms is too limited! Don't you see? Level Four Realm is already incredibly solid, as tough as iron. But even iron can be shattered if you hit it with enough force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But a Level Five Realm is different. It's a domain only deities can wield! The power of a Realm is intertwined with the very fabric of space and time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's there, right in front of you, but you can't touch it..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
