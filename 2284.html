  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me start by introducing myself. I'm Gustave Fanny. These four are the teammates I've recruited. This is Quintina..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave then introduced the four people standing behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly realized that these four were no slouches. They were all ranked within the top 200 on the strength rankings. And those in the top 200 were nothing to scoff at. After all, Osborne himself was only ranked 108th, and Clara was barely hanging on to the top 300.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the eyes of the Zephyr State officials, Gustave, Quintina, and the rest were all stronger than Clara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave, in particular, was even more powerful than Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could tell that Gustave's introduction of his teammates was a subtle flex, a way to show off the team's strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, Gustave continued, "I'm well aware that on my own, there's no way I can break into the top ten in the state duel. That's why I'm pulling out all the stops to recruit more powerful warriors to join our team!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't rope in those ranked in the top hundred, so I've set my sights on assembling a team of at least ten warriors ranked within the top two hundred. That way, I still stand a fair chance of making it into the top ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I'm wondering, are you game?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne flashed a smile and then gave his head a shake. "Sorry, but I'll have to pass. I've already made plans to team up with someone else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave couldn't hide his disappointment. "All right then! I won't trouble you any further."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Gustave and his entourage took their leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't long before there was another knock on Osborne's courtyard door. Once again, it was someone looking to recruit Osborne for their team. This time, the offer was pretty much the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how things turned out, he'd get 50 thousand Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the recruiter made it into the top ten, the reward would jump to 100 thousand Sacred Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne turned down the offer once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then came the third group of recruiters, followed by the fourth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had rebuffed four waves of people trying to rope him into their teams, and he was starting to get fed up. But the onslaught didn't stop there. The fifth wave showed up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, it was someone he knew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Leroy in surprise. "What, are you here to ask me to join your team too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy grinned. "Looks like a bunch of folks have already come calling, but you've shot them all down. Well, I'm not here to recruit you. I've already got my team sorted... Besides, I'm just playing a supporting role, helping others go for the top ten. Why would I ask you to join?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a sigh of relief. "Then what brings you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy said, "I'm here to express my gratitude!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"During the city duel, I was hit by the backlash of the Sacred Artifact Inferno Drake Lance and went into a frenzy. All I could think about at that moment was beating you, even killing you! If you hadn't knocked me out in the nick of time, I would have suffered severe internal injuries that could have hampered my future potential. So, thanks for stepping in and helping me back then!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile. "I knocked you out and snatched the championship from you. And yet you're thanking me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy's face turned serious. "Let's keep things separate! You earned that championship fair and square with your own skills! Back then, you didn't have to take the quick route to defeat me. If you'd just stalled for a bit, I'd have been finished. But you still put yourself at risk to knock me out. You basically saved my skin!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I really have to thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Got it. I appreciate your gratitude. If there's nothing else, I'll get back to my cultivation and get myself in top shape."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy knew Osborne was subtly telling her to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hesitated for a second before adding, "I really owe you one. If you ever need a hand, just say the word. I'll do whatever I can."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "Really? Then how about this&mdash;leave your current team and help me make it into the top ten. And I won't even pay you a single Sacred Crystal. Would you still do it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she shook her head with a wry smile. "To be honest, I would! I know I don't stand a chance of making it into the top ten myself. Since I'm just a sidekick anyway, it doesn't really matter who I'm backing. But my current team was put together by the higher-ups at Azure Haven Academy... I can't just quit, so..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne burst out laughing. "I was just joking. Don't take it to heart! I don't need your thanks either. If you really want to thank someone, go thank Ms. Olsen! Because it was her who couldn't bear to see you get messed up and told me to wrap up the fight quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy nodded. "Ms. Olsen, eh?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll thank her! But I still want to thank you. Anyway, I owe you one..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After chatting a bit more, Leroy took her leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought for a second and quickly grabbed a wooden sign. He scribbled "Already on a team, no more invitations" on it and hung it on the courtyard gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He figured with that sign up, no one would come pestering him to join their team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But much to Osborne's surprise, not long after, there was a knock on the courtyard gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne peeked outside and saw a group of three guys and two girls. He didn't recognize any of them. They'd obviously seen the sign, but they just kept knocking on the door. That made Osborne's brows knit in irritation right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I've clearly stated on the sign that I'm not taking any more invitations. So why are they still bugging me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Don't they have any common sense?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was pretty ticked off and didn't want to deal with them. But they just wouldn't stop knocking, like they weren't going to give up. He had no choice but to open the door again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want?" Osborne asked, trying hard to hold back his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Osborne opened the gate, the man leading the group spoke up with an air of superiority, "You're Osborne, right? The champion from Tempest Fortress City, ranked 108th on the strength </span><span>leaderboard</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, asking, "Yeah, that's me. What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man, with a dismissive tone, said, "Let me introduce myself. I'm Conrad Maurice. I'm here to invite you to join my team. Thirty thousand Sacred Crystals&mdash;what do you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pointed to the wooden sign and replied coolly, "Did you miss the sign? And thirty thousand Sacred Crystals to join your team? Are you joking? The going rate for someone ranked between 100th and 150th is around fifty thousand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they make it into the top ten, that doubles. Even for those ranked 150th to 200th, it's still around thirty thousand. I'm ranked 108th, and you think thirty thousand is enough to get me on board?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, not interested." With that, Osborne started to close the gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another man behind Conrad stepped forward, his voice icy. "Hold it right there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, what's with the attitude? Mr. Maurice is doing you a favor by even considering you for his team. He's ranked 1</span><span>5</span><span>th on the leaderboard. You should be honored he's giving you the time of day!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're ranked one hundred and eighth. What's there for you to be proud of? Mr. Maurice personally came to invite you; that's already a solid endorsement! If you play your cards right with him, it could really boost your future prospects!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seriously, and you're complaining that it's not enough?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like you don't know how to appreciate a good offer! All five of us are in the top one hundred of the strength </span><span>leaderboard</span><span>. What makes you so special? How dare you turn down Mr. Maurice? Just so you know, on the state duel battlefield, any one of us could wipe the floor with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man leaned in closer, his gaze piercing, making it clear that Osborne better rethink his stance. It was an unspoken threat&mdash;apologize to Conrad or face the consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, couldn't help but chuckle in response to their bravado.</span></p><div class="pagination">
