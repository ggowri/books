  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Abner has been defeated!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Williamson family members stared in disbelief as Abner, ranked 320th in the Godson Rankings, fell quickly before Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They watched in fury as Osborne held Abner's divine artifact, the massive battle blade.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Put down the Williamson family's divine artifact!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're dead meat!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne responded with a cold smile, "Put it down? Why would I? According to our wager, now that he's lost, this divine artifact belongs to me."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Osborne casually stashed the divine artifact into the Dimensional Space.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had little interest in weapons shaped like great swords.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne preferred his own fists or weapons like axes, scythes, and spears. Besides, Abner's divine artifact was merely an Ordinary divine artifact, and any of Osborne's own artifacts were stronger.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Still, it was a divine artifact, and even if Osborne had no use for it, he could always gift it to someone else.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Smiling faintly, Osborne said, "I'm feeling a bit tired now. I'll head back and rest. There's no need for you to see me off."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, he strolled towards the courtyard. The younger members of the Williamson family glared at his retreating figure, their anger palpable. Many of them looked like they wanted to pounce, but they held themselves back.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, Osborne was back in the courtyard.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He found a lounge chair and relaxed, basking in the sunlight at the entrance. The Williamson family members passing by could all see him, and his nonchalant demeanor only fueled their rage.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn it! This jerk is treating our place like a vacation spot!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We're dying to make him pay, and he's still lounging around, soaking up the sun? Doesn't he have any respect for us?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Does he think he can just disrespect the Williamson family like this??"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Unbelievable!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Williamson family members watched Osborne from a distance, their anger mounting.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Someone with a cold voice said, "Don't worry, everyone. We've suffered a huge loss, and we won't let him get away with it. He's probably sticking around because he knows he can't leave yet and is waiting for reinforcements."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But this is Tethynia, our turf! Even if he has backup, we're not scared! The higher-ups in the Williamson family will make him pay!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With those words, the tension in the room eased slightly, though their eyes remained steely as they watched Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, inside the Williamson Castle. Someone said, "Master, that damned Axell used the Volt Hammer to defeat Abner and took Abner's divine artifact blade. He's now back in the courtyard, lounging in the sun.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I suspect that he's waiting for reinforcements from the Lambert family."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin sneered, saying, "Waiting for reinforcements from the Lambert family? What a joke!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is Tethynia, our territory, not Rosmandi! He's ruined our plans, humiliated my son Cuthbert, and made us lose face.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He thinks he can leave Tethynia alive? He's dreaming!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin's eyes flashed with murderous intent as he continued, "Keep a close watch on him! As soon as he leaves the Williamson family grounds, act immediately! He has two of our divine artifacts, and we need to reclaim them.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If the Lambert family sends a Class S Supreme Overlord to Tethynia to pick him up, I'll handle it personally!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The senior members of the Williamson family nodded in agreement.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Cuthbert's voice was icy as he declared, "Dad, I want to kill him with my own hands!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert's physical wounds had mostly healed, but his emotional scars had deepened.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During his Honor Quest Ceremony, he had been publicly humiliated by Osborne, who had stomped on his head in front of everyone. The humiliation had festered into a burning hatred, driving Cuthbert to fantasize about tearing Osborne apart.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Only blood can cleanse this dishonor!" Cuthbert thought.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin regarded Cuthbert thoughtfully before nodding and saying, "Very well! You lost to him, so only by defeating him yourself and cruelly exacting your revenge can you assuage your hatred and free yourself from this torment.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Otherwise, you'll never break through to Class S!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Go, and do what needs to be done!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a determined expression, Cuthbert said, "Don't worry, Dad. I'll defeat him and make him suffer. In a fair fight, I'll take him down easily."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Cuthbert strode out.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin's expression darkened as he muttered under his breath, "Send out the orders immediately! Lock down all of Tethynia. That brat has spatial powers and might try to escape through interdimensional travel. But against me, spatial powers are useless!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll use my supreme abilities to freeze the space within a 1640-foot radius around the Williamson Castle. As a Class S Supreme Overlord, it's beneath me to get directly involved, so you all will assist Cuthbert. No matter what, he must die!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As long as he lives, the Williamson family will bear this stain of shame!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With his icy resolve clear, the senior members of the Williamson family sprang into action.</p><div class="pagination">
