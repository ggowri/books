  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Karl disappeared, Derek finally rose to his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression was grim. "Spread the word, everyone is to set up at the diamond mine. In three days, I want Skyefall Security Services to make sure there's no coming back for them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the seven ancient Skyefall families, the one with the longest lineage was the Lark family. From the first ancestor to the present day, they had surpassed a millennium in existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Typically, 70% of the wealthy families saw their fortunes decline by the second generation and 90% by the third.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the wealth of the Lark family had endured for a thousand years without faltering, growing stronger with each passing generation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This longevity was attributed to the meticulous upbringing system within the Lark family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The descendants received top-notch education from a young age, ensuring that only the most exceptional individuals could manage the family's wealth and lead them to continued greatness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The current standout of the Lark family was Orion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike the arrogant Apollo, Orion was modest but possessed even greater strength. From a young age, he harbored ambitions to make the Lark family the most potent ancient lineage in Rosmandi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, such ambitions required a different approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion said earnestly to Gabriel Lark, the head of the family, "Dad, I intend to propose to the Radcliffe family! With Apollo gone and his engagement to Clarissa dissolved, now is my prime opportunity to marry her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa is the Fatebearer of the Radcliffe family, carrying immense destiny power. The renowned prophetess Helen Theron stated that marrying her could lead to soaring heights, but only if one can bear her fate power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I must marry Clarissa to lead our Lark family beyond Skyefall, to become the most powerful family in Rosmandi, and perhaps even in the world!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion's resolve was unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gabriel's expression turned grave. "Have you made up your mind? Remember, Helen also mentioned that only someone with sufficient status, background, and talent can bear the weight of Clarissa's fate power. Otherwise, marrying her could lead not to success but to a fatal end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did Apollo perish? It's likely because he sought to marry Clarissa, only to be consumed by her fate power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion said confidently, "Dad, I am not like Apollo. I am certain I can bear the weight of Clarissa's fate power. The Lark family, in terms of heritage and power, surpasses the Chevalier family. We are simply more discreet, not as boastful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I, Orion, surpass Apollo in status, background, talent, and strength. I am more qualified than Apollo to marry Clarissa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gabriel fell silent for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, he said, "Yet, I fear the unexpected. You are the most outstanding heir of our Lark family. We have stood for centuries without a spatial power in our lineage. You're the only one who has it. If something were to happen to you, it would be a loss our family cannot bear."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, what venture comes without risks? As long as I can marry Clarissa and propel the Lark family to greatness, I am willing to take the chance," Orion responded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gabriel took a deep breath. "Very well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go ahead and propose to the Radcliffe family. I trust they will make the right choice. If they refuse... well, the entire Lark family will be your shield. We will apply pressure on the Radcliffe family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion chuckled at Gabriel's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, Dad, I will definitely marry Clarissa. No one can stop me, or else I'll send them straight to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion waved his hand abruptly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before him, a crack appeared in the void, pitch black like a gateway to hell, immensely terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Gabriel was filled with shock and delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Orion, have you reached Class B+ already?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion nodded confidently. "That's right! Just recently, I've achieved Class B+. Father, I'll go prepare for the proposal right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, at the Radcliffe Manor, Donna put down her phone, furrowing her brows tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt Donna, what did Grandpa say?" Clarissa asked curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna sighed, "He said that after news of Apollo's death spread, many people rushed to propose marriage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But as of now, there hasn't been anyone he finds suitable. He wants me to keep a close eye on you, ensuring your safety. Possibly, the family will arrange a new engagement for you soon, and once it's decided, you'll have to marry immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's lovely face turned pale in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa wants to arrange a new engagement for me? And once it's decided, I have to marry right away? Why do they have the right to do this? Have they even asked for my opinion?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna looked at her sympathetically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, don't worry. Nothing has been confirmed yet, right? Apollo's death was so sudden that some in the family say it was because he was overwhelmed by your fate power. Others say things have been going wrong for the Radcliffe family recently because you haven't married yet, and your fate power is backfiring on the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, that's why they are eager to marry you off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's expression was filled with sorrow. She was about to say something when Barlyn barged in abruptly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn's face was grave as he quickly said, "Mom, the heir of the Lark family, Orion, is here. He says he's come to propose to Clarissa!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
