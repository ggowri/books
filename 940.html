  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Aberrants was launching a true all-out invasion, its ambitions set on seizing control of the entire Rosmandi, snatching away everything that belonged to the Augustine family and the Draco Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, they wouldn't be satisfied with just taking a few Draco Group headquarters or seizing a handful of rare metal mines. Their sights were set on total domination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had just managed to rescue a few members of the Draco Armed Services Branch when the Draco Star Wristlet began to tremble violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glanced down, his expression shifting to one of alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena was sending out a distress signal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Campbell headquarters was under siege by the Aberrants!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Campbell was located in the interior province, and Osborne had sent Serena and her team there to gather any surviving members of the Draco Armed Services Branch and set up a defensive strategy. He had figured that the Aberrants would take their time before making a move on Campbell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he was dead wrong&mdash;their invasion was faster than he had anticipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Aberrants' forces were relentlessly attacking the Campbell headquarters. Despite Serena rallying over a thousand strong warriors from the Draco Armed Services Branch, they were struggling to hold their ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why she had reached out to him for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face darkened. The remaining members of the Draco Armed Services Branch were at Campbell headquarters; if the Aberrants breached their defenses, they would all be doomed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Draco Armed Services Branch would be effectively destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to go save them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, Osborne tore open a dimensional rift and quickly pulled the injured Draco Armed Services members with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a series of interdimensional travels, they finally arrived at the Draco Group headquarters in Campbell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What they found was chaos&mdash;a fierce battle was underway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The combatants numbered over three thousand, with about a thousand being members of the Draco Armed Services Branch, who were desperately holding the line behind the defenses of their headquarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart sank as he took in the scene. The Aberrants was launching an aggressive attack, and its members outnumbered and outmatched the defenders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their line was crumbling, and it was clear that the situation was dire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were over two thousand of the Aberrants' warriors!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weakest among them were Class AA, but there were also more than three hundred Class AAA clones and upwards of ten Class S clones in the mix!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight sent a chill down Osborne's spine. No matter how confident he felt, he doubted he could fend off such a massive onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten Class S clones?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that harrowing encounter with just three, Osborne knew he had to tread carefully; facing ten would likely spell his doom, even if he laid every trick of his on the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, in addition to those ten Class S clones, there were still three hundred Class AAA clones and over a thousand Class AA clones. The sheer numbers were daunting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't win this..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression was grim as Osborne chose to hide not far from the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one noticed him amidst the chaos, but he couldn't stay in the shadows for long. Serena and her team were nearing their breaking point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Aberrants' onslaught was brutal. Not only did they outnumber the defenders, but their ferocity was terrifying, charging headlong without a second thought for their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like watching a stampede, especially from those terrifying Duke Taurens. The impact of their charges was catastrophic. Even the Class AAA warriors of the Draco Armed Services Branch were too frightened to hold their ground against a Duke Tauren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One blow would leave them shattered, broken, and bleeding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fortified headquarters of Campbell was crumbling under the relentless onslaught, inch by inch, teetering on the brink of total collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a wave of urgency wash over him; he couldn't afford to wait any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He understood that even if he jumped into the fray, he couldn't turn the tide, but Osborne knew that if he didn't act soon, the Campbell headquarters would fall, and everyone inside would perish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!" Osborne shouted, launching himself into the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His immediate target was the Duke Tauren. Their destructive power was overwhelming, and their defense was nearly impenetrable. The members of the Draco Armed Services Branch were hopeless against them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even someone as formidable as Serena, a top-tier Class AAA, found it challenging to inflict serious damage on the Duke Tauren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne refrained from activating the Light Realm; in such chaotic warfare, a collective strike from the enemy could shatter it like glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasting energy on the Light Realm was simply not practical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill! Deadly Force!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With one hand wielding the Goddess of Grain's scythe and the other channeling Deadly Force, Osborne charged at the front lines of Duke Tauren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his current strength, handling the Class AAA Duke Tauren was a walk in the park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether it was the scythe or the Deadly Force, both were capable of taking them down in a heartbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Osborne felled several Duke Taurens, sending their frantic assault spiraling into chaos.</span></p><div class="pagination">
