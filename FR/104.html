That terrifying sound sent a chill to everyone's </span><span>spine</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawke, please, spare me! I truly know I was wrong!" Her voice was completely different now, trembling and hoarse. Each word seemed to be torn from her throat, filled with endless despair and fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears flowed uncontrollably down her face, ruining the intricate makeup she had spent so much time perfecting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She no longer exuded the arrogant confidence she once had. Now, she resembled a terrified, helpless animal, cornered by a hunter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She kept apologizing, her voice hoarse and pained. Her tears fell relentlessly, making her appear utterly pitiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her forehead had been injured in the earlier chaos, blood trickling from the wound and forming small red beads that slid down her cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those around her were frozen, stunned by her tragic appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some turned away, unable to watch the heartbreaking scene. Others gaped, eyes wide with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After witnessing Julian's brutal punishment of Bertha and the four rich wives, everyone was acutely aware of how ruthless he could be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy was the mastermind behind the bullying of Aurora. It was clear to all that </span><span>whatever punishment awaited her now would be even more merciless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With an icy, unyielding gaze, </span><span>Julian</span><span> </span><span>looked down upon Judy, who was crumpling at his feet</span><span>.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his sharp chin slightly and turned to Ethan, his voice low but filled with undeniable authority. "Take her into the private room."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan immediately nodded and, accompanied by a few </span><span>bulky</span><span> </span><span>bodyguards, stepped forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their strong hands gripped Judy's arms like iron claws, forcibly pulling her away from Julian's feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, no! Let me go!" Judy struggled </span><span>like crazy</span><span>, her legs kicking aimlessly, her nails scraping against the floor with a screeching sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her screams shattered the oppressive silence in the banquet hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been married to Anderson for over twenty years. </span><span>So, s</span><span>he </span><span>knew Julian's methods well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He vent</span><span>ed</span><span> it all out in public because he was well prepared</span><span> and fearless</span><span>. And whatever he did behind closed doors was always much worse. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would never leave any trace, never allow anyone to catch hold of his weakness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, he had wanted to sever the fingers of the four rich women, but he had ordered their husbands to do it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if the police came, it would only be classified as a domestic dispute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian was cold-blooded, ruthless, and always managed to operate in the gray areas of the law, leaving no evidence behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a devil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, spare me!" Judy's voice was shrill and desperate as her body was dragged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson's face turned pale when he saw this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rushed forward, blocking their way. "Julian, Judy is your stepmother. You can't do this to her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian slowly turned his head, his eyes like blades aimed at Anderson. "If you're so reluctant to let her go, how about you take her place?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was cold, carrying the sharp bite of winter's winds. It felt as though the temperature had dropped several degrees in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson was stunned by this, his face flushing bright red, from the back of his neck to his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His son speaking to him so disrespectfully</span><span>, especially in front of so many people, was unbearable to him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His anger flared up, boiling inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Julian, I won't allow you to harm her, no matter what!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he stepped forward with determination, spreading his arms to </span><span>shield</span><span> </span><span>Judy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flicker of hope flashed in Judy's eyes. She lunged at Anderson, grabbing his arm desperately as if it were her only lifeline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anderson, </span><span>help</span><span> </span><span>me!" she cried, helpless and pitiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's expression grew colder. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he gave the order. "Well, your love is truly moving. Then take him as well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguards immediately moved forward, grabbing Anderson's arms on either side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson struggled fiercely, twisting his body to break free from their grip, shouting, "Julian, I'm your father! You can't do this to me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he turned to Beatrice, asking, </span><span>"Mom, are you really going to watch Julian do something so heartless?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice, who had been watching coldly up until now, hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian was her grandson, but Anderson was her son, and she couldn't </span><span>do nothing about it</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Julian..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could continue, Julian interrupted her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was respectful, yet filled with unwavering authority. "Grandmother, I know what I'm doing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice sighed softly, resigned. She closed her eyes</span><span> and kept quiet</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew well that Julian had suffered far too much pain </span><span>when he was little to have any love left for his father</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Julian was five, his biological mother had been driven to death by Judy, the mistress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, </span><span>he was no longer the boy full of laughter</span><span>.</span><span> He became gloomy instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She remembered the day Judy married Anderson, when little Julian, consumed by rage, had rushed into </span><span>their bedroom</span><span> with a knife, almost killing both Judy and Anderson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had shouted at them, chilling everyone in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if I kill you, I won't be held accountable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A five-year-old child, once innocent and carefree, was now filled with nothing but hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From that moment on, Julian had repeatedly attempted to kill Judy and Anderson, but being too young, his efforts had failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While most stepparents were cruel to their stepchildren, Judy was genuinely terrified of Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She feared him to the core, always trying to avoid him whenever they crossed paths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Julian was someone who would not hesitate to kill her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had worked so hard to marry into a rich family, but now she feared for her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she were killed, no one would be punished. After all, Julian was still a minor at the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Julian grew older, he learned to hide his emotions and bury his hatred deep inside. It had been a long time since he'd acted out in public like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The banquet hall was filled with stunned silence, everyone frozen in place, unsure of what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha and Adolph were completely terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson and Judy's desperate struggles seemed futile in the face of the bodyguards' strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment the private room door closed, a woman's blood-curdling scream echoed from within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound sliced through the air like a blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, a man's terrified cry followed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people outside stood frozen, afraid to move or even breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The banquet hall was deathly still, only the distant sounds of screams and cries from the private room filling the air, each echo quickening their heartbeats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one knew what was happening inside, but Judy's heart-wrenching screams alone were enough to </span><span>scare the hell out of them</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time stretched on, </span><span>and minutes felt like hours</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the private room grew quieter, and then everything fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door to the private room creaked open with a soft squeak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the horrified and curious gazes of the crowd, Judy was dragged out, looking like a puppet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her arms and legs were twisted at grotesque angles, clearly broken. The skin around the broken bones bulged, as though it might burst at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her once beautiful face was now covered in slashes, no part of her skin unscathed. Blood mixed with torn flesh dripped down her cheeks in a gruesome display.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mouth was full of blood, and her teeth were knocked out, leaving only bloody gums. The smell of blood filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was tossed to the ground, curled up in a ball, unmoving. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the faintest of breaths indicated she was still alive. Everyone realized from the sight that she </span><span>was just a step away from hell</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson was dragged out like a ragdoll, his body limp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were no visible wounds on him, but his eyes were vacant, as though his soul had left his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lips trembled, but no sound came out. His mind had shattered, as though he had endured unspeakable mental torture, leaving him mentally broken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian walked toward them with an elegant stride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked down at Judy and Anderson, his voice light as he spoke, "Domestic issues, it seems. Mrs. Judy Hawke attempted to punish Mr. Anderson Hawke by harming herself. Fortunately, my people acted swiftly, or the consequences could have been unimaginable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was casual, even carrying a faint smile, but in his eyes, there was only a cold, terrifying indifference.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="103.html">« Prev</a><a href="105.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
