Finally, he pushed himself up and walked to his bedroom where Aurora was in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At the door, his hand froze on the handle. The closed door felt like a wall between them - him out here, Aurora lying sick inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What was wrong with him? He'd always thought she deserved everything she got. So why did seeing her like this make his chest hurt so much?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sir?" A servant's voice cut through his thoughts. "The guests are arriving for Ms. Elvador's birthday party. They're waiting for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Barnett lingered, looking at the door one last time before turning away with a heavy sigh and following the servant downstairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the banquet hall, Bertha stood surrounded by a crowd, looking every bit like a princess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She stood before an ornate cake as the guests sang "Happy Birthday" in unison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She inhaled deeply as the song came to an end, then leaned forward and extinguished all the candles with a single breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The room erupted in cheers and applause, with colorful balloons and streamers dancing overhead in the celebration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Barnett stood amidst the crowd, watching the sea of joyous faces. But all he could think of was Aurora, weak and pale, lying helplessly on the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He wanted to smile, but his lips wouldn't move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Barnett slipped away from the cake-cutting crowd, finding refuge near the champagne tower. He grabbed a glass and knocked it back in one shot, not caring as some spilled down his chin and onto his shirt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">One glass turned into three, then five. Each drink trying to numb the guilt eating him up inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The room started spinning, party noise fading into a weird buzz. His head swimming, he barely managed to keep his balance as he stumbled toward the exit, desperate to escape the suffocating atmosphere of the banquet hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He barely made it to the bathroom before his stomach lurched. Stumbling to the sink, he heaved until there was nothing left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Spent, he slumped against the counter, sucking in deep breaths. His head started to clear as the nausea subsided.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cold water from the tap shocked his system as he splashed his face, bringing him back to reality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gripping the edges of the sink, he forced himself to look in the mirror.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His dark hair was plastered to his skin, water running down his angular face, making him look more gaunt than usual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He let out a harsh laugh. "This is stupid. Why am I beating myself up? I'm losing it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His phone buzzed in his pocket.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Morgan's name lit up the screen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Barnett quickly wiped his face before answering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yeah?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Hey, Mr. Elvador. Got that info you asked for."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Tell me." Barnett's voice was cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Morgan went quiet for a moment. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Barnett frowned. "What's the matter?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Listen, boss..." Morgan hesitated. "You might want to sit down for this. It's... it's pretty rough."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Barnett's chest constricted, but he steeled himself. "Just tell me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He heard Morgan exhale heavily before starting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Boss, they... they tortured her in there. Daily beatings, made her drink from toilets, wouldn't let her sleep. They'd stick her with needles if she didn't do what they wanted. The guards... they humiliated her constantly..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Barnett's grip on the phone tightened, his breathing ragged. Through gritted teeth, he demanded, "Needles? Where would they even get needles in prison?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"They made her do labor in the prison workshop, so..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Veins bulged on Barnett's forehead as he fought to suppress his rage. "Go on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"The worst part? They broke six batons beating her legs. Shattered the bones. Had to rush her to the ER."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Barnett's whole body shook, his eyes turning red with rage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"There's more," Darren continued quietly. "Someone was pulling strings in there. The inmates who attacked her all got time off their sentences. It wasn't random."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"And last year... she ended up in the hospital again. Don't know what happened, but it was bad. After that, they moved her to solitary. Nobody touched her after that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Barnett's hands curled into fists, his voice barely a whisper. "Who?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Morgan, who'd been his right hand since day one at the company, caught the meaning instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Adolph Sherwood, sir."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The name hit Barnett like a punch to the gut.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Camille's brother. The man engaged to Bertha.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The man who should've been Aurora's fianc&eacute; - she was the true Elvador daughter, after all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The room suddenly felt ice-cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Barnett's silence stretched on for so long that Morgan tentatively asked, "Mr. Elvador?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Cancel all collaborations with Sherwood Group. Launch a full-scale attack on their businesses," Barnett said, his voice hoarse but as cold as ice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Morgan felt a chill run down his spine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Boss, we'll take losses too if we go that route."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I don't care. Do it. And make sure everyone who touched her pays for it. Inside those prison walls."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"On it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Barnett's phone slipped from his grip, his arms dead at his sides. His mind tortured him with visions of Aurora - beaten, helpless, alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She used to be a carefree girl with a bright smile. Now, she was unrecognizable from all the torment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Yes, she had made mistakes, but the law had already sentenced her to five years. He didn't think she deserved this kind of abuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After a long time, Barnett left the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Once again, he stood before the bedroom door. It took considerable effort to steel himself before he pushed it open.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But before he could step inside, Aurora's low, pleading voice reached his ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm sorry... I was wrong... Please don't hit me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her murmured pleas, spoken in the grip of a nightmare, cut into Barnett like a knife, sapping all his courage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He quickly shut the door, blocking out her voice, and staggered back to the study.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The night dragged on, and the study stayed dark.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Barnett's phone buzzed incessantly, ringing for so long that it eventually disconnected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In another room, Joshua's phone jolted him from sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yeah?" he mumbled, fumbling for the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The news snapped him awake. "WHAT?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His yell startled Celeste beside him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What the hell are you screaming about?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Barnett just axed everything with Sherwood. Ten billion - gone, just like that!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No way!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Adolph just called me himself, demanding answers!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Joshua threw the covers off, storming out of the room. Furious, he kicked open Barnett's bedroom door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Joshua burst into the room. "Barnett, get up! Why did you end..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His words trailed off when he saw Aurora on the bed, completely stunned.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="9.html">« Prev</a><a href="11.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
