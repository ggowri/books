You can't treat me like this!" Her voice shrieked with sharp desperation, echoing through the banquet hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguards remained unmoved. Their iron-like grips held Bertha's arms firmly, pressing her down to her knees, forcing her to bow at Aurora's feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha abruptly turned her head, catching Aurora's gaze, which was as calm and distant as the night sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, she felt like a worthless insect, crushed beneath someone's boot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Images of all the times she had stood tall, mocking and tormenting Aurora, flooded her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, she had always looked down on Aurora, treating her as someone beneath her, mercilessly trampling on her dignity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, the tables had turned. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha fought to hold back the overwhelming humiliation threatening to drown her. She tried to put on a facade of fragile vulnerability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled up in her eyes, quickly pooling and shimmering in the corners. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice trembled with feigned sorrow. "Aurora, why are you letting Mr. Hawke do this to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears spilled down her pale cheeks, each drop sliding like a silent confession of her </span><span>helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked like a delicate flower caught in a violent storm, on the verge of withering, invoking pity in anyone who saw her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Aurora remained silent, standing still, her gaze mocking and cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Bertha saw that Aurora wasn't moved, anger flared inside her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly turned her tearful gaze toward Julian, her eyes full of pleading hope. She hoped her pitiful appearance could soften his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what she didn't know was that Julian's heart was as cold as stone. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how much she cried, no matter how innocent she seemed, to him, it was all a pathetic charade, a joke that didn't stir even the slightest emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without the slightest hesitation</span><span>,</span><span> he commanded,</span><span> "Do it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shaving blade came down, and Bertha felt a chill shoot through her scalp, a bone-deep coldness that seemed to freeze her from the inside out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body began to tremble uncontrollably, and a desperate, guttural scream tore from her throat. "No! Please, no!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the razor moved, her </span><span>shiny</span><span> hair was slowly shaved off, falling to the cold, hard floor in disarray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha thrashed wildly, her body twisting and writhing in panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp blade nicked her scalp, and blood trickled down her cheek, staining her flawless skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha let out a heart-wrenching scream, a wail that echoed through the banquet hall and pierced the hearts of everyone who heard it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers, stunned by the brutal spectacle, went pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially the women who had tormented Aurora, their faces now drained of color, their legs shaking. It was as though they could see their own fate reflected in Bertha's suffering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaving a woman's head was a profound insult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with the blade cutting into Bertha's scalp, her hair follicles were likely destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a woman who valued her beauty above all else, this was nothing short of a catastrophe, a fate more cruel than death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy, witnessing this, collapsed to the ground. Her eyes were vacant as if her soul had already left her body, leaving only an empty shell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph, seeing Bertha's suffering, was consumed by panic. Rage surged through him like a firestorm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without thinking, he rushed toward her, shouting desperately, "Stop! Stop it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could even get close, Ethan kicked him in the chest, sending him flying backward, crashing heavily to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two bodyguards immediately stepped forward, pinning him down, and keeping him on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph thrashed violently, his voice dripping with fury. "Julian, how dare you do this to Bertha? I will never let this go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were bloodshot, his face contorted in rage. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to Julian, his threats were nothing more than the pitiful squeaks of an ant. </span><span>He </span><span>wouldn&rsquo;t even be bothered to spare him another glance</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With no response from Julian, Adolph turned his fury toward Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, Bertha is your sister! How can you just stand there and watch her suffer like this? Are you a monster?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora sneered, her voice sharp and biting, "It's been over a month. Camille should be able to speak by now, right? Did she not tell you who the real culprit is, or did you stop her from saying it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph's face drained of color in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason he had sent Camille abroad was to prevent her from revealing the truths he didn't want to hear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to act like nothing had happened. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With cowardly thoughts running through his head, he convinced himself that as long as Camille didn't speak, nothing wrong</span><span> had happened</span><span>, and he could still justify everything he had done to Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He refused to discuss Camille any further, quickly changing the topic. "I'm your fianc&eacute;, yet you </span><span>hooked up</span><span> with another man. </span><span>Shame on you! </span><span>Aurora, you better tell them to stop, or I will never forgive you</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora only looked at him silently. His accusations and insults sounded to her like a clown's pathetic performance, making her feel nothing but ridicule.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian frowned, his voice cold and cutting. "Too noisy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan understood immediately. He quickly pulled off his socks and without hesitation</span><span>,</span><span> stuffed them into Adolph's mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph's eyes went wide in horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He writhed, trying to break free from the bodyguards' hold, but it was useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He desperately tried to spit out the socks, but no matter how hard he tried, it remained lodged in his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disgusting smell filled his mouth, almost making him gag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he could manage were muffled, incoherent noises, helplessly watching as Bertha's hair was shaved away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha lay on the floor, her eyes empty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strange, eerie silence filled the banquet hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's gaze shifted slightly, coldly sweeping over the four wealthy women who had once helped Judy torment Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His stare, as chilling as a winter storm, caused them, and their husbands, to tremble uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawke, we didn't know she was with you. If we had known, we never would have laid a hand on her," one of the women spoke first, her voice shaking, her eyes filled with both fear and ingratiation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! We heard she was trying to seduce Mr. Anderson Hawke, and we acted in a moment of anger. We thought we were doing the right thing. Please, forgive us. We didn't know!" Another woman quickly joined in, her face a mask of pleading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their husbands, too, chimed in, their voices dripping with false politeness. "Mr. Hawke, we've already taught them a lesson. They know they were wrong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian smirked slightly, his voice laced with cold sarcasm. "</span><span>But you seemed to be too </span><span>easy on your wives</span><span>. You've torn my woman's clothes off and exposed her to the public, practically naked in front of you.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think this is enough to make things right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four women went deathly pale. They realized then that Julian would never let them off the hook so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their husbands began to panic, desperately trying to explain, "Mr. Hawke, it's all a misunderstanding..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian showed a cruel smirk. "I'm not unreasonable. Since you admit your mistake, then accept the punishment.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Y</span><span>ou like to hit people so much, how about each of you leave behind a finger? Then, I'll have someone strip you naked and throw you out of the hotel for everyone to see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the chilling suggestion, the four women's faces turned ghostly white, drained of all color.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="101.html">« Prev</a><a href="103.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
