"Joshua, you heartless monster! I'm taking you down today!" she screamed, her voice raw with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every word she spat out was drenched in desperation and grief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd lost absolutely everything&mdash;her perfect little life had popped like a soap bubble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she looked back on 30 years, she realized her love had been this constant stream that never once ran dry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when they "accidentally" lost their daughter years ago, she'd just curled up alone night after night, crying silently in the dark, burying all that pain so deep because she couldn't bear to blame him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But what had he done in return?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd shoved their family off a cliff into complete destruction, leaving her totally ruined with everyone she loved gone. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How could anyone be that cruel?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua hissed in pain as her nails tore into his skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed her wrists, but Celeste was like a mama lion protecting her cubs&mdash;scarily strong at that moment&mdash;and he couldn't block her frenzied attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bloody scratches spread across his face as warm blood trickled down his cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Celeste, have you lost your mind?" Joshua roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lost my mind? Ha! Yeah, I've totally lost it!" Celeste laughed, a horrible sound full of hatred and utter hopelessness. "You destroyed my life, you absolute animal, and you have the nerve to ask if I've lost my mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something flickered in Joshua's eyes. He never imagined Celeste would discover what happened all those years ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recovered though, plastering a confused expression on his face. "What are you talking about? I don't understand a word you're saying," he said, playing dumb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste felt rage explode in her head when she heard this. Her entire body shook uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She violently hurled the documents straight at his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here's your proof! What do you have to say now?" Her voice cracked as tears welled up, her eyes flashing with unbridled fury and heartbreak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's heart practically stopped when he saw the contents. He felt like he'd been struck by lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All those secrets he'd buried for years&mdash;all those crimes he thought would be buried deep&mdash;suddenly slithered out like venomous snakes, surrounding him with nowhere to hide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face turned pale in an instant. He just stood there frozen, too shocked to even react, staring blankly at the documents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching his fa&ccedil;ade of decency crumble, Celeste felt her last shred of hope pop like a bubble. She was absolutely devastated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't lie to herself anymore. The man she'd loved with her heart for 30 years was a monster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought she was stabbed with a thousand needles, like invisible hands were ripping it apart. The pain was so intense she could barely breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anger, despair, regret&mdash;all these emotions swirled together into a violent storm that completely shattered her self-control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard!" she screamed, lunging at Joshua again like a starving tiger pouncing on prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She threw herself at him with reckless abandon, fighting like someone with absolutely nothing left to lose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her nails dug deep into his skin, each scratch carrying all the hatred she'd built up over the years. Blood trickled down his face and neck, leaving shocking red trails across his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua looked completely wrecked now, his face covered in bloody scratches, blood flowing freely&mdash;a total mess that looked genuinely horrific.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give me back my father! Give me back my son! Give me back my daughter!" Celeste demanded, her attacks getting more vicious with each accusation while tears streamed down her face like a broken dam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did I do to deserve this? Did our 30 years together mean nothing to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's leg&mdash;the one that had been broken twice by Ethan&mdash;hadn't fully healed yet. Against Celeste's frenzied attack, he could barely defend himself, let alone fight back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hands flailed in the air as he tried to block her assault. "Celeste, that's enough!" he kept shouting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Celeste was too blinded by rage to care. She wrapped her hands around Joshua's throat and squeezed, her knuckles turning white from the pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just die, you devil! I'm going to kill you!" Celeste's eyes were bloodshot with a look that said she wanted to rip him apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua struggled, trying to pry Celeste's hands away, but her grip around his neck was like iron&mdash;completely unbreakable no matter how hard he fought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes started rolling back in his head, showing nothing but whites, while his tongue pushed out between his lips in this totally horrifying way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thrashed wildly, hands flailing for anything to save him, his body twisting violently as his legs spasmed from pain and lack of oxygen, leaving the sheets in chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the hospital room, Aurora watched everything through the clear glass panel in the door with ice in her veins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd expected Celeste would just swallow her pain silently when faced with betrayal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But seeing Celeste fight back with such raw fury made Aurora suddenly realize that even Celeste had her breaking point&mdash;when hurt, betrayed, and pushed too far, she would finally snap back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora couldn't help but smirk. People never truly understood pain until the whip cracked against their own skin. It was impossible to truly empathize until then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora watched with a hint of amusement, not an ounce of sympathy in her eyes. She might as well have been watching strangers in a movie&mdash;completely detached and cold-blooded about the whole thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste had always been surrounded by luxury&mdash;money flowing like water, the finest clothes, the most extravagant vacations. But no matter how much she accumulated, she never felt rich in the one thing that mattered most: love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What she truly longed for, what she needed more than anything, wasn&rsquo;t wealth&mdash;it was someone who could truly see her, someone who would love her for who she was, not for what she had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, everything she'd ever cared about had vanished like a soap bubble popping&mdash;gone in an instant. She completely fell apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hatred for Joshua had sunk deep into her bones. Her hands stayed locked around his throat, refusing to let go no matter what.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua was moments away from death, thrashing desperately on the bed. His right hand scrambled frantically until his fingers found the fruit knife in the basket on the nightstand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, pure survival instinct took over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without thinking, he plunged the knife down toward Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blade made a sickening wet sound as it sank into flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste let out this bone-chilling scream that could've woken the dead&mdash;the kind that cuts straight through to one's soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hands instantly released his throat as she fell backward from the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood sprayed everywhere like a twisted fountain, splattering across Joshua's face. The warm wetness snapped him back from the edge of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua gulped down air like he'd been underwater for minutes, his chest heaving dramatically with each desperate breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he finally looked at Celeste again, his eyes went wide with horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fruit knife had stabbed directly into Celeste's left eye. Blood poured between her fingers as she clutched at her face, staining her hands completely red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rolled around on the ground, her body twisting in unnatural angles. Her screams bounced off the hospital walls, sending chills down anyone's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua stared at Celeste in total panic, voice breaking. "It&rsquo;s not my fault! You trying to choke me to death. I was just defending myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, he was completely lost, with no clue what to do next. But he pulled himself together pretty quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were married, after all&mdash;he'd only stabbed out one of Celeste's eyes. According to the law, this would just get labeled as a "domestic dispute" with a slap on the wrist and maybe some counseling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment this clicked, all his fear vanished, replaced by this cold, calculating calmness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed his phone and dialed Isabella right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, Isabella, get over to my hospital room now. That bitch Celeste found out about us. She just tried to strangle </span><span>me,</span><span> I stabbed her in the eye. Bring some people to drag her out of here&mdash;I can't stand looking at her anymore," he said with a disgusted look on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In excruciating pain, Celeste heard every one of Joshua's heartless words, her remaining eye burning with pure hatred.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She used every ounce of strength she had left, her voice dripping with venom. "Joshua, I hope you rot in hell."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="125.html">« Prev</a><a href="127.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
