"Barnett, I wasn't laughing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste was both shocked and furious. "Barnett, have you gone mad? You've frightened your sister."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett met her eyes and said, "Mom, is Bertha the only one you see? Is Aurora not your own daughter? She was driven to chop off her own finger last night. Can't you feel any pain for her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's face turned pale, and she stammered, "I... I naturally feel pain for her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was so faint it carried no weight at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett roared, "Then why, knowing full well that Bertha doesn't like salmon, did you give her the chowder instead of taking it to Aurora? Aurora is so thin. Mom, can't you see? Can't you tell who needs the nutrition more?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you have any idea what Aurora has lost? She..." Barnett stopped abruptly, unable to continue as he thought of Aurora's missing kidney.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At just twenty-three, she had spent five years in prison, broken her leg, and lost a kidney. Her future seemed bleak and finite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's eyes were bloodshot with pain. "Mom, Aurora is your own daughter. Can't you just be kind to her, for once?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste was speechless. Faced with Barnett's accusations, she felt deep guilt and tears began to fall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough!" Joshua barked, his face dark and menacing. "Watch your tongue! You're speaking to your mother!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm truly ashamed to have a daughter as morally corrupt as Aurora. She's malicious and deserves to be despised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She chopped off her own finger. No one forced her. I say both her hands should be cut off to keep her from pushing anyone else down the stairs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua was so furious that he spouted lies without blinking, convinced of his own righteousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett met his father's gaze, his face filled with disappointment. "When Mom gave birth to Aurora, she begged you to take care of her, but you fell asleep. That's why Aurora was stolen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If she hadn't been lost, she would have received a proper education and would be far more accomplished than Bertha. Ultimately, we owe her. So why do you say she deserves this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stolen at birth and raised in an orphanage, she lived the most miserable life despite being a wealthy heiress. Does she really deserve all this suffering?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Listening to Barnett's scathing and unrelenting accusations, Joshua felt his blood rush to his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes blazed with rage, the humiliation of his shattered authority burning within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You ungrateful son!" Joshua raised his hand and slapped Barnett hard across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force of the blow sent Barnett's head snapping to the side, and blood seeped from the corner of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last flicker of hope in his eyes was extinguished at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only after Aurora had lost her hand, broken her leg, lost a kidney, and become an invalid, did he finally feel a pang of conscience and want to treat her better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it seemed it was all too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett forced a bitterly ironic smile, which looked even more jarring against the blood on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he laughed, hot tears finally burst forth, streaming down his cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora must deeply regret ever coming back to this family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett wiped the blood from his mouth and turned to Daisy without another glance at Joshua, Celeste, or Bertha. "Daisy, take the food to Aurora. Buy her whatever she wants. And if anyone tries to take it from her, I won't hesitate to cut off their hand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was as cold and hard as ice, sending a chill down everyone's spine.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="30.html">« Prev</a><a href="32.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
