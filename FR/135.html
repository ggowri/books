Not hearing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frowning slightly, she tried again, this time with a bit more urgency and warmth in her tone. "Aurora?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But still, the only response was the bubbling sound of the oatmeal in the pot. Aurora remained focused, gently stirring the thick, fragrant mixture. It had been simmering for over an hour, filling the kitchen with a rich aroma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's gaze locked onto Aurora's frail figure, an uneasy feeling tightening in her chest. Her voice grew louder, nearly a shout. "Aurora!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her call reverberated through the kitchen, yet Aurora remained unresponsive as if trapped in a world of silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's body trembled, a chilling realization creeping over her. She was sure that Aurora couldn't hear her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last time she saw her in the hospital, she had been fine. But she had lost her hearing in such a short time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's hands clenched into tight fists, her nails digging into her palms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Elvador</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> family, Adolph, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Hubery</span><span style="font-style: italic;">, those scumbags... What have they done to her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rage surged through her, anger burning in her eyes. If she could, she would tear apart everyone who had hurt Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Aurora turned around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment her eyes landed on Lily, her once calm gaze lit up with surprise and joy. A warm smile spread across her face. "Lily, what are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily instantly concealed the fury in her eyes. She said with a bright, innocent smile, "I missed you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet her gaze never left Aurora's face, carefully searching for any trace of hidden pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora walked over with a gentle smile, affectionately taking Lily's hand. Her touch was soft and warm. "Lily, come, sit down. The oatmeal will be ready soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she started pulling Lily toward the living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily continued observing her closely, still feeling uneasy. "I'll help you in the kitchen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's smile deepened, filled with fondness. "The kitchen is full of smoke and oil. I can handle it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's heart tightened.</span><br><span>She responded to my words. Was I wrong?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">She can hear me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trying to appear casual, Lily said, "It's fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her persistence, Aurora didn't argue further. She turned back to the stove and resumed stirring the oatmeal. As she stirred, she added, "Then, Lily, you can fry some eggs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily took a step back, standing behind Aurora, and said, "I don't like fried eggs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this were before, Aurora would have immediately asked what she preferred instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, she simply said, "Eggs are in the fridge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That simple response hit Lily. She was even more certain now. Aurora couldn't hear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her previous responses weren't because she had heard her, but because she had read her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Aurora must have suffered immensely in prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily felt a sharp pain in her heart. Rage burned inside her, an uncontrollable inferno threatening to consume everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Everyone who hurt Aurora deserves to die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes stayed locked on Aurora's every movement. That was when she noticed something else. Aurora was limping. With each unsteady step, it felt like a knife twisting deeper into Lily's heart. Her eyes reddened slightly, a bitter ache spreading inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily suppressed the pain swelling in her chest, took a deep breath, and opened the refrigerator for the eggs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She moved to the stove, heating the pan before pouring in oil. The moment the eggs hit the </span><span>surface,</span><span> a sharp sizzling sound filled the kitchen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rich aroma of fried eggs soon spread through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A while later, the oatmeal was finally ready.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora carefully ladled the thick, steaming oatmeal into a large plate. Holding it steadily, she took slow, unsteady steps toward the dining table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as she reached the dining room, a sharp, enraged voice suddenly pierced the air. "You wretched woman! What are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A loud crash followed. The plate slipped from Aurora's hands, shattering against the floor. Pieces of ceramic flew everywhere, and the oatmeal splattered across the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora let out a startled gasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily, who had just stepped out of the kitchen with the fried eggs, witnessed a heavily made-up woman raising her hand to slap Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora panicked and dodged, but the scalding oatmeal splashed onto her hand. She let out a small cry of pain, and the plate she was holding fell to the ground as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's expression instantly turned cold, her sharp gaze locking onto the intruding woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, only one thought occupied her mind.</span><br><span>I must protect Aurora!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her, Aurora was one of the most important people in her life, a friend she would protect at all costs. And now, this arrogant woman dared to lay a hand on Aurora. She wouldn't let her do this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Lily stormed forward and slammed the scorching fried egg straight onto the woman's heavily painted face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A piercing scream echoed through the room, sharp and grating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The egg was searing hot, and the woman's skin immediately reddened and swelled from the burn. She frantically flailed, trying to pry Lily's hand off, her face twisting in pain and fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Lily didn't back down. She lunged again, grabbing the woman's hair and driving a vicious kick straight to her knee. With a sharp cry of pain, the woman collapsed onto the floor, landing with a heavy thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seizing the opportunity, Lily shoved the woman's face down into the mess of broken ceramic and steaming oatmeal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The jagged ceramic shards cut into the woman's skin, fresh blood mixing with the hot oatmeal, creating a grotesque scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman thrashed wildly, her hysterical cries filling the air. But Lily stood firm, her expression unreadable, filled with disgust and seething fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the man who had come with the woman snapped out of his daze. His face contorted in rage as he raised his foot to kick Lily away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's heart clenched. Without hesitation, she stepped in front of Lily, shielding her. She said loudly, "Mr. Sherwood, this is the Hawke Estate, not the Sherwood Estate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man froze, his hateful glare locked onto Aurora, his fury barely contained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This man was none other than Adolph's father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He and his wife had been vacationing abroad and had only returned last night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never expected to the shocking news that their beloved son, Adolph, had been thrown into prison by Julian. It hit them like a bombshell, keeping them awake all night in distress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the first light of dawn, they rushed to the Hawke Estate, hoping Julian would show them some mercy and release Adolph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they never imagined they would run into Aurora here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had caused their daughter, Camille, to become vegetative. It was the eternal wound in their hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During Aurora's five years in prison, they had secretly arranged for people to torment her, making her life a living hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, seeing the woman responsible for their daughter's fate standing before them, Lizeth lost control. Overcome with rage, she instinctively lashed out at Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What she didn't expect, however, was for Lily to be so fierce. She was humiliated by a wild girl and forced to sit in scorching oatmeal and shards of broken porcelain. The sheer disgrace was unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Wilson was staring daggers at Aurora, his eyes burning with hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting his teeth, he snarled, "You reckless little wretch! Don't think getting out of prison means you're in the clear. You dared to hurt my daughter. Must pay a heavy price for it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he raised his hand and swung it toward Aurora's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily turned back in horror, trying to stop him, but it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All she could do was shout, "If you dare lay a hand on Aurora, I'll cut yours off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the words left her mouth, Wilson's hand suddenly froze mid-air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't because he hesitated. It was because a strong hand had grabbed his wrist, rendering him powerless no matter how much strength he used.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora and Lily's gazes shifted to the person standing behind Wilson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian stood there, dressed in black pajamas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The loose fabric draped over his frame, revealing the sharp lines of his collarbone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hair was slightly tousled, but it did nothing to diminish his natural air of nobility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were cold, his lips pressed tightly, and his entire presence exuded a chilling, intimidating aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His aura was powerful and oppressive, impossible for others to meet his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wilson struggled with all his might, veins bulging on his forehead, his face turning a deep shade of red, yet he couldn't break free from Julian's grasp.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A crisp crack echoed through the room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With effortless precision, Julian dislocated Wilson's arm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wilson let out a scream and collapsed onto the ground. The very hand he had tried to strike Aurora with now hung limply, completely useless.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="134.html">« Prev</a><a href="136.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
