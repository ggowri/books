Aurora knew it must have been Julian who covered her medical expenses again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She owed Julian a huge favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's ears turned red with embarrassment. "I can embroider, and I can sell my work to make money. I just need some time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian leaned back in his chair with a playful expression, propping his chin with one hand. "But I don't need money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was stunned for a moment, thinking, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">That's right. Someone who drives a Rolls-Royce and collects bottles of wine worth hundreds of thousands of dollars wouldn't need money.</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> He&rsquo;s loaded already.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora felt her whole body burning. She and Julian were from two different worlds. She wanted to repay Julian but had nothing valuable to offer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then s</span><span>he lowered her head, feeling disheartened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then... Mr. Hawke, what do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian leaned back in his chair, gazing at her with a deep look as if pondering something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora felt uneasy under his gaze, her fingers tightly clutching the spoon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian observed Aurora's nervous demeanor and began to scheme in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Over the past few years, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">G</span><span style="font-style: italic;">randmo</span><span style="font-style: italic;">m</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> has been urging me to get married more frequently. Her eager and expectant eyes have been giving me a headache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">However, I've never been particularly interested in marriage. But my grandmother is clearly determined to see me wed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If I were to marry one of those scheming socialites, our marriage would undoubtedly be unpleasant. So, I might as well marry someone my grandmother likes and who won't cause me trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Aurora fits that criterion perfectly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Although her family situation is a bit messy, it's not a big deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If necessary, I can make the Elvador family go bankrupt, and they won't be able to cause any more trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Julian, bankrupting the Elvador family was as easy as drinking water, but he was worried Aurora wouldn't agree to his plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew a bit about Aurora's personality. She was kind and had strong self-respect. She would never accept his condition just because he had helped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few seconds later, he reached the conclusion - He shouldn&rsquo;t rush this. He </span><span>need</span><span>ed</span><span> to plan carefully and take it step by step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While thinking this, Julian's eyes never left Aurora. He was already calculating how to gradually guide her into the trap he had </span><span>set for her</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was completely unaware of Julian's thoughts. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt that Julian's gaze lingered on her for too long, and the overwhelming pressure made it hard for her to breathe as if she were being treated like prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>S</span><span>till, s</span><span>he forced herself to endure the pressure, telling herself, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">I must be overthinking this. Mr. Hawke is handsome and wealthy. He can have any woman he wants. There's no way he would be interested in a sickly person like me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked up and forced a smile. "Mr. Hawke, I will work hard to repay your money and the favor. Don't worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian raised an eyebrow slightly, his smile deepening. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was low and gentle. "No rush, I don't need you to repay me immediately. It just occurred to me that you might have something more valuable</span><span> to offer</span><span> than money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He deliberately paused to observe Aurora's reaction. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her confusion, he continued, "My grandmother's birthday is in a month. Didn't you promise to help me complete 'The Garden'? As long as your embroidery matches the original and no one can tell the difference, you'll have repaid my favor. How about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked up, a flash of surprise in her eyes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is that all? I was right about Mr. Hawke. He's truly a good person. He knows I don't have money, so he didn't make things difficult for me. He only asked me to complete </span><span style="font-style: italic;">"</span><span style="font-style: italic;">The Garden</span><span style="font-style: italic;">"</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I won't let you down." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was her work after all, and it was only fitting that she be the one to finish it. Aurora looked at Julian with gratitude in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian smiled faintly, "After you're discharged from the hospital, you'll stay at my place for the time being."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's eyes widened in shock. </span><span>It didn&rsquo;t sound like a good idea to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian added, "I want to oversee your work. Only then will I feel at ease."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora understood Julian's intention. </span><span style="font-style: italic;">That's the piece Mr. Hawke spent 20 million dollars on. He's worried I might damage it. I can understand that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora smiled, her eyes curving like crescents, "Alright."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's gaze deepened as he looked at Aurora</span><span>, feeling that she was easy to fool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's face flushed, and she quickly lowered her head to continue eating. Julian also went back to reading his book.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Occasionally, Aurora glanced up at his focused profile, feeling an inexplicable sense of comfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan stood outside the hospital room, his expression bitter and his brows tightly furrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just now, Joshua had called him. He had no idea how Joshua had gotten his number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's obsequious voice echoed in his mind, leaving him speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He</span><span> thought, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">At the last banquet, Joshua shamelessly tried to marry off his daughter to Mr. Hawke. That was already disgusting enough. Now he actually wants to arrange a dinner with a group of beauties to accompany Mr. Hawke. Joshua will stop at nothing to achieve his goals.</span><span>Ethan couldn't help but mutter, "He's tormented his own daughter to this state. What kind of good person could he be? How could he possibly think of currying favor with Mr. Hawke?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced through the glass window of the hospital room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was sitting quietly at the dining table, eating her meal, while Julian leaned against a chair by the window, engrossed in a book. Sunlight spilled over them, creating a harmonious atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sight, </span><span>Ethan felt a growing sense of sympathy for Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Orley Central Hospital, Joshua slammed his phone onto the bed, his face dark with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha was startled and quickly approached him. "Dad, what's wrong? Did Mr. Hawke still refuse?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua gritted his teeth and said fiercely, "That guy is so stubborn. I offered to give him that little bitch Aurora, and he refused. I even invited a few beauties to accompany him for dinner, and he still </span><span>turned me down</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua was so angry that he was breathing heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha frowned, unable to believe it. "Rumors say Julian </span><span>is a womanizer</span><span>. How could he refuse you repeatedly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who knows?" Joshua grew angrier the more he thought about it. He punched the table, causing everything on it to shake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they couldn't secure the East Suburb project, the Elvador Group would </span><span>not stand firm</span><span> in Orley. This thought made him extremely anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha's eyes darted around, and suddenly she said, "Dad, do you think it's possible that the rumors are wrong? Maybe Julian isn't interested in women after all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua frowned, deep in thought. "Whether he is or not, we must get involved in the East Suburb project. Since he's not interested in these offers, we'll have to change our approach."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bertha thought for a moment and said, "Dad, I heard Beatrice's birthday is next month. Why don't we prepare a generous gift? Maybe we can use this opportunity to build a friendship with the Hawke family."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="76.html">« Prev</a><a href="78.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
