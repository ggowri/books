Then she told Frank this news with a worried heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To save the life of the woman he loved deeply, Frank was driven to desperation and came up with the absurd idea of having Isabella seduce Joshua.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From then on, everything developed as they had planned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella successfully had a kidney transplant and survived, and Bertha, who was Isabella and Frank's daughter, was taken back to the Elvador Villa by Joshua.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank missed Bertha terribly. To be with Bertha all the time, he resolutely changed his surname to Steele.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella then brought Frank before Joshua, pretending that Frank was her younger brother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Isabella pretended to be worried and said, "I'm worried about Bertha.
