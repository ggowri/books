"This can't be right... they're still the Chairman and his wife from the Elvador Group," he stammered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, Daniel shot him an icy glare that sent chills down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam quickly shut his mouth, realizing he had said the wrong thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew Julian was ruthless, but Sam hadn't expected even a mere driver to carry such a deadly aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just moments ago, when Daniel gently adjusted Aurora's dress, Sam thought he seemed approachable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How wrong he had been about the driver's cold-blooded nature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam silently cursed himself for letting Joshua and Celeste in so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the Elvador Group had its standing, it was nowhere near the league of the Hawke Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Hawke Group's influence was undeniable. Even powerful families like the Elvador family sought their favor, so how dare a lowly security guard like him risk offending them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he couldn't take all the blame. Joshua had tempted him with a hundred thousand dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The money was his first reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His second reason was that with so many guests today, he figured the Hawke family wouldn't notice the Elvador couple sneaking in without an invitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, it seemed like his plan had backfired entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam did not doubt that Daniel could make him disappear from the face of the earth if he didn't follow orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After weighing his options, Sam waved to his men, signaling them to drag Joshua and Celeste into the dark alley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within moments, blood-curdling screams echoed from inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel stood at the alley entrance, listening to the screams with cold indifference as if he had done this a thousand times before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lit a cigarette and smoked in silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The screams had stopped when he finished his cigarette.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam came out to find Daniel still standing there, motionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt relieved that he hadn't tried to disobey Daniel's orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly dropped the bloodied bat and approached Daniel, saying, "It's done exactly as you asked."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel nodded, dropped his cigarette butt, and crushed it under his foot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then patted Sam's shoulder and said, "Good job. I'll let it slide that you let people into the party without invitations."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam laughed nervously and said, "I'll be more careful from now on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel remained silent, staring at Sam with eyes that seemed to pierce right through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After an eternity, he finally spoke, "You know the Hawke family doesn't like leaving loose ends."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam's heart skipped a beat as he stammered, "I understand. I'll delete all the security footage in the area and clean up the blood in the alley immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel was quite pleased with Sam's quick understanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded and said, "Get to it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam nodded repeatedly, relieved to be dismissed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, there was a commotion from the alley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The security guards dragged out Joshua and Celeste, whose legs had been broken, leaving a long trail of blood behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel smiled as he looked at the bloody streaks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This settles the score for what they did to future Mrs. Hawke's legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it is only the beginning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A luxurious passenger van slowly pulled into Orley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two women sat inside the vehicle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One wore a red evening gown with cascading hair waves and bright red lipstick. Thanks to excellent self-care, she looked barely in her thirties despite her age. Her curvaceous figure and stunning beauty screamed wealthy socialite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next to her sat a woman in white, her hair elegantly pinned up to reveal a graceful neck. She radiated an aura of pure elegance, like a pristine jasmine flower in bloom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This woman was none other than Bertha, who had just returned from Putnam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha had tirelessly gathered information about Julian during her month-long stay in Putnam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, she didn't believe the rumors that Julian's intimate problems were the cause of his twisted personality and ruthlessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her surprise, Julian was a man of integrity with extraordinary talents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rumors were completely false.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These malicious stories stemmed from Julian's childhood friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This friend had been obsessively in love with Julian, treating him like personal property and trying to keep all other women away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Julian's exceptional qualities continued to attract women despite her threats and manipulation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To discourage these pursuers once and for all, she had spread vicious rumors portraying Julian as some deviant who couldn't perform in bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The plan worked perfectly. The women of Putnam began looking at Julian with discomfort and suspicion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the heir to the Hawke family, Julian could have easily squashed these rumors with his power and influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he let them spread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even encouraged them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, since the rumors began circulating, those troublesome women had finally stopped chasing after him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Julian could accept a breakup, he wouldn't tolerate being slandered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At just twenty-two, he ruthlessly bankrupted his friend's family despite their years of partnership and coldly shipped her off to Soladia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once-privileged heiress of the Putnam family was reduced to living on pickled vegetables. Within a year, she reportedly lost over sixty pounds and fell into depression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Six years had passed, and no one cared about her fate anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Life couldn't have gotten much better for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that was just the price for spreading rumors about Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man known as "The Grim Reaper of Wall Street" truly lived up to his reputation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His ruthless methods had made everyone keep their distance since that incident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha leaned back in her plush chair, a confident smile on her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of being scared off by Julian's brutality, she was even more intrigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her eyes, that girl had been a complete fool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She got what she deserved, being sent to Soladia to live on scraps because she didn't understand what men really wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Men need their pride and dignity. They prefer women who depend on them, not crazy stalkers who spread rumors about their masculinity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A powerful man like Julian needed to be conquered by a gentlewoman like herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never failed to get any man she set her sights on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It worked with Hubery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It worked with Adolph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Julian would be no exception.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha turned to look at the stunning woman beside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This elegant lady was Julian's mother, Judy Barlowe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha realized that winning Julian's heart didn't necessarily mean focusing on him directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An indirect approach, like winning his mother's approval first, could work just as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Getting Judy on her side would bring her closer to capturing Julian's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha flashed an innocent, pristine smile and said, "Hey, Judy, we were having such a great time in Putnam. What made you come to Orley?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was right!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had deliberately called her "Judy" instead of "Mrs. Hawke"!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the beginning, Bertha planned to become best friends with Julian's mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, no woman could resist being complimented on her youth and beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she first saw Judy, she gushed with amazement. "Girl, what's your beauty secret? Your skin is like porcelain, just like a baby's! And your figure is killer! You've got to tell me how you do it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was quite the ego boost for a woman pushing fifty to be called pretty by someone in her early twenties, especially with such enthusiastic compliments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy was thrilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, as the wife of a wealthy family, she was used to receiving flattery from those around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Bertha was from Orley, her accent made it clear she wasn't a Putnam local. Judy instinctively felt these compliments weren't just empty flattery from someone who knew her status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of Bertha's most extraordinary talents was playing the innocent ingenue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Bertha gazed at her with those pure, guileless eyes, Judy couldn't help but believe her praise was genuine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It instantly created a bond between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being well aware, Bertha's cleverness showed how she pretended not to know Judy was from the Hawke family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She even acted completely clueless about Beatrice's birthday celebration today, pretending her friend had brought her to Orley for fun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bubbled excitedly, "Since we're in Orley, you must visit my place! My mom would be overjoyed to meet such a gorgeous friend!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beautiful woman replied, "Today is my husband's mother's eightieth birthday celebration. That's actually why I'm in Orley. But I could visit after the party."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bertha's jaw dropped in disbelief. "Wait, what? You're married? And here I was planning to set you up with my brother!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="92.html">« Prev</a><a href="94.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
