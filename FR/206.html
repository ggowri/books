Her gentle eyes now felt like sharp knives, piercing deep into his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It hurt so much!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood erupted from his mouth, splattering agai</span><span>nst Aurora's gravestone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's brow furrowed, a flicker of annoyance flashing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a shred of mercy, Aria pushed the pain-wracked Barnett aside. "Get away! You're dirtying my mom's grave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reaching into her pocket, she took out a handkerchief and began to wipe the blood off the gravestone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though small, her gaze held an almost reverent intensity as she treated the stone as though it were the most precious treasure in the world, refusing to allow even the slightest desecration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett looked up in agony, his eyes bloodshot and filled with despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you tell the kids everything about Aurora?" he hissed through gritted teeth, directing his anger at Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian looked down at him, unwavering. "I did."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fury ignited in Barnett's eyes. "Why would you tell her? She's just a kid; how could she bear it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smile crept across Julian's face. "How I raise my daughter isn't your business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My daughter can be innocent and kindhearted, but she must also understand the world's wickedness. We give her all our love, but she's no delicate flower sheltered from the storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora was picked on because of her kindness. My daughter will need to learn to fight back against people like you, not just tolerate them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Aria had finished cleaning the gravestone, she turned to Barnett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her tender age, the cold, steely look on her face sent shivers down the spine. She resembled Aurora to a tee, yet there was a fiery intensity about her that was a dead ringer for Julian's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I should give it to my dad for how he brought me up. I can be as kind as the nicest soul around, but I can also be tougher than the meanest thug. People like you don't deserve an ounce of mercy from me," she said matter-of-factly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett gazed at Aria, disbelief etched on his face as if he couldn't comprehend that such words were coming from a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body began to tremble uncontrollably. "I know I was wrong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria let out a scoff, her face bearing an air of maturity well beyond her years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're waking up way too late. What I need is my mom, not a good-for-nothing uncle like you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you really feel bad about what happened to my mom, then do me a favor and never set foot here again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett felt like he'd been hit by a bolt of lightning. Aria's words were like hammer blows, pounding on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He yearned to lay his hand on the cold gravestone, but as he lifted his arm, Aria swatted it away firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you dare touch my mom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett whined, "Is there any way I can make up for it? Even if it means guarding her grave for the rest of my life?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Aria frowned and waved him off with a flick of her wrist. She said, "We don't want you around. Your presence would just mess up my mom's journey in the afterlife. Leave and don't ever show your face again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett crumpled to the ground in defeat. "No way! I'm not leaving. I want to stay here with Aurora. I have to make up for my wrongs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria turned to Julian. "Dad, get someone to chuck him out of here. He's making too much racket; he'll bug Mom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian let out a soft laugh. "Yeah, he's being too noisy. Aurora always liked things quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Somebody, get him out of here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his order, a few bodyguards in sharp black suits and sunglasses showed up. They roughly grabbed Barnett and started to haul him away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not going! I'm not going!" Barnett flailed around wildly, his eyes glued desperately to Aurora's gravestone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how hard he put up a fight, he still got dragged off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His anguished shouts lingered in the cemetery long after he was gone, tugging at everyone's heartstrings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian checked his watch and then looked at Aria. "Time to go, Aria."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure thing." She nodded and then gazed at the photo of Aurora on the gravestone. "Mom, Dad and I'll come see you again when we can."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett staggered down the road in a daze, his mind swirling with confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked unsteadily, his eyes blank, as the vivid image of Aurora's black-and-white photo on the gravestone kept replaying in his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way. I can't buy it. Aurora's still alive. You're all pulling my leg..." he muttered to himself, drowning in despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wandered aimlessly, the world around him turning into a hazy blur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of a sudden, a girl in a white dress caught his eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face, even from afar, reminded him so strongly of Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's heart skipped a beat, and his eyes popped wide open. "Aurora? Aurora!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took off running towards her, driven by sheer desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could get to her, she hopped into a shiny black Bentley that roared to life and sped off, leaving him choking in a cloud of dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a frenzy, he chased after the car, tears streaming down his face. "Aurora, don't go! Please, just give me one more look! I was an idiot, I swear I'll never treat you like that again! I'll keep you safe, love you to bits, and give you the world! Just don't leave me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how hard he hollered, the car didn't slow down an inch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It just zoomed off, and passers-by turned to gawk at him like he'd lost his marbles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Barnett didn't give a damn about their looks; his whole world had shrunk to that disappearing Bentley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he tripped and went sprawling on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His palms scraped against the asphalt and a sharp pain shot through his knee, but he hardly felt it. Instead, Barnett reached out in the direction the car had vanished, as if he could grab hold of the fading hope it symbolized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sat there for what seemed like ages, watching a stream of strangers come and go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Barnett dragged himself to his feet, exhausted and beaten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time Barnett got home, night had well and truly fallen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He staggered up to his front door on wobbly legs, only to spot a familiar black Bentley parked outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaning against the car was a guy in a black suit. When he saw Barnett, he said casually, "You're finally back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten years had changed both of them, but Barnett recognized him right away&mdash;Adolph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Considering Adolph's past with Aurora, he should be paying for his deeds. But Julian only brought the Sherwood family down without going after Adolph and his parents further, probably out of deference to Camille.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph still had that poker-faced look, with a touch of regret etched on his features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett gave him the cold eye. "What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph motioned towards the house. "I want to buy your villa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the Sherwood family had taken a nosedive, Adolph was still a shrewd businessman. Over the past ten years, he'd managed to rebuild the family's wealth. It wasn't back to its former splendor, but he was now sitting on tens of millions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the Sherwood family started to make a comeback, he'd planned to buy the Elvador Villa. But with Barnett behind bars, he had no choice but to wait till Barnett got out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph couldn't get Aurora out of his head. He yearned to start afresh in the place where she once lived for three years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even hoped to find some lingering traces of her within those walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett let out a scornful snort. "You really think I'd sell the place where Aurora lived to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A brief flicker of pain crossed Adolph's eyes. "Barnett, for the past ten years, I've thought about her day in and day out. I wanna start over in the place that used to be her home. I just want to feel closer to her memory."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett didn't miss a beat. "No way in hell. I'm not selling."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he brushed past Adolph and made his way towards the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph quickly reached out and grabbed his arm. "How much do you need? Just tell me a price."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett angrily shook him off. "I don't want your money! I'm not selling. Just get lost."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, Barnett knew that he, too, wished he could get closer to Aurora, even if it was just through the fragments of their shared past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett could barely imagine what life would be like if he sold the house. It was his last link to Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That storage room where she had lived for three years, which he used to look down on, now felt like a holy place he wanted to stay in every day. He was desperate to figure out what she had gone through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed the only way he could make up for things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph said, stepping in his way, "Barnett, you've got a criminal record. It'll be a real hassle finding a job. How are you gonna support yourself?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, I can pay you. Take the money and you can live like a king for the rest of your life. I just want the house."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph begged, but Barnett wasn't budging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Beat it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Barnett pushed Adolph aside, as firm as a rock. "I'd rather kick the bucket in this house than sell it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph staggered back from the shove, almost losing his footing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the car door flew open and a girl in a white dress stepped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, she landed a hard slap on Barnett's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell do you think you are, laying a hand on Adolph?" Jane West snapped, her chin held high and fury in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett was seething after getting slapped. His anger flared up like wildfire, but the moment he focused on Jane's face, it fizzled out in a heartbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora? Is it really you? You finally decided to see me! I knew you are okay!" He lunged forward, wrapping her up in a bear hug. Tears streamed down his face, a crazy mix of joy and madness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane wriggled and squirmed in his grasp. "Let go of me, you nutjob! Who the hell are you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adolph, help me out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph snapped out of his daze and yanked Barnett away. Then he landed a solid punch on Barnett's face. "Get your act together!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The punch sent Barnett staggering back. A thin trickle of blood ran down from his lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned slowly, his face blank but his eyes smoldering with pent-up rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett charged at Adolph, fists flying. He landed a good one on Adolph's jaw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph wiped the blood off his face, his eyes blazing with anger as he struck back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two men were in a no-holds-barred fight, trading punches like there was no tomorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! Please, just cut it out!" Jane shouted, her voice tinged with desperation as she watched the mayhem unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her pleas went in one ear and out the other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp clatter of high heels drew near, and a woman in a red dress stood close by, eyeing the scene with a sneering smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Camille. Her eyes glinted with mockery as she shook her head disdainfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at you two, it's so pitiful fighting over a cheap imitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you'd treated Aurora half as well as you're pretending to now, she might still be alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that she's gone, you're both full of regret and trying to make up for it. It's all just a show, ain't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Aurora's death, her brother had been on the hunt for women who resembled her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the past decade, he'd tracked down more than a dozen, each one sharing something with her&mdash;be it their back view, profile, or personality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These women all became the comfort to his soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This latest one was the closest match he'd found yet; her build and features were almost identical to Aurora's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a bit more work, he could make her an exact copy of the woman he'd lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camille knew her brother inside out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was trying to fill the void left by Aurora by finding a look-alike and having her live in the place where Aurora used to be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a sad, desperate attempt to convince himself that she'd never really left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kind of behavior made her sick to her stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">People never know what they've got till it's gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Now that Aurora's gone, they're acting like their world's falling apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">They dug their own graves; they've got what they deserve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If Aurora's spirit is still around, she won't be touched by their acts. She'd think it's a total joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camille watched the scene for a bit and then decided it wasn't worth her time anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to leave.</span><br><span>Aurora, if there's a next life, I hope you find happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Never come back to a messed-up family like the Elvador family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Camille's sincere wish for her dear friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out in front of the villa, the two guys finally stopped fighting, both beaten up and bruised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett, though, wasn't paying attention to his own injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his eyes fixed on Jane and his face swollen, he managed a smile. "Aurora, is that you? You've come back? Have you forgiven me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane gave him a dirty look. "What the hell? I'm not Aurora! You've got the wrong chick."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her sassy attitude was totally understandable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since she stepped into Adolph's world, she got everything she'd ever dreamed of. Going from being a bar girl to living in a fancy mansion was like a wild dream come true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph had spoiled her rotten for over two years. The only thing that bugged her was his hesitation to take their relationship to the next level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also told her to keep her mouth shut and not to go out whenever she pleased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, Jane finally got taken out to look at houses, only to run into a nutjob who gave her an outlet for her pent-up frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she never thought her off-hand remarks would set Barnett off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a fit of rage, Barnett lashed out and slapped her hard across the face. "Chick? Don't you dare bad-mouth my sister!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph's eyes turned blood-red with anger as he clapped his hand over her mouth. "Didn't I tell you to zip it? You don't sound anything like her. You're just a classless bimbo!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Adolph's hand cutting off her air, Jane started to struggle, gasping for breath as dizziness washed over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as her vision started to go blurry, Barnett finally came to his senses. "Let go of her! She's going to choke to death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph quickly let her go and pulled her into his arms, whispering, "Sorry, Aurora. I didn't mean it. Please forgive me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett stared at Jane, completely taken by how much she resembled Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From some angles, the resemblance was just uncanny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adolph, you thinking of moving her into my place?" he asked, his voice laced with curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly. How much do you want for it?" Adolph pushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's eyes sparkled as he kept looking at Jane. "I'm not selling the house, but if you two want to live there, I won't stand in your way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From that day on, the three of them moved into the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep your mouth shut. You don't look like Aurora when you talk."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who said you could smile? You look nothing like her when you do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sit tight. When the sunlight hits you right, you look even more like Aurora."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who let you into the storage room? Get out of there! Don't lay a finger on anything that belongs to Aurora."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their twisted obsession, Barnett and Adolph began to transform Jane to resemble Aurora even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they could all be together forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their world, Aurora had never truly left; she had always been there, lingering in the shadows.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="205.html">« Prev</a><a href="207.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
