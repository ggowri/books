It was all her fault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her experiences had subtly shaped Lily, turning her into a harbinger of misfortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had gotten Daisy fired from the </span><span>Elvador</span><span> family, driven Lily to kill, and was responsible for Julian's legs being crushed by falling rocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If these people had never crossed paths with her, their lives would have been so much brighter and more promising.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, she was determined to do something meaningful before she died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the doctor finished explaining her condition, he left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel, Darren, and Samuel all turned to look at her, their eyes filled with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora offered them a weak smile. "Don't worry. I'm fine," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she looked at Daniel. "Daniel," she said, "don't tell Julian about everything that's happened recently. I don't want him to worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel </span><span>hesitated</span><span> but </span><span>finally</span><span> nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Aurora saw him agree, her smile deepened. She turned</span><span> </span><span>to Darren. "Darren, you're a doctor. Could you prescribe me some pain medication? I... I'm afraid of the pain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren paused for a moment. A flicker of compassion crossed his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew everything Aurora had been through, and because of that, he understood her character even more deeply. She rarely complained about pain, and this was the first time she'd ever done so. It was clear she was in unbearable pain, but too proud to ask for medication.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was a bit hoarse. "Alright, I'll grab you some pain meds right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora nodded. After Darren left, she turned to Daniel and Samuel and said, "I'm tired. I'd like to rest for a bit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was pale as a sheet, and she was so exhausted that her eyes could barely stay open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel and Samuel, seeing her condition, urged her to rest and left with Darren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>ward</span><span> was now empty, with only Aurora remaining.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She</span><span> </span><span>looked out the window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weather was lovely today, with sunlight streaming through the window and falling perfectly onto her bedside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stretched out her hand toward the window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warm sunlight fell on her arm. Despite its warmth, it couldn't dispel the coldness inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sunlight was so beautiful, the world so wonderful, and she had so many people who cared about her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, she would no longer be able to experience this beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She really didn</span><span>'</span><span>t want to let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, Darren returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, take </span><span>this</span><span> and you'll feel better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora </span><span>smiled </span><span>and obediently swallowed the painkiller.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren didn't linger long. After checking on her briefly and telling her to rest, he left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was alone once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the pain medication started to take effect and dull most of her pain, she mustered her strength and got out of bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She limped out with unsteady steps and went to Julian's door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the glass panel, she could see Julian lying on the hospital bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His legs were encased in plaster casts, and he lay utterly still.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike his usual confident self, Julian looked beaten and vulnerable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel was in the room, seemingly engaged in conversation with Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Aurora saw Julian in such a state, her tears began to fall uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Julian had never met her, he wouldn't be in this </span><span>mess</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wiped her tears away, staring at Julian intently as if trying to permanently etch his image into her soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long moment, she reluctantly turned away, limping </span><span>back</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Julian, I'm so sorry. I can't even say goodbye to you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I know you'd never let me leave if I tried, so I'll just slip away quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving the hospital, Aurora found a pesticide store and walked in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Pest killer</span><span>," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The store clerk gave her a once-over, taking in her appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was wearing a hospital gown, noticeably thin, and limping slightly with each step. Her face was pale as a sheet, and her eyes were vacant. She looked like she was barely hanging on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Red flags shot up in the clerk's head right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked extremely sick, definitely not some farmer needing pest killer. </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Was she trying to off herself?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That thought creeped him out. "Look," he said, straight up, "we can't sell you that stuff."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why not?" Aurora pressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clerk's smile got weird. "Can't take chances," he dodged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stood there, feeling lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her current appearance, anyone would assume she might be planning to commit suicide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dejected, she left the store.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catching her reflection in the storefront's glass window, she paused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took in her haggard, ghostly appearance, a deep sorrow welling inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body was straight-up wrecked. How the hell had she let herself go this bad?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pulled in a deep breath and forced herself to look away from that trainwreck in the glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she walked into a clothing store and bought a new outfit. Carefully, she bundled herself up, adding a mask and sunglasses to completely disguise her appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she returned to the pesticide store this time, the clerk didn't recognize her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She got the pest killer with surprising ease, slipping the bottle into her pocket before catching a taxi to the police station.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car stopped in front of the police station.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora </span><span>looked up</span><span>, taking in the imposing building before her. The white walls gleamed brilliantly in the sunlight, and the police emblem perched high on the rooftop radiated an almost tangible sense of authority and justice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A whirlwind of emotions surged through her&mdash;fear mixed with an unwavering resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew the path she was about to take was a one-way street, but it was the only way to help Lily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With heavy steps, Aurora pushed through the station's entrance. The lobby was eerily quiet, with just one on-duty officer sitting at the front desk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to turn myself in," she declared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words immediately caught the officer's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Turn yourself in? What crime are you confessing to?" the officer asked, his voice sharp with suspicion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora slowly took off her sunglasses and mask, revealing her exhausted face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I killed someone," she stated flatly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officer's eyes widened. In all his years on the force, he'd never come face-to-face with such a serious confession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly stood up, his eyes filled with caution and gravity. Skipping the formalities, he swiftly secured handcuffs around Aurora's wrists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's body involuntarily trembled as the cold metal clinked against her skin. This sensation was all too familiar; it had been her daily reality for five years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five years ago, she was forced to take the blame for Bertha. Now, five years later, she was willingly taking the fall for Lily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora closed her eyes, struck by the bitter irony of her life's path.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="191.html">« Prev</a><a href="193.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
