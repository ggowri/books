His legs nearly gave out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery, too, was overwhelmed with shock and guilt. As a lawyer, he had sworn to uphold truth and justice, yet when it came to Bertha, he had been blind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had insisted on Aurora's guilt, convinced that the innocent and kind-hearted Bertha could never commit such a crime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Elvador family backing Bertha's claims, he had simply accepted it as fact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, reality shattered his convictions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold sweat broke out on his forehead, his eyes darting nervously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora watched them both, taking in their reactions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had once believed that proving her innocence would bring her satisfaction, but there was no joy in this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only a bitter emptiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if she was finally cleared, those five years of suffering could never be erased. The betrayal, the humiliation, the pain&mdash;those wounds would never heal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She despised them. She resented them. And she would make sure they suffered alongside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she had to live with this agony, so would they.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking directly at Camille, Aurora spoke again, her voice steady and commanding, "Camille, tell them. Was it Bertha who pushed you down the stairs five years ago?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett, Hubery, and Adolph all froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, they didn't want to know the answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because if Camille confirmed it, then everything they had believed in, everything they had done, would collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They would have to face the horrifying truth&mdash;that they had condemned the wrong person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett abruptly interrupted, his voice forced and tense, "Aurora, Camille just woke up. She's still weak. Let her rest. I'll take you home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached out to pull Aurora away, but she dodged him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery, trying to play mediator, forced a smile, though it was visibly strained. "Aurora, Barnett's right. We're overwhelming Camille. Let's give her time to recover. We can talk about this later, alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's expression turned ice-cold. "Are you scared? Scared of the truth? Scared to find out that the person you thought was innocent is actually a heartless snake? Scared to admit that you were played like fools?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neither man responded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their silence was their answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They no longer had the courage to argue with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their gazes, once condescending, were now pleading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora let out a sharp laugh and then turned to Adolph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her piercing stare cut through him like a blade, and even without words, he knew exactly what she was saying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adolph, are you not curious to know the real culprit?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face turned pale, and his internal conflict played out in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>H</span><span>e feared hearing a truth he wasn't prepared to accept. If Bertha was guilty, then his hatred, his revenge, his five years of cruelty toward Aurora&mdash;all of it would be unforgivable. </span><span>Yet</span><span>, as Camille's brother, he owed her justice. He needed to know the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The war within him paralyzed him, leaving him unable to decide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora found it utterly laughable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For years, he had sworn that no amount of punishment could ever make up for what she had supposedly done to Camille.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had made himself out to be the devoted brother willing to do anything for his sister. But now? When the truth was within reach, he hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All because he wanted to protect Bertha. Even if it meant leaving Camille in the dark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adolph, you're a joke."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora took a step back, standing firmly beside Camille, making it clear whose side she was on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Camille," she said, her voice unwavering. "Tell them. Was Bertha the one who pushed you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, it was time for justice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camille closed her eyes, her expression one of silent determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha, on the other hand, was trembling violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett, Hubery, and Adolph looked utterly terrified, as though they wanted to flee before they heard the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora drank in their fear. It was intoxicating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Camille was about to open her eyes and confirm it, a sharp voice cut through the tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you all doing here? Do you have any idea how much noise you're making? A hospital is no place for this kind of chaos!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A woman in a white coat, Isabella Steele, entered the room, followed closely by Joshua and Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha's eyes lit up the moment she saw Isabella. It was as if she had just been handed a lifeline. But she knew better than to show it. Instead, she forced herself to maintain a pitiful expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Isabella's gaze landed on Bertha, it was filled with warmth and concern. Yet the moment she looked at Aurora and the others, her entire demeanor changed. Her voice turned cold and commanding. "You're disturbing the patient. If you care about her recovery, you'll leave. Now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor Adolph had brought earlier was clearly surprised. "Dr. Steele, what brings you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I hadn't come, this hospital would have been torn apart," Isabella snapped. "Enough. Everyone out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella tucked her hands into her pockets, standing tall with a defiant, no-nonsense attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora remained motionless, her sharp gaze shifting to Barnett, Hubery, and Adolph. To her disgust, she noticed the three men simultaneously let out a breath of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett quickly latched onto the excuse. "You're right, Dr. Steele. We were inconsiderate. Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed Bertha, ready to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's voice rang out like a whip. "No one is leaving until the truth is revealed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett halted, irritation flashing in his eyes. He turned back to her, exasperated. "Aurora, enough! If you want to talk, do it at home. Stop making a scene."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora let out a scornful laugh. "We're seconds away from exposing the real culprit, and you want to leave? What a convenient excuse. I'm telling you now&mdash;no one is walking out of this room until Camille finishes what she started."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You&mdash;" Barnett was trembling with rage. Bertha, still tucked in his arms, looked like the perfect picture of a wronged victim, her eyes glistening with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, I've always seen you as my real sister," she whispered, voice breaking. "Why do you hate me so much? If I've done something wrong, tell me, and I'll change. I just want us to get along."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!" Aurora snapped, lifting her hand, ready to slap her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could, Isabella grabbed her wrist in an iron grip, twisting it back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is a hospital, not a courtroom. If you want justice, take it to the proper authorities. Stop interfering with patient care," Isabella said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes narrowed at Aurora, a subtle but unmistakable warning in her gaze, tinged with a touch of disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind her, Joshua and Celeste stood without speaking, but their disapproving looks made it clear&mdash;if Aurora pushed any further, they wouldn't hesitate to make things difficult for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora took a deep breath, trying to steady herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She studied Isabella, narrowing her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been so close&mdash;Camille was on the verge of publicly naming Bertha as the one responsible, but at that crucial moment, Isabella had shown up, throwing a wrench in everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words Isabella had just spoken felt as if they were meant for everyone, but the sharpness in her gaze made it clear they were intended for Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, when Aurora had attempted to confront Bertha, she had been stopped with such force that her wrist had almost been crushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora didn't believe in coincidences. Too many of them were simply too convenient, too carefully orchestrated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella was hiding something, that much was clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's voice was steady but filled with suspicion as she asked, "What's your relationship with Bertha? Why is it that the moment you enter, all you seem to do is defend her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, Isabella's composed mask faltered. But she quickly regained her composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't make baseless accusations. I am simply fulfilling my duty as the hospital director and ensuring order is maintained."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="63.html">« Prev</a><a href="65.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
