Isabella said, her eyes blazing with fury. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My son has never harmed you. He is innocent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora spoke coldly, "All his food, clothes, and fancy life abroad&mdash;where do you think the money came from? It's all from the Elvador family. Since he's been happy to enjoy the perks you gave him, he should also bear the sins you've committed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A father's debt falls on the son," she continued, her tone steady but heavy, each word slamming into Isabella's heart like a hammer. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I only want one of his kidneys. That's not too much to ask."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, you can't do this! If you want revenge, take it out on us. My son doesn't know anything!" Isabella sobbed, tears streaming down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Isabella was truly terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She deeply loved Frank. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without him, she wouldn't be where she was today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To keep her alive, her husband had to stomach her seducing Joshua, even sharing her with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank's love was grand, boundless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't let his line die out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">My son can't be harmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this thought, Isabella steeled herself. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Bertha with eyes full of helplessness and sorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bertha, don't blame me. I have no choice," she whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha couldn't believe her mother was willing to abandon her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood there, stunned, watching as Isabella begged Aurora, "Aurora, I agree. As long as... Bertha dies, I'll sign the donation agreement immediately. Just please, don't touch my son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as you spare him, you can do whatever you want with us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, you can't do this to me! I'm your daughter too!" Bertha screamed, her voice breaking. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you agree to Aurora's deal, isn't that just handing her my life?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha sobbed uncontrollably, her heart shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her twenty-three years, she had never felt pain this deep, this unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She finally tasted what it was like to be discarded by her parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like her heart had been ripped out, bleeding with every beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wailed, thrashing in agony, her cries so pitiful they could soften any heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no one in the room felt sorry for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all knew this was a mirror of what Aurora had endured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua and Celeste had hurt Aurora countless times for Bertha's sake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the tables had turned, and everything was reversed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Aurora who once suffered in silence had become an observer of this farce, while the pampered Bertha had been reduced to a pitiful victim, wounded by her own parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the revenge Aurora had dreamed of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The innocent, kind-hearted girl who had once longed for her family's love and humbled herself to the dust for a scrap of affection, had died in prison long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The day she walked free, she had wanted nothing more than to cut ties with the Elvador family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, she had no desire for revenge, nor the ability to seek it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the Elvadors wouldn't let her go, pushing her step by step to this breaking point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart had shattered under their endless betrayals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Julian, Beatrice, Ashley, and Daisy who had pieced her shattered heart back together with their love and warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They kept her from turning into a monster, from dragging those who hurt her down with her into the abyss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of them, she clung to a shred of goodness, a fragile hope for something beautiful in this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although that hope flickered like a candle in the wind, ready to go out at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Julian took a document prepared long ago and tossed it onto the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here is the agreement. Sign it, and both of you can walk away," he said, his voice deep and magnetic, directed at Isabella and Frank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them looked skeptical, hardly believing that Julian would actually let them go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when they saw the contents of the document, their hearts sank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It demanded that they transfer all their wealth to Aurora with no strings attached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without money, how would they survive?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What about their son abroad?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, at this point, they had no choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's influence was vast and untouchable. They couldn't afford to cross him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they didn't do as he said, not only would they suffer, but their son would be dragged into it too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella suppressed the excruciating pain in her heart. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a trembling hand, she picked up the pen and signed her name on the document, transferring all the wealth Joshua had given her to Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a twist of fate, the wealth that was never truly hers circled back to its rightful owner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian picked up the document and handed it to Aurora with a solemn expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her, that thin paper felt like it weighed a thousand pounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked up, meeting his warm, tender gaze, and a mix of bitterness and gratitude surged within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So, from the start, Mr. Hawke has planned to reclaim everything that was mine. He even prepared the papers ahead of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawke, thank you. You've been so good to me, and I don't know how to repay you," Aurora said, her voice trembling with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled faintly, "You really want to repay me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nodded firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another debt to Julian piled onto her guilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had saved her from jumping off a bridge, watched her drink a million-dollar bottle of wine, and covered her medical bills time and again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't repaid any of it, and now this massive favor left her ashamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whatever you ask, I'll do my best," she promised sincerely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's eyes glinted with a deeper amusement, his gaze like a hunter eyeing prey caught in a trap he had set.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then take </span><span>this</span><span> as your dowry and bring it to the Hawke family," his voice was slow and steady, but it landed like a stone thrown into a calm lake, stirring up ripples of emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's face flushed red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last time, when he proposed in Italian, she didn</span><span>'</span><span>t understand, </span><span>yet </span><span>she somehow agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he had spoken every word clearly and deliberately, and she heard it perfectly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overwhelmed by such an enormous surprise, Aurora should have been overjoyed, but for some reason, tears welled up uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart ached with a bitter sting. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cursed fate for bringing her the right person at the wrong time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She adored Julian and Beatrice, and becoming part of their family was a dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with her broken, frail body, she didn't deserve him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He's so young. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Someone like me doesn't belong at his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears flowed harder as she grieved her inability to seize this happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian quickly pulled out a tissue, wiping her tears and coaxing softly, "Don't cry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want to, but the sadness overwhelmed her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even getting back at Bertha didn't lift her spirits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once I finish embroidering The Garden, I'll leave for abroad with Lily. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'll never see Mr. Hawke or Madam Hawke again.</span><br><span>At that thought, the pain stabbed deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to hold back any longer, Aurora threw herself into Julian's arms and burst into loud sobs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her sudden action caught him off guard, and his body stiffened for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief pause, he reached out and patted her back gently. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he knew she couldn't hear, he still murmured, "It's okay, it's okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph watched, the scene burning into his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't believe Julian would propose so casually at such a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Aurora would collapse into his arms, crying tears of joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jealousy devoured his reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to take it anymore, Adolph shouted, "Julian, let go of Aurora! She's still engaged to me. I'm her fianc&eacute;!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="150.html">« Prev</a><a href="152.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
