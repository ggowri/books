She sat calmly in the car, as steady as a rock.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The kidnapper was taken aback by her calm demeanor. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you scared?" he asked, his voice laced with confusion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shouldn't it be you guys who are scared?" Aurora retorted coolly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh, we're bold enough to kidnap you</span><span>. W</span><span>hat's there to be afraid of?" the kidnapper sneered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I'm not mistaken, someone must have put you up to this, right? Tsk, tsk, tsk. The person who ordered you to kidnap me must really hate you guys." Aurora said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora raised an eyebrow. "Looks like you don't even know who I am."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell you are doesn't matter to us. We're just doing a job for money. </span><span>As long as</span><span> you behave, we won't kill you. But you'll have to keep us boys entertained."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure about that?" Aurora glanced at the kidnapper sitting beside her. "I'm the heiress of the Barron Group. If you let me go right now and tell me who hired you, I might let you off the hook. Otherwise, you're </span><span>gonna</span><span> be in some serious trouble."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver slammed on the brakes and stared at Aurora in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're the heiress of the Barron Group? The genius scientist?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora nodded. "That's right</span><span>. I</span><span>t's me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two kidnappers sized Aurora up from head to toe, their eyes widening in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kidnapping an ordinary person was one thing; they might have a shot at getting away with it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But kidnapping a scientist? That was a whole different </span><span>situation</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long ago, this scientist had been kidnapped in Orley. Every single one of the kidnappers had ended up in jail.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she hadn't been harmed, the mastermind behind the kidnapping had been sentenced to death.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two kidnappers started to tremble with fear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're lying. We don't believe you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't believe me, go ahead and use my phone to call my parents and brother to ask for a ransom."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The kidnapper sitting next to Aurora quickly rummaged through her belongings, found her phone, unlocked it, and dialed William's number.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The phone rang only once before it was answered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William's voice came through the speaker. "Aurora, already missing me? I told you to stay at the company a little longer, but you just wouldn't listen. If you miss me, </span><span>come</span><span> back. I'll be here for you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more the kidnappers listened, the more nervous they got. They swallowed hard, their Adam's apples bobbing up and down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were just doing a job for money, but they weren't stupid.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how brave they were, they didn't have the guts to kidnap this scientist. It was a serious crime.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the kidnappers covered the phone's speaker and whispered to Aurora, "We'll let you go, but you can't call the cops on us."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora nodded. "Okay."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The kidnapper removed his hand from the speaker. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora smiled gently and said, "Keep up the good work. I just accidentally hit your number. I'll hang up now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she ended the call.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The kidnappers let out a sigh of relief. They were seething with anger towards Rebecca.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Damn bitch. She's trying to get us killed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them looked at each other, still hesitant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really won't call the cops on us if we let you go?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora remained as calm as ever. "I'll give you a piece of advice. Turn yourselves in and tell the police who hired you. It'll help reduce your sentence."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two kidnappers looked at each other, clearly reluctant to turn themselves in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they did, they'd probably end up in jail.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora could see their indecision. "I'm giving you a chance. If you don't take it, you're </span><span>gonna</span><span> regret it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You? You think you can make us suffer?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora said, "I'm just a weak woman, but </span><span>I have helpers.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Aurora finished speaking, the next moment, a sleek black Rolls-Royce screeched to a halt right in front of their car.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver's door of the Rolls-Royce swung open, and out stepped a tall, imposing man. His broad shoulders and muscular build exuded an air of strength and authority.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora recognized him immediately. He was Daniel, Julian's personal driver and a former special forces soldier.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, Daniel opened the back door, and Julian emerged from the car.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's gaze was cold and intense, and the look he gave the kidnappers was as if they were already dead men.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where do you think you're taking my fianc&eacute;e?" he demanded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The kidnappers, of course, knew who Julian was.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They nearly soiled their pants in fear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's fianc&eacute;e was the beloved princess of the Barron family and a genius scientist.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was common knowledge in </span><span>Peloland</span><span>, and the two kidnappers were no exception.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had initially doubted Aurora's words, but now, seeing Julian in person, they were certain they had made a huge mistake by kidnapping the wrong person.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora calmly said, "I told you to turn yourselves in."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing they were </span><span>doomed,</span><span> the two kidnappers didn't resist. They meekly handed Aurora over.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Aurora stepped out of the car, Julian pulled her tightly into his arms.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be scared," he murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora wrapped her arms around him in return. "With you here, I'm not afraid."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Aurora was kidnapped in Orley last time, Julian had had a custom-made watch with a built-in GPS tracking system for her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was how he'd managed to arrive just in time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian narrowed his eyes at the kidnappers. "Who sent you to kidnap my fianc&eacute;e?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, there was no point in hiding anything. The two kidnappers spilled the beans.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rebecca Hansen? Who's that?" </span><span>Aurora</span><span> was completely lost.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian was equally clueless. "Who is Rebecca?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two kidnappers stared at Julian and Aurora in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca was a huge celebrity, the current A-lister with a staggering 80 million followers on social media.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could these two not know her?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were anyone else, they'd think the person was just pretending.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Julian was a wealthy tycoon from a prominent family, and Aurora was a brilliant scientist. It kind of made sense that they were out of the loop on celebrity gossip.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rebecca is a top-notch celebrity. She's dating the CEO of the Barron Group. She thought Ms. Barron was trying to steal her boyfriend, so she hired us to mess with Ms. Barron and take compromising pictures of her..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora</span><span> was </span><span>dumbfounded</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian was also at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora took a deep breath. Earlier that day, she'd been happy to learn that her brother had a girlfriend.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But less than an hour later, his girlfriend, out of jealousy, had mistaken her for a rival and had her kidnapped.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora gritted her teeth. Since her rebirth, she'd sworn never to let anyone push her around again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca, without even getting the facts straight, had hired people to kidnap and ruin her. Even if it was a misunderstanding, Aurora wasn't going to let it slide.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She grabbed her phone and called William again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he also picked up right away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, I knew you couldn't go a minute without me. Where are you? I'll send my assistant to pick you up right away," William said in a teasing tone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora said in a pitiful voice, "William, I was kidnapped."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William exclaimed, "What? I'm warning you, whoever you are, don't you dare hurt my sister. If </span><span>you hurt her</span><span>, the Barron family will come down on you like a ton of bricks."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing William's worried words, Aurora felt a warm feeling in her heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"William, I'm okay. Juli saved me," she said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those words instantly put William at ease.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, where are you? I'll come and get you right now," William said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian replied, "No need. I'll bring </span><span>Aurora</span><span> </span><span>to</span><span> you. I have something to talk to you about, too."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half an hour later, they arrived at the CEO's office of the Barron Group.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Aurora and Julian walked in, not only were Benjamin and William there, but Rebecca was also present.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deal for Rebecca to be the brand ambassador for the holographic helmet had been finalized, and they were about to sign the contract when Aurora's call came in, saying she'd been kidnapped.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, the signing had been put on hold.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="239.html">« Prev</a><a href="241.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
