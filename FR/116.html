"I'll look into this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's suffering struck him deeply. Just hearing her story made him feel like his chest was being squeezed, as if an invisible hand was tightening around his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't fathom how any parents could be so cold-hearted. He had always known people could be cruel, but this was unimaginable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Joshua and Celeste were truly behind this, bankrupting their family would hardly be enough punishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was about to leave, Julian's voice cut through the room, low and commanding. "You go rest. Let Daniel handle this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan froze for a moment, instinctively turning his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian was still sitting on the leather sofa, leaning slightly forward, his hands clasped </span><span>tightly together. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a chill in his gaze, a steely determination that made the air in the room feel heavier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel Jenkins was a man of action, known for taking down a dangerous drug lord's stronghold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After his military service, Julian, with his sharp eye for talent, recruited him as his personal driver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the surface, he was quiet and reserved, but behind the scenes, his skills had proven invaluable in handling some of the most dangerous situations for Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan knew Julian's temperament well. If Julian was letting Daniel take over, then he was truly angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With him on the case, the Elvador family's secrets, no matter how deep they were buried, would all be dragged into the light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reluctantly, Ethan sank back into his seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora felt a suffocating weight pressing down on her chest. She glanced around at the people in the room, each face full of sympathy and concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was too much to bear. Her heart felt like it was being crushed, and each beat brought a sharp pang of pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ache inside her was overwhelming, like a tidal wave crashing over her, threatening to drown her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to break down, to let it all out, but she couldn't. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not in front of them. She didn't want to make them worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she forced herself to appear calm, to hide the turmoil inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seconds later, s</span><span>he </span><span>forced a small smile, though it barely reached her eyes. "I... I'm going to my room."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood, but dizziness immediately hit her, the world around her spinning. </span><span>T</span><span>eetering, her body </span><span>sway</span><span>ed</span><span> </span><span>as if she might collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian, Ethan, and Darren were all on their feet in an instant, reaching out to catch her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Beatrice, Ashley, and Daisy instinctively moved forward, their faces full of worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Aurora, with sheer determination, steadied herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked up and forced a faint smile. "Don't worry. I'm fine. I just got up too quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The smile was fragile, and her body still trembled, but she managed to push past the sofa and headed toward the stairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Elvador, breakfast is ready. Please eat something," Daisy said softly, concern clear in her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked at her, </span><span>her </span><span>lips barely moving as she shook her head. "I'm not hungry, Daisy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her steps were slow and heavy, like she was walking through thick fog. Every movement felt weighed down, as if the ground itself was trying to drag her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy watched her limp away, her heart breaking with each step Aurora took.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was unbearable to think of the years she had spent in that cold, unloving household, enduring so much pain. Daisy could hardly hold back her tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Elvador family's cruelty had no bounds. To think they were even after her kidneys was unimaginable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Aurora didn't go to her bedroom. Instead, she walked straight to the embroidery room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood by the window, the sunlight warming her pale face, but it did nothing to lift the cold emptiness inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, the flowers in the garden were in full bloom, fiery red, soft pink, and pure white. The air was thick with the scent of blossoms, a beautiful contrast to the heaviness she felt inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This room had been specially chosen by Julian for her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had said, "When you're tired, stand here. Look at the view. Breathe in the fresh air. It'll help clear your mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Usually, standing by this window would bring her some peace, the simple beauty of the flowers and the fresh air lightening her mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But today, nothing could chase away the storm brewing inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora slowly made her way to the embroidery frame, her eyes resting on the colorful threads. But to her, they seemed dull and lifeless, devoid of any vibrancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her fingers involuntarily grazed the fabric, trembling slightly as memories of the years she had spent in the Elvador family swirled in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cold stares, the cruel words, and now, the horrific realization that her own parents might have been plotting to steal her organ... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>E</span><span>ach </span><span>thought was like a blade cutting deeper into her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She picked up the needle, her fingers shaking as she forced herself to focus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tried to distract herself by continuing the "The Garden" embroidery, a piece she had just started.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as the needle pierced the fabric for the third time, a tear slipped from her eye and fell onto the silk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wiped at it quickly, but more tears followed, each one uncontrollable, soaking the fabric in a growing patch of dampness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, in her daze, the needle pricked her finger. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood welled up, a stark red against the pale silk, mixing with her tears. </span><span>Then a</span><span> twisted, painful flower </span><span>bloom</span><span>ed</span><span> </span><span>on the fabric, mirrored the chaos inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything she had been holding in, all the pain, all the frustration, all the heartache, finally broke through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She collapsed over the table, sobbing, as the years of suffering poured out of her in one agonizing release.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian had quietly approached and was now standing behind her, watching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart </span><span>sank</span><span> </span><span>at the sight of her shaking shoulders, but when he reached out as though to comfort her, his hand froze midair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel her pain acutely, yet words failed him, and all he could do was stand there, silently bearing witness to her torment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's sobs spilled out, desperate and broken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did I do to deserve this? Why does it have to be me?</span><span> </span><span>Why do they hurt me when they know how badly I want love... Am I really that worthless?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's hand, still clenched by his side, tightened further, his knuckles white with the effort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spoke softly, but his words were firm and unwavering. "You're not worthless.</span><span> </span><span>You're not the problem.</span><span> </span><span>We all care about you.</span><span> </span><span>It's them. Everything they did is on them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora didn't hear him. She was too lost in her grief, crying uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her sobs echoed through the room, a heart-wrenching sound that seemed to penetrate everyone's soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the door, Beatrice, Ashley, and Daisy were standing, helplessly watching </span><span>the scene </span><span>with tears in their eyes. Their hearts ached, seeing her like this, knowing all the pain she had endured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in the living room, Ethan and Darren could hear her crying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's fists were clenched tight, his body tense with barely contained fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could the Elvador family treat her like this?" His mind seethed with anger. "Those bastards... they'll pay for what they've done!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His thoughts were a whirlwind of rage, and with barely a second thought, he stormed out of the villa and into the sleek black Maybach parked outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The engine roared to life as the car sped off, leaving a trail of dust behind it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Darren stood frozen in the living room, the weight of guilt pressing down on him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room felt suffocating, every corner filled with the heavy realization of his past mistakes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mind replayed every cruel word, every harsh action he had ever taken against Aurora, and now, it felt like a thousand knives stabbing at his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't stand being in the room any longer. He turned and left quickly, his footsteps quick and heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the school gates, Lily stood with an umbrella in hand, her eyes bright with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black Maybach came speeding toward her, </span><span>its </span><span>tires splashing through the water on the pavement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's face lit up, and she waved the umbrella enthusiastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the car didn't slow down. It zipped past her like a streak of lightning, the gust of wind blowing her hair into a mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at the license plate</span><span>, knowing for certain that this was the same car Ethan had driven last night</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had promised to come by this morning to pick up her umbrella.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, barely a day had passed, and he had already forgotten about her. He didn't even think to slow down as he drove right past her school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her smile vanished in an instant, replaced by a cold, steely look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So typical," she </span><span>muttered</span><span> </span><span>bitterly. "Rich people are just as arrogant as the Elvador family."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="115.html">« Prev</a><a href="117.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
