He drove out of Orley Central Hospital and headed toward his destination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, halfway there, he seemed to have suddenly thought of something and stopped the car in front of a flower shop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Saturday, and the shop was bustling with customers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dressed casually, Darren stood out among the crowd. Tall, handsome, with neatly combed hair, he exuded an aura of careless charm, his presence effortlessly drawing attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shop attendant noticed him instantly, her smile wide as she greeted him warmly, "Sir, are you buying flowers for someone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mm," he responded lazily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since he was going to visit Aurora, it wouldn't feel right to go empty-handed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was so pitiful. A bouquet of flowers seemed like a small gesture, but maybe it would brighten her day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But deep down, the real reason was that he had always treated her coldly in the past. So today, as he visited her at the hospital, he wanted to offer a flower as an apology for his past behavior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, being </span><span>proud and full of egos</span><span>, there was no way he would </span><span>apologize to her</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attendant asked again, "May I ask if the flowers are for a man or a woman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A woman," Darren answered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attendant looked him over quickly, her eyes glimmering with understanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her smile deepened as she said, "Leave it to us, sir. We'll make sure you're satisfied."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren didn't say much. He didn't know much about flowers anyway, so he let the shop handle it. He would simply wait to pick up the bouquet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, he stood at the door of the flower shop, smoking a cigarette.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The charming young man, with his good looks and nonchalant air, effortlessly attracted the attention of passersby, especially the girls, who couldn't help but glance his way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some even seemed eager to approach him, hoping to ask for his numbers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, a young and beautiful girl mustered up the courage, took out her phone, and walked toward Darren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she was about to reach him, the shop attendant suddenly appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, your flowers are ready."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bouquet of stunning red roses was presented in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he wasn't very knowledgeable about flowers, he knew what red roses represented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, red roses weren't appropriate for Aurora, a sick patient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought about refusing, but with so many people around, as the heir of the Lowell family and a key doctor at Orley Central Hospital, he couldn't possibly back out. That would be too embarrassing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyway, Aurora didn't have much of an interest in these things. She probably wouldn't even understand what the red roses symbolized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Darren silently accepted the flowers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attendant winked at him as if saying, "Good luck, I'm rooting for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the girl who had been trying to approach him, thinking she might get his numbers, glanced at the large bouquet of roses and quickly understood</span><span> that he might have a girlfriend</span><span>. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blushing, she awkwardly turned and ran off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren casually took out some cash and handed it to the attendant, not even bothering to ask for change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attendant took the money with a smile and said, "Have a good day, sir."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren returned to his car, placing the flowers in the passenger seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He started the car and continued driving toward Orley Caring Hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the way, he couldn't help but glance at the bouquet, imagining Aurora's tearful and grateful expression when she saw the flowers, and he smiled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he arrived at Orley Caring Hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Darren didn't work there, he often came to attend conferences, and with his handsome appearance, all the medical staff knew him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they saw him walking in and carrying such a large bouquet of bright red roses, they all stared at him with gossip-filled, ambiguous, and curious expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dr. Lowell, are you visiting a patient?" a nurse teased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren smiled slightly, "</span><span>Yep</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked up to the nurse's station and casually asked, "Is there a person named Aurora Elvador here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nurse hesitated for a moment, then nodded. "Oh, Aurora? She's in Room 12 on the third floor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't surprising that the nurse remembered Aurora. After all, her husband was so handsome, even more so than Darren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, the nurse couldn't help but wonder </span><span>if it was the right thing for Darren to do - visiting someone&rsquo;s wife with red roses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren didn't care about the odd looks from others. He thanked them and walked briskly to Aurora's room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon arriving at the door to the room, he expected to find her bedridden, weak from illness. However, to his surprise, the room was empty, without a soul in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart sank. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had Aurora already left?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was wondering, he heard the sound of a toilet flushing from the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, Aurora, wearing a hospital gown, walked out from inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she unexpectedly saw Darren, her mind went blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time she came back to her senses</span><span>, her already pale face became even more colorless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How did Darren find me here?</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Does that mean the Elvador family knows I'm here now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the thought, </span><span>Aurora felt a chill run through her body. </span><span>In no time</span><span>, she turned and ran.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing </span><span>that</span><span>, Darren threw the bouquet of roses onto the bed, and then quickly caught up with Aurora in just a few steps. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed her wrist and forcefully pulled her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you running? </span><span>I don&rsquo;t bite.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora widened her eyes in terror, struggling desperately but unable to break free. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were filled with fear. "What do you want? Did the Elvador family send you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of being dragged back to that family, where they would accuse her without hesitation, made her body tremble uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren felt helpless. He released her wrist, his expression softening slightly. "I just came to see you. Don't think the worst of me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"See me?" Aurora's face twisted with bitterness and sarcasm. "You're all in on it, all trying to harm me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being misunderstood made Darren feel very wronged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His temper flared up instantly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed the red roses from the bed and forcefully tossed them into her arms, growling, "If I wanted to harm you, would I go through the trouble of buying flowers to see you? </span><span>You misunderstood me</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was startled by the sudden bouquet. The roses were heavy, and when thrown into her arms, they hit her chest. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't hold back, and tears spilled down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren froze, caught completely off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, why are you crying?" he said, somewhat irritated, with a hint of anger in his voice. "You don't like red roses? If you don't like them, just say so. Why are you crying like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never experienced such an awkward situation before. It was his first time giving someone flowers, and it ended with her crying because she didn't like them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop crying, it's annoying. Just tell me what you like, and I'll buy it for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was so fed up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't afraid of Aurora's cold words, but he feared seeing her in this pitiful state, as if he had bullied her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he had a sharp tongue, his actions betrayed him. He reached for the roses in her arms, intending to take them and throw them into the trash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as his hand was about to touch the flowers, someone appeared at the door of the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I seem to have come at the wrong time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren froze, his hand halting midair. He turned to look at the newcomer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tall </span><span>man</span><span> stood in the doorway, his posture straight and commanding. The well-tailored high-end suit he wore exuded an air of superiority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was chiseled and sharp, his features deep and distinct. A pair of gold-rimmed glasses rested on his </span><span>tall </span><span>nose, and through the lenses, his piercing eyes studied them. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere around him radiated an overwhelming presence, making those around him feel the weight of his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian didn't answer immediately. His gaze shifted from Darren to Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw her holding the large bouquet of roses, tears in her eyes, he narrowed his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Was she moved to tears just from receiving a bouquet of flowers?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="74.html">« Prev</a><a href="76.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
