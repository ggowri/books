Even men like Barnett and Adolph seemed lackluster in comparison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was momentarily stunned but swiftly regained her composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All she desired was to find a secluded spot and be alone for a while. Little did she expect to encounter someone in the stairwell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had intended to turn around and leave, yet she had already stepped inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just a stranger, and Aurora didn't deem it necessary to pay much heed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, she felt a sense of relief. Supporting her injured leg, she slowly made her way down the steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Aurora passed by Julian, the smoke wafting from the cigarette in his hand reached her. A pungent smell of tobacco filled her nostrils, causing a brief moment of dizziness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stopped and looked at Julian. He was already watching her and noticed her slight frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry," he said politely, about to put out his cigarette.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Aurora stopped him. "Do you have another cigarette? Can I have one?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian was surprised, staring at her in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked pale and tired, clearly dealing with something heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a word, Julian took out a cigarette from the pack and offered it to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you," Aurora murmured as she accepted the cigarette. Imitating Julian, she placed it between her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scraping sound of a lighter being turned on reached her ears. Subsequently, a sturdy hand came into view. The flame danced in the dim stairwell, casting a glow on both their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was slightly taken aback. She bowed her head and, lighting the cigarette by Julian, took a deep draw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The taste of nicotine immediately permeated her lungs. Almost choking, she quickly expelled the smoke from her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Aurora wasn't used to smoking, Julian raised an eyebrow but stayed quiet, pulling his hand back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora sat on the steps and smoked silently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd seen many men smoke when upset, but now she realized it didn't help her mood at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stairwell was silent, except for the soft crackle of burning cigarettes and their slowly fading smoke rings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian finished smoking his cigarette first. He tossed the butt into the nearby trash can.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He strode up the steps, his footsteps reverberating through the stairwell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Julian was about to exit the stairwell, he glanced downward. He beheld Aurora's motionless, skinny, and solitary figure, as well as the faint glimmer at her fingertips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian paused briefly before continuing on his way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora lingered in the stairwell for a considerable time before leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was in a daze, weary, and all she yearned for was to return to the ward and lie down to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when Aurora pushed open the door of the ward, she discovered that someone was already there, and it was the very person she least wished to see.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery was seated quietly by the window. The sunlight streamed in, casting a soft halo around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora knew that he was not soft at all, but rather sharp as a knife to the heart, making it impossible to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Hubery looked up and saw Aurora enter, he immediately stood up and moved to assist her, but Aurora adroitly evaded his reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's hand hung suspended in mid-air. Clenching his fist, he feigned nonchalance. "Aurora, where have you been?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora ignored him and climbed straight into bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flush of embarrassment crept across Hubery's face. "Aurora, would you like some fruit? I could peel some for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora cast </span><span>him </span><span>a cold glance, her tone dripping with annoyance. "Mr. Winston, you're a busy man. You wouldn't be here without a reason. Let's cut to the chase."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her icy demeanor made Hubery feel </span><span>uneasy</span><span>. </span><span>H</span><span>e asked </span><span>directly</span><span>, "Aurora, did you push Bertha downstairs?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora thought to herself, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">"No wonder he's here. It's all about Bertha again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Five years ago, to protect Bertha, Hubery framed me and sent me to prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Now, five years later, hearing that Bertha was pushed downstairs, is he back to hound me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I did it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery had anticipated that Aurora would either deny or offer an explanation. Instead, she admitted it outright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Aurora in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora simply looked at him coldly, her eyes filled with scorn. "Mr. Winston, how do you plan to punish me this time? Will you send me back to prison? For how long? Five years? Or ten?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each word was like a dagger, piercing Hubery's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery felt as if his throat was constricted, rendering him speechless for some time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, we're childhood friends. You know I wouldn't do that to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had she not endured five years behind bars, she might have been gullible enough to believe him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, no matter how many fancy words Hubery said, Aurora would never believe him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had no desire to see Hubery, let alone listen to his false platitudes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Winston, if you're not here to send me to prison, you can leave. If you intend to sue me, I'm ready for that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery said mournfully, "Aurora, I came simply to care about you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora replied icily, "I don't need your concern."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her repeated rejections were pushing Hubery to the brink of breakdown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery took a step forward, his eyes filled with desperation and pain. "Aurora, what do I have to do to earn your forgiveness? Can't you sense my care for you at all? Since you were released, I've visited you whenever I could. You always brush me off. What do you really want? Just tell me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora finally met his gaze directly, her eyes like twin blades. "I spent five years in prison. I didn't even feel aggrieved, but you, the lawyer who used false evidence, seemed so distraught. Mr. Winston, you study law. Don't you understand the significance of innocence to a person?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's face paled, and he felt a deep sense of sadness welling up inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't want this to happen, but he had no choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha had been kind to Hubery. Without her financial support for his college education, he would never have graduated successfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Bertha was</span><span> the rich heiress</span><span>, she wasn't snobby like others. She was genuinely kind-hearted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery couldn't believe that Bertha would push Camille down the stairs. Given that Joshua and Celeste had both identified Aurora, even if he doubted her guilt, Aurora was the most likely suspect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Aurora sadly, hoping she could comprehend his predicament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's eyes were filled with helplessness and struggle. "Aurora, regardless of what happened in the past, we must move on. Why do you insist on dwelling on it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Hubery's words, Aurora felt as if she had just heard the most ludicrous joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Hubery hadn't been hit, he could never have known how much Aurora was hurting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora saw Hubery for what he actually was that day, a fool who had wronged her without knowing right from wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been wrongly accused, but she couldn't afford to make a fuss. If she did, others would think she was petty and unable to let go of the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora felt an overwhelming sense of sadness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She regretted not seeing through Hubery's true nature sooner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Aurora had known what kind of person Hubery was from the start, she wouldn't have toiled so hard for money, competing in various contests to earn extra cash to support his studies during college.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had been afraid that Hubery would worry, so she never dared to deliver the money in person. She had only helped him anonymously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never expected that the first thing the law student she had supported would do after graduating was to use his legal knowledge to send her to prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, he was asking Aurora to move on.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="35.html">« Prev</a><a href="37.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
