Please forgive me, okay?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I really know I was wrong.

I</span><span>'</span><span>ll never let you go. Please, give me one more chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Disgusted, Lily grabbed his hair and, with a loud "slap," struck him hard across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She immediately cursed, her voice full of anger, "Now you realize you</span><span>'</span><span>re wrong? Where were you when Aurora was crippled by you bastards? She</span><span>'</span><span>ll never recover from this. Do you really think a few words of regret can erase the suffering she's endured?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Lily kicked Adolph, sending him crashing to the ground. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then stepped on his chest, looking down at him with disdain. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look clearly, I</span><span>'</span><span>m not Aurora, but I can tell you very clearly that Aurora will never forgive you for the rest of her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you truly feel sorry for Aurora, then just die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph was still heavily drunk, his consciousness muddled. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached out, gripping Lily</span><span>'</span><span>s ankle tightly, pleading, "Aurora, don</span><span>'</span><span>t be so heartless. I really want to make up for it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily looked at him with disgust, raising her foot and forcefully pulling away, the sole of her shoe leaving a red mark on his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Make up for it? Do you think a few words of apology and some tears can make up for the wrongs you</span><span>'</span><span>ve done?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily</span><span>'</span><span>s voice trembled with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora is such a good person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If she hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t met the Elvador family, the Sherwood family, and Hubery, her life wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t have ended up like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You and those people, when you harmed Aurora like that, did you ever think about today?" Every word Lily spoke seemed to come through clenched teeth. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She was so kind, so innocent. How could you all do this to her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily</span><span>'</span><span>s eyes reddened as she thought of Aurora limping and losing her hearing. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart felt as though it was being stabbed by countless needles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily took a deep breath, trying to calm herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What</span><span>'</span><span>s the use of saying all this now? If you really know you were wrong, then go die. Only by dying will you truly atone for your sins."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Lily raised her foot and kicked Adolph one more time, then turned and decisively walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel stood from the sofa and walked over to Adolph, casting him a cold glance before saying, "If you loved her so much, why didn't you cherish her? You deserve this</span><span>!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, without another word, he strode after Lily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Walker, where are you going?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"None of your business. Don't follow me." Lily didn't even look back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It</span><span>'</span><span>s not safe at night. Let me take you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily suddenly turned around, "I</span><span>'</span><span>m in a bad mood right now. If you don</span><span>'</span><span>t want to get hit, stay away from me. I</span><span>'</span><span>ll be your girlfriend again tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she left the bar without looking back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The night air was cool. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily stood outside the bar, her eyes filled with coldness and exhaustion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a sleek black luxury car suddenly pulled up at the bar's entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car door opened, and a man and a woman stepped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was dressed in a sharp suit, his face cold and severe. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Adolph's father, Wilson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman had delicate features, but her eyes were filled with urgency. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Adolph's mother, Lizeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The couple hurried straight toward the bar, clearly there to find Adolph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before they could enter, a woman suddenly appeared and blocked their path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Move aside." Wilson was clearly impatient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the woman didn't budge. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, she looked at him with a smirk, her gaze sharp. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wilson Sherwood, have you forgotten me so quickly? After I got out of prison, I</span><span>'</span><span>ve been thinking about finding you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wilson</span><span>'</span><span>s expression stiffened, and he carefully studied the woman in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman was in her thirties, dressed simply, but there was a long scar on her face, making her appear unsettling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were full of hostility, clearly not someone to be messed with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was Zoey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like you do remember me, Mr. Wilson Sherwood," Zoey said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Wilson and Lizeth recognized her, their faces turned deathly pale as if they had just seen a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoey and Aurora had almost entered prison around the same time. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had lost a business competition to a rival and often caused trouble for others. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In one intense confrontation, she stabbed the other party with a knife, even slashing people on the street to vent her frustrations with life. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, she was sentenced to twenty years in prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t have been released so early.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A</span><span>fter entering prison, the Sherwood family found her and made a deal. If she tortured Aurora in prison, they would use their influence to reduce her sentence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since then, Aurora</span><span>'</span><span>s time in prison had been nothing short of hell, worse than death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did Zoey brutally beat her, but Joshua, Isabella, and Bertha had also bribed other inmates to torment her endlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now out of prison, </span><span>she</span><span> had come to find the Sherwood family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wilson's face darkened instantly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a step back as if the woman before him were a plague.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lizeth, on the other hand, covered her mouth in shock, her eyes filled with panic and dread. "You... What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoey flashed a mocking smile as she stepped closer to Wilson, her expression becoming even more terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do I want? Mr. Wilson Sherwood, your memory seems to be quite poor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She extended her finger and lightly tapped Wilson's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I worked for you in prison, and now that I</span><span>'</span><span>m out, it</span><span>'</span><span>s time for you to pay up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wilson frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We already paid you. We got your sentence reduced."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoey let out a cold laugh, her scar twisting with her expression, making her appear even more menacing. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Reduced my sentence? Do you think that</span><span>'</span><span>s enough? I'm out now, penniless. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I won</span><span>'</span><span>t ask for more. I just want one million dollars. Give me the money, and I</span><span>'</span><span>ll leave Orley immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the Sherwood family in its prime, one million dollars would have been pocket change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after being suppressed by Julian, the Sherwood Group was on the brink of bankruptcy, its financial chain already broken and on the verge of collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he possibly come up with one million </span><span>in one go</span><span>?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lizeth's face twisted in anger. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is blackmail! We</span><span>'</span><span>ll report you to the police!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, the woman suddenly burst into laughter. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Report me? If I end up in prison again, I</span><span>'</span><span>ll expose everything about our deal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wilson's face turned even paler. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this came to light, he wouldn't just be ruined. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could end up behind bars himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long silence, Wilson clenched his teeth. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine.
