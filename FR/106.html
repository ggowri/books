"Has anyone ever told you that you're quite handsome?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her finger gently traced the red wine stain on the golden tablecloth as she continued, "It's just that your appearance is all polished and pretty, but inside, it's something else entirely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For five long years, she had struggled in the darkness, her body battered and broken, but her mind had grown stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph, however, seemed blinded by his own confidence, radiating an absurd kind of stupidity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora turned her head away, not wanting to look at him any longer, her posture full of disdain as if she were shooing away a bothersome fly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph swallowed hard, wanting to say something, but no words came out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced one last time at Aurora. But she was already leaning into Julian's embrace. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man in a perfectly tailored suit hugged her thin shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian stood tall, his aura cool and composed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Aurora exuded a fragile grace, her beauty was undeniable. They made an ideal pair. Adolph's heart churned with jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had known Aurora first, yet somehow, it was Julian standing by her side now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how much he resented it, it was all pointless. He could only be taken away by the police.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief, tense silence, the atmosphere in the ballroom slowly returned to life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>m</span><span>e</span><span>n's </span><span>eyes were full of deep caution when they looked at Julian, instinctively wary of a man of his power. The women, however, looked at Aurora with envy. They admired how she had Julian's unwavering protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guests moved forward, presenting meticulously prepared birthday gifts to Beatrice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each gift was worth a fortune, bearing the sender's flattery and ingratiation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice sat at the head of the table, her face adorned with a warm smile as she </span><span>graciously accepted each gift, thanking everyone for their thoughtful gestures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, it was Aurora's turn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Aurora slowly walked forward, each step heavy as if her feet were filled with lead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her head was bowed, her voice full of guilt and self-reproach, "Madam Hawke, I'm so sorry. It's my fault. I failed to protect the embroidery of "The Garden" that Mr. Hawke had prepared for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her month at Hawke Estate, Beatrice had been nothing but kind to her. The love Beatrice showed warmed Aurora's cold heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice noticed Aurora's frailty and made her all sorts of nourishing dishes. In just a month, Aurora's cheeks gained a healthy color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Aurora's leg pain flared up, Beatrice hired a masseuse to ease her discomfort every day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora knew she was flawed, but Beatrice never once looked down on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her haggard appearance, Beatrice always complimented her beauty. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora</span><span> </span><span>had once been so angry </span><span>that </span><span>she had tried to hurt her parents</span><span>.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still,</span><span> </span><span>Beatrice called her gentle and kind. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though s</span><span>he </span><span>felt out of place beside Julian</span><span> and</span><span> was too broken to deserve him</span><span>,</span><span> Beatrice always assured her that Julian was lucky to have met her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora could tell that Beatrice was trying to match her with Julian, but she didn't dare hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She saw Julian as a distant star in the night sky, glorious and untouchable. She knew he should be with someone from a family like his, someone beautiful and whole, not a damaged, broken person like her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes began to well up as those thoughts swirled in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Beatrice quickly reached out, taking her hand and giving it a gentle pat, "It's not your fault, my dear. They're wrong. The embroidery doesn't matter. I know </span><span>you poured your heart into the gift</span><span>, and that's what makes me happy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice's compassion only made Aurora feel more deeply touched. Her nose tingled, and tears threatened to fall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Julian's voice cut through the air, sharp and cold. "It is your fault."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice spun toward him, wide-eyed in surprise</span><span>. She had no idea why Julian said so while Aurora was already ashamed of herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then </span><span>Beatrice shot Julian a fierce look, silently warning him not to make Aurora feel worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Julian didn't seem to notice her gaze. His expression remained unchanged as he calmly added, "You'll have to re-stitch it. If you don't finish, you're not leaving</span><span> the</span><span> </span><span>Hawke Estate</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora froze, lifting her</span><span> tear-brimmed</span><span> eyes to meet his. </span><span>She looked quite pitiful</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight stirred something in Julian, making him feel a rush of heat. He loosened his patterned tie, his Adam's apple shifting under the black silk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice realized what Julian was doing, and a smile tugged at her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, her grandson got a clue, using this excuse to keep Aurora around him. She knew her efforts would take off eventually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian</span><span> </span><span>turned his gaze to Aurora, "Ms. Elvador, what do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Aurora, this wasn't really a punishment at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the Hawke Estate, she didn't have to worry about survival. There were people who cared for her. She had a spacious, beautifully lit room and her very own studio.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she worked, she was never disturbed. </span><span>Th</span><span>ere</span><span>, everyone treated her with respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the life she had always dreamed of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," she whispered, her voice slightly hoarse, with an almost imperceptible hint of joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian showed a smile, his eyes revealing a moment of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his eyes, Aurora was as easy to please as always.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He narrowed his eyes, looking her over intently as though he could swallow her whole. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice, watching it all, felt a twinge of unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Julian well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was calculating, and Aurora was so innocent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps in the end, even if Julian were to deceive her into his trap, Aurora would still believe him to be a good man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After exchanging a few more words with Beatrice, Julian was led away by a group of sharply dressed men to discuss some complex business matters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice looked at Aurora with tenderness in her eyes, "Aurora, you must be hungry after a long day. Go have something to eat. Talk to whoever you like, and ignore those you don't. Just do what makes you feel comfortable. And don't drink any alcohol."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice spoke gently as if giving advice to her most beloved granddaughter, her voice warm and full of affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora nodded. She grabbed a glass of juice, and then slowly made her way to the balcony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sky had long since turned dark, the night draped over the world like a heavy black satin sheet, with only a few faint stars scattered across it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cool night breeze brushed against her hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood there quietly as if blending into the stillness of the night, her exhaustion and worries slowly melting away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, her mind buzzed with the constant ringing in her ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the violent beating and pushing she'd endured from Judy and the others, her hearing had never quite been the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing her juice, she pulled up a chair, sat down, and rested her arms on the balcony railing, letting her head lean into her hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The exhaustion washed over her. She slowly closed her eyes, and before long, she slipped into a light sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A while later, Julian finished his business. He casually turned around and spotted her curled up on the balcony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dim light cast a soft glow on her, highlighting her delicate form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's gaze softened. </span><span>Before he knew it, he had already gotten near her</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood beside her, studying her face intently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's cheek was slightly flushed from lying for too long, her brows furrowed in a </span><span>way that suggested she wasn't resting peacefully even in her sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian took off his jacket and gently draped it over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he bent down slightly, lifting her into his arms, careful not to wake her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stirred slightly in her sleep, sensing the warmth, and nestled closer into his embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian watched her, </span><span>smiling gently</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan, who had been watching from a distance, couldn't help but grin mischievously. "Mr. Hawke, you're getting more and more concerned about Ms. Elvador. Are you starting to like her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian froze for a moment, then turned to look at Ethan's smiling face. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coldly, he responded, "Your bonus for this month is gone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan instantly stopped smiling, his face falling. "Why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because you talk too much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan regretted it immediately, </span><span>not knowing why his boss did that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hurried to catch up with Julian, rubbing his hands together and smiling awkwardly. "By the way, Mr. Hawke, can you reimburse me for my sock?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian thought of Adolph's ridiculous state when he had been stuffed with stinky socks and </span><span>his mood got better</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's spirits lifted again. "Mr. Hawke, you're the most handsome man in the world."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Talk again, and I'll have you work overtime at the office."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan quickly shut </span><span>up </span><span>and followed behind Julian.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="105.html">« Prev</a><a href="107.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
