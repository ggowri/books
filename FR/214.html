She was completely different from her usual gentle demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora blinked, surprised. She had never seen Laura this fierce, looking like she was ready to tear apart anyone who had hurt her child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura rushed to Aurora's side, her face filled with worry as she checked over her body. "Baby, are you hurt? Tell Mommy where it hurts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William, his handsome face now twisted with anger, added, "Tell me who did this to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Aurora could speak, Bertha interrupted with a petulant voice, "She didn't give me the dress I wanted, so it's all her fault. I'm just doing what she deserves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett chimed in from the side, "Exactly. She dared to fight with my sister for the dress, so she deserves it. All the pretty dresses should be my sister's, only she looks better in them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William turned his murderous gaze toward Barnett and Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste, seeing the fierce look in William's eyes, immediately became outraged. "What kind of look is that? This whole store full of dresses, and you take them all for yourselves? How selfish can you be? Clearly, you've had no proper upbringing. I wonder how your parents raised you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At such a young age, you act like this&mdash;wait until you're older. You'll be taught a lesson by someone," Celeste spat, berating them harshly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora hated Celeste's bias, always protecting Bertha without a second thought. It was because of Celeste's favoritism that she had suffered so much at the hands of the Elvador family in her past life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could tolerate the mistreatment herself, but now Celeste was going after Laura and William? Aurora couldn't take it anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Aurora was about to snap, Laura suddenly spoke up. "Let me show you exactly how I raise my daughter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Aurora, pointed at Bertha, and asked, "Sweetie, was it her who tried to take your dress?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora nodded obediently, still unsure where this was going.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura's voice turned firm. "Listen to me. If someone tries to take what's yours, take it back. If they push you around, hit back twice as hard. Don't be afraid. We will always have your back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked right into Aurora's eyes, her expression full of encouragement, showing her through actions that doing what's right was never something to shy away from.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora felt a wave of warmth crash over her. Her chest swelled with courage.</span><br><span>So this is what it feels like&mdash;to be believed in, to be backed up, completely and unconditionally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nodded hard. "Got it, Mom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she turned toward Bertha.</span><br><span>She bullied me in the last life, and now she's trying it again in this one? Fine. We'll settle both lifetimes' debts right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, Aurora raised her hand and slapped Bertha across the face. The sound echoed, and Bertha hit the floor. Aurora didn't stop. She climbed on top of her and started punching, one after the other, like rapid-fire. Bertha burst into loud, snotty sobs as she was pummeled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste and Barnett were stunned. They hadn't expected Aurora to go full beast-mode right in front of them. Both surged forward to pull her off, but Laura stepped in and blocked Celeste, while William stopped Barnett cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura smiled, but there was no warmth in it, "What's the matter? Kids getting into it, and you wanna play the adult card now? What, thinking of ganging up on a five-year-old?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's face flushed scarlet. "Is this seriously how you teach your child?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura raised her chin, her gentle image long gone. The energy around her had shifted&mdash;sharp, queen-like, and utterly unbothered. "Exactly. And if you don't like it? That's your problem, not mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You what? Your daughter started it, and now you're mad she's getting a taste of her own medicine? No wonder she's such a spoiled child. You're the one showing her how it's done." Laura didn't hold back. Her words hit like slaps, leaving Celeste speechless and on the verge of tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While holding Celeste back, Laura still had time to coach Aurora mid-fight. "Left hook, sweetie, now the right&mdash;yes, just like that! Teach her a lesson she'll remember. You're amazing, baby! Don't let her get a single shot in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura's face was flushed with excitement. Celeste's was red too&mdash;but from rage and despair. Watching Bertha's face swell and bruise, nose bleeding and all, nearly sent her into a faint. "I'm done with this!" Celeste screamed and lunged at Laura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura dodged the wild swipe and, without hesitation, grabbed a fistful of Celeste's perfectly styled hair and yanked hard. That carefully curled hair? Turned into a mess, clumps coming out by the handful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll kill you!" Celeste shrieked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And just like that, the two moms were in a full-on catfight. Laura had the upper hand from the start. Celeste's face was scratched up, her hair a mess, patches missing, makeup smeared. She looked like she'd been dragged through a war zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, William and Barnett were also going at it, throwing punches and kicks like they meant it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The store was a mess. Staff stood frozen in shock until someone finally snapped out of it and rushed to get the manager. With the manager and several clerks pulling people apart, the chaos finally started to die down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha? Celeste barely recognized her anymore. That once cute little face was now swollen, bruised, and bleeding. Aurora had worked her over good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste looked even worse. Her hair was ripped out, her face scratched, and blood trickled down her cheek. She looked like she'd gone twelve rounds with a tiger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Barnett? His nose was gushing blood, his lip was busted, and his shirt was torn to shreds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had walked into the store looking polished, proud, and full of themselves. Now? One word: wrecked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked at the mess they'd become and couldn't help letting out a snort of laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her previous life, this group always put on a perfect front. It wasn't until Julian helped her get revenge that their downfall finally began. But this time, she had the pleasure of doing it with her own hands. Beating them into swollen faces? That pent-up frustration vanished in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura pointed at Celeste and said coldly, "Since you didn't actually manage to hurt my daughter, I'll consider today a warning. But if she so much as loses a strand of hair next time, I'll break your legs. Now get lost."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Elvador family matriarch, Celeste had never been humiliated like this in her life. She was dying to claw Laura's face to shreds, but remembering what just happened, she knew she didn't stand a chance. Grinding her teeth, she hissed, "You'd better watch your backs. Trash! I won't let this go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura rolled her eyes. "Who are you calling trash? Seriously, look at yourselves. Shame on you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste was so furious she nearly passed out on the spot. Dragging Barnett and Bertha along with her, she stormed out without another word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This trip to Putnam hadn't just been about leisure. Joshua also intended to expand their business here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Putnam had four major families, and at the top of that pyramid was the prestigious Hawke family. They were old money and nearly impossible to approach. But even if they couldn't cozy up to the Hawkes, there were still three other powerful families&mdash;the Barrons, the Hunters, and the Mills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they could secure a relationship with any one of them, it would give the Elvador family the perfect entry point into Putnam's elite circles. Joshua was already working on getting in touch with someone from those three houses. If all went well, they'd have solid footing here in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And once we're established? Finding that family from earlier will be child's play. They'll be blacklisted with a single word. That's what happens when you mess with the Elvador family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura couldn't have cared less about their empty threats. She felt great after the fight&mdash;absolutely refreshed. And just like that, she slipped right back into her elegant, composed self.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knelt down to check Aurora from head to toe, gently lifting her hand and frowning when she saw the redness. "Just look at this. Your hand is all red. It must've hurt when you hit her, didn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was stunned.</span><br><span>Mom, do you even hear yourself right now? I am not the one getting hit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though she was speechless, Aurora still felt warm inside. She shook her head. "I'm okay, Mom. It doesn't hurt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura pouted, "But Mommy's heart hurts just seeing your hand like this. Only one of your sweet kisses can make it better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William leaned in too. "Beating people up is exhausting. I need a kiss from you too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was completely speechless again but still gave each of them a big smooch. Laura and William beamed like they'd just won the lottery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Laura pulled out a card and handed it to the store clerk. "Pack up all the clothes we picked out and send them to Barron Estate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clerk's eyes lit up at the mention of Barron Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wait&mdash;Barron Estate? No wonder they bought over a hundred outfits without even blinking. A few million dollars is pocket change to people like them. It's a good thing I made the right call earlier and backed the right girl. Otherwise, this store might've gone under before the season even ends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Excitedly, the clerk swiped the card and handed it back with both hands. "Of course, Mrs. Barron. We'll make sure everything gets delivered as soon as possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the shopping done and the day getting late, the three of them headed home in good spirits to start preparing for Aurora's birthday party tomorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Aurora's first birthday since joining the Barron family, and both Benjamin and Laura agreed that it had to be a grand affair. They were planning to invite every influential name in Orley to celebrate Aurora's birthday and to officially announce her identity as the Barron family's heiress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste returned to the hotel with Barnett and Bertha in tow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua almost didn't recognize them at first. When he realized it was his wife and children, his face twisted in shock. "What happened to you all?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste was fuming as she recounted everything that had gone down at the children's store.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett jumped in to back her up. "Dad, you have to stand up for us. You have no idea how arrogant they were."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha threw herself into Joshua's arms, sobbing as if the world had ended. "Daddy, my face hurts. My whole body hurts. She sat on top of me and just kept hitting me. It was horrible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's expression darkened. "Unbelievable. They laid hands on my family? Do they have a death wish?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after a pause, his tone grew cautious. "Still, if they can afford to buy out that many designer pieces without blinking, they're probably not just some nobody. Putnam is full of hidden power players. Offending the wrong person could cost us big time. We'll have to tread carefully."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste scoffed, "That woman? Crude and classless. Even if she's rich, she's just another nouveau riche upstart. We, the Elvador family, are an established name in Orley. I'm not afraid of a tacky millionaire."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She added, eyes glinting, "Besides, we're about to land a partnership with one of the four great families. Once we've got that backing, what can a vulgar woman like her possibly do to us? Have you made contact with any of them yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua frowned. "Those families are on a whole different level. Even for someone like me, it's hard to get close. But I did meet someone from the Carter family, who's just a step below them. And guess what? I found out tomorrow is the Barron family's young daughter's birthday party."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lowered his voice as if sharing a secret. "We'll use that as our way in. Go to the party, mingle a bit. With the kind of guests they'll have, we'll be rubbing shoulders with all the right people."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's eyes gleamed with malice. "Perfect. After tomorrow, we'll have all the support we need. Then I'll make that vile woman and her family regret ever crossing us. Let's see how long they last once we're done with them. I'll make sure they go broke and end up begging on the streets."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua nodded. "But first things first&mdash;we need the perfect gift for the Barron family's little princess. Any ideas?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How old is she?" Celeste asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"About the same age as Bertha, I think."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste tapped her finger against her chin thoughtfully. "Kids that age love pretty things&mdash;dresses, toys... it doesn't need to be expensive, but it has to feel special. How about a stuffed animal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua considered it, and a sly gleam crept into his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the girl likes the toy enough to keep it in her room, and I embed a listening device inside, who knows what secrets we can pick up? Even if there are no secrets, just learning about her preferences can help us get closer to her. Win her over, and earning the Barrons' favor will be a walk in the park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Celeste. "Perfect. Let's go with that. You should get your face cleaned up and tend to the kids' injuries. Tomorrow, we're going to that party, and we need to look flawless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he looked down at Bertha. "Sweetheart, you have an important job tomorrow&mdash;make sure the birthday girl likes you. If she does, everything else will fall into place. Our whole future might depend on it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beyond that, there is still the Barron family's young heir. If Bertha can win his heart, she might even marry into their family one day. That alone will be enough to push the Elvador family into a whole new league.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if things don't go that far, being close to the Barron boy will open doors to the other heirs of the Hawke, Hunter, and Mills families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua looked at Bertha, confidence shining in his eyes.</span><br><span>She's my little girl. She is charming and lovable. She'll have those boys eating out of her hand in no time.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="213.html">« Prev</a><a href="215.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
