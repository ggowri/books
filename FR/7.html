Out of everyone at Elvador Villa, Daisy alone had shown her real kindness, treating her like she belonged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She remembered how Daisy had dipped into her own savings to buy her a fan when she'd broken out in rashes during those brutal summer months in the stuffy storage room. When winter's chill crept in, it was Daisy who'd quietly slipped her a hot water bottle to fight off the cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These memories brought tears to Aurora's eyes, the simple acts of kindness standing out like beacons against years of loneliness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy saw the injuries on Aurora's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your injuries...Ms. Elvador, let me take care of those injuries. "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's nothing&mdash;just a scratch," Aurora shrugged it off. "I'm used to this stuff."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy's heart ached at those words. No one should be so accustomed to pain that they'd dismiss their injuries like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, Daisy's eyes caught the plastic bag dangling from Aurora's hand. "Ms. Elvador... you're leaving, aren't you?" she asked softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stood there for a moment, struggling to find words before finally giving a simple nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I'm out of here. "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pain flickered across Daisy's features. She wanted to beg Aurora to stay, but the words died in her throat. After all, she'd witnessed firsthand how the Elvadors had treated Aurora&mdash;the constant rejection, the unfairness, the daily humiliations. She couldn't bring herself to ask Aurora to endure more of that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you've made your decision, I won't try to change your mind," Daisy finally said with a heavy sigh. "But please, at least take this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy pulled out a bundle of cash, pushing it into Aurora's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss, The world out there is rough." Her voice cracked as tears started rolling down her cheeks. "Just... just promise me you'll stay safe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora bit her lip, trying to hold back tears but failing as they slid down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It hit her hard&mdash;how this woman, who wasn't even family, showed more care than her actual relatives ever had. Her own parents and brother couldn't spare her a shred of kindness, yet here was Daisy, worried sick about her wellbeing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett slumped in his car in the garage, eyes fixed on the dashcam screen. The footage showed Aurora's fifteen-minute ride home from prison&mdash;she might as well have been a statue. Just sat there, hands folded in her lap, head against the window, completely still.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dress they'd accused her of stealing lay untouched. She hadn't even looked at it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guilt gnawed at his stomach as he remembered their accusations. The weight of it all felt suffocating. Those eyes of hers</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>once warm, now ice-cold&mdash;haunted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remembered how she used to be&mdash;that bright smile whenever he came home, the way she'd call out "Welcome back!" and fuss over him like a mother hen. "You must be exhausted," she'd say, always making sure he had everything he needed after work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett watched her, feeling like he was staring at a stranger instead of his sister. The realization hit him like a truck, bringing a splitting headache. He slumped against the leather seat, shutting his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time blurred until Aurora's voice cut through his thoughts. "Hey Daisy, I got it from here. Head back inside, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Call if you need anything. Stay safe!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's eyes flew open at their exchange. Through the car window, he spotted Aurora and Daisy chatting by the villa's entrance, their silhouettes clear against the building's facade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take care, Daisy," Aurora turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora! Where the hell do you think you're going?" Barnett burst out of the car, his voice shattering the quiet courtyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said stop right there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora kept limping forward like she hadn't heard a word. Her complete dismissal hit him like a punch to the gut. That's when it clicked&mdash;she was actually leaving. For good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear gripped him as he rushed over, grabbing her arm.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="6.html">« Prev</a><a href="8.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
