Please.&quot;</p><p>But Julian didn&#x27;t even blink, as if her words were whispers lost in the void. </p><p>Ashley&#x27;s worry deepened. She opened her mouth to offer comfort, but the words tangled in her throat, caught in a web of grief. </p><p>All she could manage was a helpless sigh. </p><p>Her shoulders sagged as she shook her head and turned away, her footsteps heavy with unseen burdens.</p><p>As she stepped into the hallway, she nearly collided with Beatrice. Beatrice seemed diminished, her spine slightly bowed, her eyes shadowed with exhaustion. She looked as if the past month had aged her a decade.</p><p>&quot;Madam Hawke,&quot; Ashley said urgently. &quot;Please, talk to Mr. Hawke. For over a month now, he&#x27;s done nothing but drink himself into a stupor or sit in that embroidery room, clutching that piece and staring into space. If this goes on, his body won&#x27;t hold up. It&#x27;ll break.&quot;</p><p>Thinking of Aurora, Ashley&#x27;s composure crumbled, tears streaming down her cheeks as her voice caught in sobs. </p><p><em>How could someone as sweet as Aurora be taken from us? </em></p><p><em>How could fate be so cruel?</em></p><p>Beatrice&#x27;s eyes filled with tears instantly. Hearing that Aurora was gone felt like her heart was being torn apart. The pain was so intense that it was almost physical, causing her to faint from the shock more than once.</p><p>For over a month, Beatrice could barely eat or find any rest. In the stillness of night, memories of Aurora&#x27;s bright smile and gentle nature overwhelmed her thoughts. </p><p>Each memory was a fresh stab, sending waves of pain through her heart. This intense sorrow consumed her for weeks, only recently softening into a quieter ache.</p><p>The dead cannot return, so the living must find a way to move on.</p><p>Steeling herself, Beatrice stepped toward the doorway, her gaze settling on the desolate figure inside. &quot;Julian.&quot;</p><p>The room was thick with silence. Julian didn&#x27;t respond.</p><p>She tried again, softer this time. &quot;I know you miss Aurora. I feel that pain too. But she&#x27;s gone. Do you really think she&#x27;d want to see you like this? Please... pull yourself together.&quot;</p><p>Still, silence stretched between them.</p><p>No matter how much she pleaded, Julian remained motionless, lost in his grief.</p><p>A sharp pang of despair struck Beatrice. Her frail body swayed slightly, threatening to buckle.</p><p>Ashley rushed forward to steady her.</p><p>Looking at Julian&#x27;s hollow expression, Beatrice could only feel fate&#x27;s cruel grip twisting their lives into this unbearable tragedy.</p><p>Julian had always been indifferent to women. Nearing thirty, he&#x27;d never shown romantic interest in anyone—so much so that Beatrice had privately wondered if he preferred men.</p><p>Then, finally, Aurora had entered his world... only to be torn away too soon.</p><p>Knowing Julian&#x27;s nature, Beatrice feared he might shut himself off from love forever.</p><p>Truth be told, she wasn&#x27;t fixated on forcing him into marriage. His single status wasn&#x27;t the problem. </p><p>But their family&#x27;s legacy—centuries of power and prestige—couldn&#x27;t vanish with him. There had to be an heir, someone to carry their name forward.</p><p>With a weary exhale, she tried again. &quot;Julian, I&#x27;m not demanding you marry. But our family&#x27;s hundred-year reign can&#x27;t end with you. Just give us a child—boy or girl, it doesn&#x27;t matter. Once there&#x27;s an heir, you&#x27;re free. No strings, no expectations. Live as you please.&quot; Her voice softened, almost pleading. &quot;Please. Can you at least grant me this?&quot;</p><p>Her plea hung thick in the air between them. For the first time since Aurora&#x27;s death, Julian showed a flicker of response.</p><p>&quot;Putnam Hospital&#x27;s cryobank,&quot; he said tonelessly, not meeting her eyes. &quot;My samples are still there. Use them.&quot;</p><p>Beatrice remembered insisting on the preservation years ago—a pragmatic safeguard against his indifference to relationships. Time would only diminish the viability, and the Hawke lineage demanded insurance.</p><p>At least this cold, clinical solution remained when natural conception was impossible.</p><p>&quot;Fine,&quot; she acquiesced, then hesitated. &quot;And the surrogate? Do you have... any requirements?&quot;</p><p>Julian&#x27;s hollow stare didn&#x27;t waver. &quot;Irrelevant.&quot;</p><p>No womb could nurture Aurora&#x27;s child. No genetic material but hers would have mattered. Every alternative was equally meaningless.</p><p>The profound emptiness in his voice pierced Beatrice&#x27;s heart.</p><p>&quot;Then Daniel will handle it,&quot; she murmured, retreating.</p><p>Julian didn&#x27;t respond, his mind still adrift in sorrow. Seeing him so broken, Beatrice said nothing more, letting Ashley guide her away.  </p><p>Three days later, Daniel burst into Hawke Estate, clutching a stack of documents. His face burned with urgency—and something dangerously close to hope.</p><p>&quot;Mr. Hawke,&quot; he gasped, &quot;you need to see this.&quot;</p><p>Julian barely lifted his gaze from the embroidery in his hands, his voice flat. &quot;What now?&quot;</p><p>Daniel took a deep breath, steadying himself before speaking. &quot;Mr. Hawke, two years ago, someone tampered with your sperm sample at Putnam Hospital.&quot;</p><p>A barely perceptible shrug. &quot;And?&quot; Julian murmured, examining a stitch as if this news held no more weight than dinner menu options.</p><p>Daniel&#x27;s grip tightened on the files. He&#x27;d expected this glacial indifference. But what came next—</p><p>Daniel inhaled sharply. &quot;Mr. Hawke, the woman they used for the surrogacy was Aurora.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And the child—&quot; Daniel&#x27;s voice cracked, &quot;—your daughter. She&#x27;s alive.&quot; </p><p>Then, he laid out every piece of information he had uncovered over the past few days.</p><p>As the story unfolded, the icy mask Julian wore began to crack. Those hollow eyes slowly flickered back to life, glinting with a spark of hope.</p><p>He stared at Daniel and asked in a hoarse voice, &quot;I have a daughter? With Aurora?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, Mr. Hawke,&quot; Daniel answered, nodding emphatically.</p><p>A violent shudder rippled through Julian, his entire frame trembling with the weight of what he had just heard.</p><p>The Garden slipped from his paralyzed fingers, its silken threads whispering against the marble floor.</p><p>The truth unfolded like a surgical blade cutting through scar tissue.</p><p>After Aurora&#x27;s forced egg harvesting, Isabella and Frank hadn&#x27;t stayed in Orley. They&#x27;d fled to Putnam, selecting a dozen elite sperm samples—until only one embryo remained viable.</p><p>By cruel fate or divine joke, they&#x27;d chosen Julian&#x27;s.</p><p>Of course, Hawke genetic material came with safeguards. But Isabella&#x27;s network reached further than anyone imagined—her bribes slipping through hospital security like poison through wine.</p><p>The final irony? </p><p>They&#x27;d never known their &quot;premium donor&quot; was the very man who&#x27;d loved their victim.</p><p>Their scheme was brutally pragmatic. </p><p>If the child&#x27;s kidneys matched Isabella&#x27;s or Bertha&#x27;s, she&#x27;d become a living donor. If not, she&#x27;d be leverage to extort her wealthy father. Either way, they stood to profit.</p><p>Fate intervened when Lily—not kidney failure—claimed Isabella&#x27;s life, then somehow tracked down Aurora and Julian&#x27;s child.</p><p>Every sordid detail now lay exposed. Daniel, a battle-hardened special forces veteran, felt his stomach churn at the revelations. </p><p>Aurora&#x27;s brief life had been an unrelenting tempest of suffering, with Julian as her sole respite. Now this child might be the only salve for Julian&#x27;s ravaged soul.</p><p>Each word from Daniel&#x27;s report struck Julian like a physical blow. Slowly, the broken man&#x27;s posture straightened. Dead eyes flickered back to life.</p><p>&quot;Where is she?&quot; Julian&#x27;s voice cracked like dry kindling, hands trembling against his chair arms. &quot;My daughter—where?&quot;</p><p>Daniel&#x27;s chest tightened at the desperate hope in Julian&#x27;s gaze. </p><p>No one understood better how Julian had loved Aurora—deeper than Mariana trenches, brighter than supernovas. This child was their last tether.</p><p>&quot;With Ethan,&quot; Daniel said carefully. &quot;Lily entrusted her to him before dying. His phone&#x27;s been off all day, but I&#x27;ll—&quot;</p><p>Julian surged upright, then collapsed back, gasping. &quot;I... I&#x27;m coming with you.&quot; His skeletal fingers clawed at the chair. &quot;Right now.&quot; </p><p>Then panic flashed across his face. &quot;Wait—I can&#x27;t... not like this.&quot; He touched his hollow cheeks. &quot;She&#x27;ll be frightened. I need to... need to...&quot;</p><p>He stumbled toward the bathroom like a drunkard, muttering about shaving, about clean clothes. Though his body remained cadaverous, his eyes burned with newborn stars.</p><p>&quot;Mr. Hawke.&quot; Daniel reached out, &quot;You need to rest. Let me go get her for you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No,&quot; Julian snapped as he staggered toward the bathroom. &quot;I&#x27;m going. I have to be the one to bring her home.&quot;</p><p>Thirty minutes later, he emerged—a ghost of his former elegance. </p><p>The tailored suit hung loose on his shrunken frame, but his spine was steel. Only the shadows beneath his eyes betrayed his torment.</p><p>The car sped through the streets as Julian sat in the passenger seat, his hands gripping the armrests so tightly that his knuckles whitened. His gaze locked fiercely ahead, as if the sheer force of his will could carry him to his daughter&#x27;s side in an instant.</p><p>Julian&#x27;s mind was filled with thoughts of Aurora&#x27;s face, and he couldn&#x27;t shake the image of their daughter. </p><p>He imagined her calling him &quot;Daddy&quot; and envisioned the happy family they could have been if Aurora were still around.</p><p>Finally, the car came to a screeching halt.</p><p>Two sets of knocks echoed through the dim hallway—first Daniel&#x27;s polite raps, then Julian&#x27;s insistent pounding when silence answered.</p><p>&quot;Ethan!&quot; Daniel&#x27;s voice sharpened as he hammered the door again. &quot;Open up!&quot; Only the hollow thuds answered them.</p><p>Daniel turned to Julian. &quot;Mr. Hawke, looks like he&#x27;s not home.&quot;</p><p>Julian&#x27;s face darkened, a storm brewing in his eyes.</p><p>Ethan hadn&#x27;t been to work in over a month, not since Lily&#x27;s death, and no one knew what he had been doing.</p><p>Julian drew in a deep breath, struggling to anchor himself in a sea of calm, but the restless urgency clawing at his heart refused to be tamed.</p><p>He pounded on the tightly shut door, his fists striking with desperate force as he let out an urgent growl, &quot;Ethan, open the door now!&quot;</p><p>The silence stretched on.</p><p>His body swayed, and he stumbled, his shoulder slamming into the cold wall beside the door.</p><p>Daniel rushed to his side, steadying him. &quot;Mr. Hawke, you okay?&quot;</p><p>Julian shook his head and muttered, &quot;I&#x27;m fine.&quot;</p><p>He raised his eyes, his gaze locking onto the unyielding surface of the closed door.</p><p>Daniel suggested softly, &quot;Mr. Hawke, perhaps we should—&quot;</p><p>Julian fell silent for a moment, his gaze lingering on the door. Then, with a reluctant resolve, he prepared to turn away.</p><p>Just then, the door creaked open, a sliver of light spilling out.</p><p>A tousled head peeked through the gap, a pair of glistening eyes blinking up at them. Her voice, soft and sweet as a melody, broke the tension. &quot;Who is there?&quot;</p><p>At the sound of that innocent voice, Julian whipped around, his heart seizing in his chest.</p><p>There in the doorway stood Aurora reborn—her same delicate arch of brows, those luminous eyes fringed with impossibly long lashes. </p><p>But where Aurora had been vibrant, this child was faded—her hair dull straw, her collarbones sharp as knife-edges beneath threadbare pajamas.</p><p>Julian&#x27;s knees hit the hardwood with a crack. &quot;I&#x27;m—&quot; His voice shattered. He tried again, the words raw. &quot;I&#x27;m your daddy.&quot;</p><p>The girl recoiled, tiny fingers digging into the doorframe. Julian&#x27;s outstretched hands trembled in the space between them, afraid to touch, unable to pull back.</p><p>Slowly, so slowly, he lowered himself until their eyes were level. </p><p>When he spoke again, his voice was the softest it had been in years. &quot;Sweetheart, I&#x27;m your daddy. I&#x27;m here to take you home.&quot;</p><p>The girl tilted her head, studying Julian, her gaze flitting between the tear-streaked Julian before her and the tall figure of Daniel.</p><p>Her lashes fluttered, and her voice, clear and innocent, rang out. &quot;Daddy?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Julian replied, his heart swelling. &quot;I&#x27;m your daddy.&quot;</p><p>She had never imagined that her daddy would be this breathtakingly handsome, more striking, even, than the dazzling celebrities she had glimpsed on television.</p><p>And there was something in the aura he exuded that wrapped around her like a comforting embrace, stirring an instant fondness in her heart.</p><p>A tentative smile crept across her face. &quot;Daddy, you came to take me home?&quot;</p><p>Julian offered a loving smile, &quot;Yeah, sweetie. Daddy&#x27;s here to take you home.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Will Mommy be there too?&quot;</p><p>Her words struck Julian like a dagger, piercing straight through his heart. The searing agony threatened to shatter him all over again.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="199.html">« Prev</a><a href="201.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
