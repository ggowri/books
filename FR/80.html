I believe I heard someone shout Ms. Elvador's name. That's why I specifically ordered an investigation. The driver responsible for the accident was Ms. Elvador's childhood sweetheart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He has already been taken into police custody. However, since there were no casualties, he will likely face only a week of imprisonment and a revoked driver's license as punishment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawke, should we...take special care of him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian sat cross-legged at his desk,</span><span> his</span><span> fingers tapping lightly against the surface, producing crisp, rhythmic sounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan stood nearby, patiently awaiting his instructions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ensure the police charge him to the fullest extent of the law." Julian's voice was low and commanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan nodded. "Understood. I'll handle it immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go ahead." Julian waved a hand dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet just as Ethan reached the study door, Julian called out again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He halted, turning back with a hint of curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's mind drifted to Aurora&mdash;how Hubery had wronged her, costing her five years in prison, a leg, and a kidney.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Julian, mere imprisonment was far too lenient for Hubery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing Julian's darkening expression, Ethan cautiously asked, "Mr. Hawke, is there anything else?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Make sure he's thoroughly 'looked after.'" Julian's tone turned icy. "I don't want him leaving prison in one piece."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan grasped his meaning. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rest assured, Mr. Hawke. I'll ensure it's done flawlessly," Ethan replied before exiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian lit a cigarette.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a slow drag, the glowing tip flaring briefly. His eyes narrowed, a ruthless glint flashing in their depths. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smoke curled from his lips&mdash;first a tight swirl of white, then dissipating into the air, shrouding him in an aura of mystery and danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaning back in his chair, legs still elegantly crossed, he idly flicked ash with one hand while the other rested lazily on the armrest, exuding an air of casual indifference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish the cigarette, Ashley's voice floated through the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawke, lunch is ready."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Coming." Julian stubbed out the cigarette with practiced grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet he did not leave immediately. Instead, he opened the study window, letting fresh air dilute the lingering scent of smoke&mdash;Aurora's fragile health couldn't tolerate it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After straightening his clothes, he descended the stairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice, Ashley, and Daisy clustered around Aurora in the dining room, the atmosphere warm and serene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice held Aurora's hand as if she were her own granddaughter, her eyes brimming with affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, don't feel out of place. From today, this is your home. Ask for anything you'd like to eat&mdash;Ashley will make it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley emerged from the kitchen with a steaming plate of tomato and beef. "Ms. Elvador, I wasn't sure of your preferences, so I prepared a few of my specialties. Please try them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy chuckled, "Ashley, she loves tomato and beef!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? Then have more!" Beatrice ladled a generous portion into Aurora's plate, eyes eager. "Aurora, taste it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her twenty-three years</span><span> of life</span><span>, Aurora had never been treated with such tenderness. The feeling of being cherished left her both flustered and moved. Her eyes prickled with unshed tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Choking up, she murmured, "Madam Hawke, shouldn't we wait for Mr. Hawke?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice waved a hand. "Don't mind that rascal. Eat if you're hungry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian chuckled ruefully from the doorway, "Grandma, it seems I've fallen from your favor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice shot him a mock glare. "You finally decided to join us? I thought you'd skip lunch entirely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian had lingered to air out the smoke, mindful of Aurora's sensitivity. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My mistake," he conceded. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was m</span><span>oving to sit opposite Aurora, Beatrice yanked him down beside her instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian and Aurora locked eyes, momentarily speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright&mdash;let's eat!" Beatrice piled more food onto Aurora's plate, while Ashley and Daisy followed suit, soon creating a mountain on her dish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing Aurora's discomfort, Julian intervened. "Grandma, you'll burst her stomach." He transferred half her portions to his own plate. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora glanced at him in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian smiled faintly, "Still, eat more. You're too thin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice beamed. "Julian, you've finally learned to treat a lady properly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley and Daisy stifled giggles. Aurora's face flushed crimson as she focused on her meal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a lovely lunch</span><span>. Beatrice presided at the head of the table, Aurora at her side, Julian next to her. Ashley and Daisy sat across, radiating kindness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though overwhelmed by the attention, Aurora felt a deep, unfamiliar warmth&mdash;a sense of belonging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the most joyous meal she'd ever had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, Aurora rose to clear the dishes, but Ashley and Daisy stopped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Elvador, you're still recovering. We'll handle this," Ashley insisted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy nodded. "</span><span>Have some rest</span><span> in the living room."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later on, </span><span>Beatrice nudged Aurora toward Julian. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You </span><span>two</span><span> should bond," she said meaningfully before retreating to the kitchen with the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alone in the living room, Julian and Aurora sat on the sofa, the air tinged with unspoken tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian broke the silence, his voice softer than usual. "For your embroidery&mdash;tools and materials matter. I know a shop with high-quality threads in every color. Shall I take you later?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's eyes lit up. "Thank you, Mr. Hawke."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian smiled&mdash;a rare sight that softened his typically stern demeanor. Aurora found herself momentarily spellbound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the kitchen, Beatrice, Ashley, and Daisy peeked out, suppressing grins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look how well they suit each other," Beatrice whispered. "Julian's never been this attentive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ashley agreed, "He's so gentle around her&mdash;completely different from usual."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="79.html">« Prev</a><a href="81.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
