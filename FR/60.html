Her tear-streaked face, illuminated by the sunlight, was like a raw wound on display.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the angry man before her, she knew he had misunderstood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shook her head frantically, her fear so ingrained that even her lips trembled. "Adolph, let me explain, it's not what you think. It's Bertha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't listen to her explanation. He strode into the room and yanked Aurora away from Camille's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora, her fragile body no match for his strength, stumbled back and collided with a hard chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, she felt as though her bones were going to shatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could even react, a pair of strong hands gripped her shoulders, spinning her around to face him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes locked with a pair of deep, sorrow-filled ones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first fourteen years of her life, those eyes had been filled with warmth and tenderness. Now, they only reflected deep disappointment and anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's brow furrowed, his gaze like a storm raging in the distance. "Aurora, what happened to you? Are you still the innocent, kind girl you once were? Please, be the person you used to be."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staring into Hubery's familiar yet unfamiliar face, Aurora's tears spilled uncontrollably. Despair flooded her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't changed&mdash;he had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he would never admit it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her shoulders trembled, and her hands fell uselessly at her sides, as if all strength had been drained from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hubery..." Her voice was hoarse, filled with an endless sense of injustice and sorrow. But before she could say more, the emotions exploded within her, and she screamed, "I didn't do anything&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Hubery didn't believe her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did he not believe her, but his eyes were filled with contempt, as though he saw a madwoman trying to cover up her crimes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He released her shoulders with a look of disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, his treatment of her became even more brutal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A large hand grabbed her head and twisted it, forcing her to look at Camille, lifeless in the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett, his face twisted in fury, shouted, "We all saw it, and you still dare to deny it? If it wasn't for you, where did the bruises on Camille's neck come from? Aurora, you've become a monster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Camille was still conscious, and you couldn't wait to strangle her to silence her, is that it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's heart twisted in pain. How could his own sister be capable of such cruelty?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had once been enraged when she was bullied in prison, but now he saw it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was all a lie. Even when beaten and humiliated, Aurora hadn't changed her malicious ways.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps people like her should stay in a place as wicked as a prison, where they truly belonged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each word Barnett spoke was like a knife, plunging deep into Aurora's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body trembled violently as she desperately shook her head. "It wasn't me, really. I didn't do anything! It was Bertha. She's the one who strangled Camille..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice became more desperate, until it was almost a scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Adolph, Hubery, and Barnett remained glaring at her, their anger unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're still the same as you were five years ago, unrepentant," Adolph said, his tone cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five years ago, you pushed Camille down the stairs and framed Bertha for it. Five years later, you tried to strangle Camille again, planning to frame Bertha. The same tricks twice&mdash;do you really think we're fools?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, someone as vicious as you deserve to burn in hell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They spoke one after the other, condemning her without mercy, as they had done five years ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how she tried to explain or beg for understanding, no one believed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, it felt as though the world was spinning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, she felt as though she had traveled back to five years ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, it was the same. Her own brother, her childhood friend, her supposed fianc&eacute;&mdash;all of them stood in unison, tearing into her, wishing nothing more than to drown her with their hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five years later, though the time and place had changed, these same people still used the same cruel methods to accuse her of murder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice, witnessing the brutality toward her grandson's future wife and the false accusations being thrown at her, was livid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stormed forward, pushing Barnett's hand away as she placed herself in front of Aurora. "What's wrong with all of you? You're making baseless accusations!" Beatrice shouted. "It's that woman who tried to strangle the patient in the bed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pointed directly at Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley and Daisy, standing nearby, quickly chimed in, "Yeah, we saw it too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph, Hubery, and Barnett all turned to look at Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, no! It wasn't me! Aurora was the one who strangled Camille! I was only trying to protect her..." Bertha pleaded, her voice quivering with desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha's hair was a tangled mess, strands sticking to her face, drenched in tears, making her look disheveled and pathetic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blood streaks from Aurora's scratches stood out starkly against her tear-streaked face, amplifying her helpless, vulnerable appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sobbed, her body shaking as she cried out, "It wasn't me! Camille is my friend! How could I hurt her? It was Aurora who came in and attacked Camille. I tried to stop her, but she scratched me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She broke down in sobs again, her pitiful display pulling at the heartstrings of anyone who saw her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph's fury reached new heights, his eyes bloodshot. He spun around, grabbing Aurora by the neck and slamming her against the wall. "You're such a liar."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora felt as though her back had been struck by lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp pain spread through her body, and her head spun from the impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to breathe, her face turned purple as she gasped for air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she could barely focus on her own pain. Struggling to get a breath, she rasped, "Call the doctor. Please... Camille needs..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice was beyond furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At eighty years old, she had never seen such unreasonable and heartless people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder her grandson's future wife had tried to escape at all costs&mdash;she had been surrounded by such thoughtless, violent fools.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were her, she would have run too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fuming with both worry and anger, Beatrice swung her cane at Adolph's arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp blow made Adolph loosen his grip on Aurora's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seizing the opportunity, Beatrice yanked Aurora into her arms, holding her tightly. "If you don't get a doctor right now, the patient will truly be beyond saving."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph froze for a moment, shooting Aurora one last vicious glare before turning and storming out to find the doctor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora watched him leave, the realization finally hitting her&mdash;something was terribly wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With all the noise and chaos in the room, there was no way the doctors or nurses hadn't heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, not a single one had come to check on them. It was as if the entire floor was devoid of staff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way that could be true&mdash;unless the doctors and nurses had been sent away in advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze snapped to Bertha, and at that moment, she saw the smugness in her eyes.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="59.html">« Prev</a><a href="61.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
