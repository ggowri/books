Students milling about froze mid-step, their gazes glued to the striking quartet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my gosh. Look! That guy in the suit looks gorgeous! Is he a parent of a freshman?" a girl shouted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way," her friend shot back. "He looks like 30 tops. No chance he's a student's dad. Gotta be a new professor or something."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But he's hotter than our campus heartthrob! What does he teach? I'm signing up for his class!" another girl yelled, fanning herself dramatically.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora glanced around at the cluster of starry-eyed upperclassmen drooling over Benjamin and flicked her gaze to him, who stared straight ahead, radiating an icy "don't-even-think-about-it" aura. Then her eyes darted to her mom, who was rolling her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora fell silent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had to admit that if Benjamin ditched the sharp suit and threw on a hoodie, he could totally pass for a college student.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his razor-sharp jawline and movie-star looks, he was a walking heartbreaker, the kind of guy who could send a thousand girls swooning with a single glance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora tugged at his hand and said in a sweet tone, "Daddy."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That single word hit the crowd of fangirling coeds like a bucket of ice water.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They blinked, their jaws practically hitting the pavement as they gawked at Aurora. Then, as if to twist the knife, Aurora reached out with her other tiny hand and grabbed Laura's.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mommy."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They seemed to scream internally. </span><br><span>How could this gorgeous couple settle down and have kids so young? What a waste!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura, meanwhile, was in a flowing red dress that hugged her curves like it was painted on, her silver stilettos clicking with every confident step. Her aura screamed untouchable elegance, a breathtaking beauty who could stop traffic with a single glance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paired with Benjamin, the two of them were such a perfect match that it was no wonder they caused a riot on campus.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the family of four reached the registration desk.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Name?" the registrar asked and looked at Laura, clearly assuming she was the incoming freshman.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Honestly, who could blame the staff? Laura was more stunning than any superstar, and thanks to her flawless skincare routine, she looked twenty despite being well into her thirties.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura wore a dazzling smile. "Oh, no, I'm not the one registering. It's my daughter."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your daughter? How old are you, exactly, to have a daughter who's eighteen or nineteen?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The veiled compliment only made Laura's smile widen, her eyes sparkling with delight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, I don't have an eighteen-year-old daughter. But I do have a five-year-old."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she scooped Aurora into her arms, holding her up like a trophy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is my daughter. I'm here to help her register today."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every head in the vicinity swiveled toward Aurora, jaws dropping in unison.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Up until that moment, Benjamin and Laura's sheer star power had eclipsed the tiny girl in their orbit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, as the crowd took a closer look, whispers erupted like wildfire.</span><br><span>"Wait. Isn't she that girl? The one who went viral over the summer? The genius kid the news wouldn't shut up about?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the university, the name "Aurora" was whispered in reverence across every corner because this five-year-old child prodigy had single-handedly rewritten the university's history books by becoming its youngest-ever freshman.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my God, it is her! The top scorer! The prodigy!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's even cuter in person than in those videos!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is her little brain that brilliant? It's unreal!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I finally get what people mean by 'genius is just the starting line.' Like, we're all top achievers to even get into this school, but she's five and breezed through the entrance exam!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air buzzed with awe and excitement. The registrar, hands trembling slightly, could barely contain her enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Aurora stayed on her current path, with a mind like hers, she would undoubtedly grow up to be a pillar of the nation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She might even get scooped up by the higher-ups straight out of graduation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had struck gold with this true diamond in the rough.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's arrival caused an uproar, but eventually, after the registration chaos settled, the family managed to slip away from the campus.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They grabbed lunch at a cozy spot just outside the university, but the meal was tinged with bittersweet tension because Benjamin and William would soon have to leave.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William clung to Aurora, wrapping his arms tightly around her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, I don't wanna leave you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora hugged him back just as fiercely. "I'll miss you so much, William."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William pulled back just enough to look into her eyes and promised, "Don't worry, Aurora. I'll come visit you during every break. I swear."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The family lingered in their tearful goodbyes until finally, Benjamin gently pried William away, and the two of them departed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From that day forward, Laura officially became Aurora's full-time companion, dedicated to her daughter's new chapter at the university.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every morning, Laura walked Aurora to school, and every afternoon, she was there to pick Aurora up, even though their home was a mere 1500 feet from campus.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Aurora, this simple routine was nothing short of a miracle. In her past life, such care had been an unreachable dream.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, living with the Elvador family, she had had to drag herself out of bed at four in the morning, enduring a grueling two-hour commute just to get to school.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At lunch, there was no going home for a meal because she had been stuck at school, and by the time she got back in the evening, all that awaited her were cold leftovers.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, she had parents who adored her and a mother who personally walked her to school, picked her up, and cooked delicious meals.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These ordinary days were the kind of luxury her past self could only have fantasized about.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now that she had them, she cherished every second.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin and William made the trip to see Aurora and Laura every Friday evening, staying through Sunday night before heading back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This rhythm became their new normal, and in the blink of an eye, four years passed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During those four years, Aurora only returned to Putnam during winter and summer breaks, reuniting with Julian, Joe, Oliver, and Dora.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though their time together was limited, they never treated her as an outsider.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how stellar her grades were or how dazzling her genius was, to them, she was always their cuddly little sister.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as all good things do, those golden days came to an abrupt end on the day of her graduation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the past four years, Aurora's brilliance had shone brighter than ever. She had swept up every scholarship the university offered and claimed first place in every competition she entered. Even before she graduated, whispers of her talent had reached across borders, and Aconoma, the behemoth of global economies, came knocking with an offer too tempting for most to refuse.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Aconoma government had done their homework. Aurora's abilities were undeniable. Given that she was still a minor, her worldview was not yet fully formed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They saw an opportunity. If they could lure her away to mold her under their education system and win her loyalty, she would be theirs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A prodigy like her could generate unimaginable value over the decades to come.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her intellect, she might even invent groundbreaking weapons, solidifying its global dominance for generations.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their determination to poach her was fierce, sparing no expense.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they had miscalculated badly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Putnam, the Barron family reigned as a pillar of the four great clans. Their financial might wasn't just abundant but so deeply ingrained that counting their fortune became a futile exercise.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Money could fix ninety-nine percent of all troubles. The Barron family could provide Aurora with anything she could possibly want.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, no matter how lavish the offers provided by Aconoma grew, Aurora remained unmoved.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a daughter of Peloland, raised and nurtured by her homeland, and every ounce of her talent would be devoted to its growth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, the Elvador family had crushed her dream of attending university.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, she treasured every moment of her college chance like it was oxygen. Consequently, during her studies, she poured in effort that eclipsed the ordinary.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A genius mind paired with relentless hard work made her academic performance a steamroller across campus, leaving her peers in the dust as they struggled to even comprehend the heights she effortlessly reached.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, she harbored a daring hypothesis, one rooted in the mystery of her rebirth.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="226.html">« Prev</a><a href="228.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
