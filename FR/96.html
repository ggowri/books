Who did he think he was?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon had never met such a classless man before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Aurora could speak, Simon put his hand on his hip and snapped, "Are you blind? She pulled Aurora's hair so hard that she nearly ripped her scalp off! Didn't you see that? You're defending her without knowing what happened and demanding Aurora apologize! That's completely insane!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph looked at Simon contemptuously, clearly disgusted by his effeminate manner. "This is between Aurora and me. Keep your nose out of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he turned his attention back to Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze was predatory as his cold eyes locked onto her as if she were his possession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His thin lips parted as he spoke cruelly, "This isn't the first time you've bullied Bertha, Aurora. Don't play innocent with me. I know exactly what kind of person you are.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you apologize to Bertha, I'll pretend this never happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you refuse, I have ways to make you pay for it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora just stared at him blankly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His misunderstanding and threats didn't hurt her anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After being constantly misunderstood and humiliated by the Elvador family and Adolph, she had become bulletproof, immune to their poison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't care less about Adolph's attitude toward her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five years had passed since the days when that young boy used to chase after her, competing together and repeatedly declaring he would surpass her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he had transformed into someone she found utterly repulsive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it didn't matter. She had stopped caring long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Aurora had grown accustomed to was something Simon couldn't stand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch your mouth! If you don't know how to talk, just shut your trap," Simon snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you blind or something? Which of your damn eyes saw Aurora bullying her? And where exactly did you see Aurora putting on an act?" Simon's voice dripped with sarcasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon rolled his sleeves, ready to charge at Adolph, but Aurora held him back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Simon, Grandmother's birthday celebration is about to start. Let's go. There's no point getting worked up over someone who doesn't matter," Aurora said coolly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph felt like he was choking, the words stuck in his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he just someone who doesn't matter to Aurora?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her indifference infuriated him. He wanted to shatter that calm facade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would take anything from her, anger, tears, pain, anything but this cold indifference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Aurora turned to leave, a firm hand seized her arm. With one swift pull, she stumbled and slammed against the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She let out a pained groan as the gift box slipped from her arms, spilling the embroidery onto the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph pinned Aurora against the wall and demanded in an icy voice, "Apologies to Bertha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora hated his closeness and pushed against him with all her might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his body was like a brick wall, no matter how hard she pushed, he wouldn't budge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon had enough. He rushed over and shoved Adolph away from Aurora, shouting, "Like hell she'll apologize, you stupid jerk!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph's face darkened as he kicked Simon hard in the stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon collapsed to the ground, clutching his stomach in agony, unable to get back up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora watched in horror and rage, but before she could help Simon, she spotted Bertha picking up the embroidery from the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes narrowed at the sight. Without hesitation, Aurora lunged for the embroidery, but Bertha managed to dodge her grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the last straw. Aurora's anger exploded as she whirled around and slapped Bertha hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The unexpected slap left Bertha standing there in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bright red handprint appeared on her cheek, and blood trickled from the corner of her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha stared at Aurora in disbelief, thinking Aurora wouldn't dare lay a hand on her with Adolph present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha was screaming inside, wishing she could tear Aurora apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she couldn't show her true colors in front of Adolph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears started streaming down her face as she sobbed dramatically, "Aurora, why did you hit me? I was trying to help by picking up your things."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph's face turned frighteningly dark as he glared at Aurora with gritted teeth, "Aurora, you've gone too far!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora seemed utterly deaf to his words, her eyes locked on the embroidery in Bertha's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stepped forward, her voice ice-cold. "Give it back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha could tell how much the item meant to Aurora, and she guessed it was probably a gift for Beatrice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That made her even more determined not to return it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Where Adolph couldn't see, she dug her long nails into the embroidery while shooting challenging looks at Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's anger exploded when she saw how Bertha's nails destroyed the embroidery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lost all control and lunged at Bertha, ready for a fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha screamed with fake tears, "Adolph, help me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph thought Aurora had utterly lost it as he grabbed her arm and forcefully pulled her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora shouted, "Let go of me, you bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her struggles, Aurora couldn't break free as Adolph dragged her into a nearby private room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>BANG!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door slammed shut as Adolph pinned Aurora against it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you lost your damn mind?" Adolph growled, his face inches from hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was deep and intimidating as he towered over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was shaking with rage, her chest heaving as she glared at him with burning eyes. "Get your hands off me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph tightened his grip on her wrists, his eyes flashing a warning. "What the hell are you trying to pull?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Aurora's breathing steadied, her expression turned ice-cold and determined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lifted her chin, meeting his gaze head-on. "Funny, I should be asking you the same thing, Adolph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I spent five years in prison for a crime I didn't commit. You destroyed my education, my health, my future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at what I've become; I'm barely human anymore. This is all because of you and the Elvador family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What right do you have to question my actions?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All I want is to stay far away from you people. Is that too much to ask?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flicker of pain crossed Adolph's eyes as his gaze wavered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora caught his expression and let out a bitter laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! You clipped my wings and forced me to crawl in the mud when I could have soared through the skies. I've been asking myself why! What terrible sin I committed to deserve such persecution from all of you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I couldn't figure it out before, but now I get it! My excellence was my crime in your eyes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph's pupils constricted as the color drained from his face. A flash of panic crossed his eyes before his expression turned cold again. "Aurora, stop talking nonsense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You had the guts to do it but not to admit it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You couldn't handle that I was better than you. That's why you rushed to tear me down, belittle me, and manipulate me! You tried to make me believe I was worthless and incompetent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough!" Adolph roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was past the point of caring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why should I stay quiet about your dirty tricks?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora pressed on relentlessly. "Adolph, you're nothing but a selfish, small-minded man who ruined my life because you were jealous of my talent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words echoed through the private room, each syllable cutting into Adolph's heart like a knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph's face flushed red and white as Aurora's cutting words struck him to the core, and his emotional walls crumbled as he stared at her anger-flushed face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, he admitted it to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had deliberately tried to clip her wings, desperate to dim her brilliant light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed that she would belong to him only if she remained ordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his twisted logic, only if she became an average person would he be worthy of her, able to keep her by his side, and ensure she'd stay home after marriage as a devoted wife and mother, forever trapped within his sphere of influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last thing he wanted was for her to become the exceptional talent her teachers saw in her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his darkest thoughts exposed, Adolph desperately tried to silence her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly bent down and forcefully pressed his lips against Aurora's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Adolph's kiss swallowed all of Aurora's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His kiss was wild and dominating, trying to convey years of guilt, longing, and frustration to Aurora through this desperate act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything he had done was for her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aurora's mind went blank from his sudden move, and she stared at him with wide eyes full of disbelief.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="95.html">« Prev</a><a href="97.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
