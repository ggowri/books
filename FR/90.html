She stumbled, barely catching herself on the desk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did she realize she had pulled an all-nighter, and her body was completely exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The morning sunlight filtered through the half-drawn curtains, casting a soft glow on Aurora's pale face, giving her features a gentle golden sheen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She squinted at the warm light, feeling it chase away some of her exhaustion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stretched her arms wide, and her joints crackled in protest of the long night's work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She carefully rolled up the embroidered fabric and placed it in the prepared gift box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian specially chose the box, as its intricate carved patterns perfectly complement the "The Garden."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She spotted a tall man in a black suit as she stepped out with the gift box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora thought it was Julian, but when the man turned around, she was surprised to see Ethan instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bright smile lit up Ethan's face when he saw Aurora. "Thank you for your hard work, Ms. Elvador."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora blinked in surprise. "Ethan? What brings you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He strode forward and took the gift box from her hands, carefully placing it on a nearby table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He explained, "Since we weren't sure when you'd finish the embroidery, Mr. Hawke has already escorted Madam Hawke to the banquet hall."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora nodded in understanding. After all, Beatrice's birthday celebration couldn't begin without the guest of honor present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at the wall clock in the living room. It was already ten o'clock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ethan, would you mind waiting a moment? I want to freshen up first," she said apologetically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew she must look exhausted, and it wouldn't be appropriate to show up at Beatrice's party in this state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her surprise, Ethan snapped his fingers, and a team of people carrying makeup cases walked in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Ms. Elvador. Mr. Hawke has already arranged for stylists to help you get ready. They'll have you looking perfect in thirty minutes. There is plenty of time</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>T</span><span>he party starts at eleven."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to the lead stylist and said, "Simon, Ms. Elvador is in your capable hands."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon Russell, the male stylist, was dressed rather flamboyantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He crossed his arms with a limp wrist and looked Aurora up and down with a sneer. "I just can't understand how someone as masculine as Julian could fall for such a plain Jane like you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was left speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pursed his lips and continued, "Not only is your skin dry as a desert, but you look worn out. Oh my god! Look at those chapped lips! I swear I've got more sass than you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's eye twitched as he coldly interjected, "Simon, if you don't want this job, just say so."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, fine, I'll shut up!" Simon rolled his eyes dramatically at Aurora, treating her like she was his love rival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora gave Ethan a questioning look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan shot her a reassuring glance and mouthed silently, "Don't worry! He's hostile to any woman who gets close to Mr. Hawke. It's not just you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora instantly understood the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She flashed Simon a bright smile and said, "Thank you in advance for your help, Simon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, Simon began directing the makeup artist to work on Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First, Simon gently wiped Aurora's face with a cotton pad, evening out her dull complexion from pulling an all-nighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then applied foundation with a makeup sponge, dabbing it lightly across her face. The thin layer perfectly concealed her dark circles and signs of exhaustion, making her skin look smooth and flawless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moving on, he picked up an eyebrow pencil to define Aurora's brows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her natural brows were already delicate and perfect, so he only made slight enhancements to add a touch of sophistication.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using an eyeshadow brush, he swept a light pink shade across her eyelids, then blended a deep brown at the outer corners to create a soft look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's eyes instantly came alive with a precise line of eyeliner and several coats of mascara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon chose a subtle peach-pink blush for her cheeks, applying it just above her cheekbones to give her a gentle, feminine flush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The final touch was a moisturizing rose-pink lipstick that made her lips look full and dewy, like honey ready to drip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon stepped back and nodded with satisfaction at his work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, with a graceful swing of his hips, he ran his fingers along a rack of gorgeous dresses before pulling out a pale pink gown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A fresh, youthful look suits a young lady best," he said, admiring the floor-length dress with its delicate chiffon layers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Aurora put on the dress, she looked elegant and vibrant, contrasting her usual worn-down appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon styled Aurora's hair in a low, elegant bun, letting a few loose strands frame her face. Adding a delicate pearl necklace, she transformed into an ethereal beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora could hardly recognize herself in the mirror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had almost forgotten how vibrant and cheerful she used to be before returning to the Elvador family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing herself looking so beautiful, fresh, and full of youth again was amazing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon stepped back with pride to admire his work. "I've done it again! I can turn anyone into a masterpiece!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora just sighed silently, used to Simon's sharp tongue by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan couldn't help but exclaim from the side, "Ms. Elvador, you look stunning today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't wait to see Julian's face when he saw Aurora looking like an angel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The truth was that Aurora had always been beautiful. Still, the hardships she'd endured had left her radiating insecurity from within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when Beatrice showed her kindness, Aurora's face would betray her feelings of unworthiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such an inferiority complex would have annoyed Ethan if he had seen it in anyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after learning about Aurora's life story, his heart ached for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was wonderful, yet life had never given her a fair chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thank goodness she had met Beatrice and Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan was sure that from now on, Aurora's life would only get better and better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's expression grew sincere as he looked at Aurora</span><span>, He</span><span> ma</span><span>de</span><span> a gentlemanly gesture to allow her to proceed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's heart melted at his respectful demeanor and obvious pleasure in serving her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes welled up with tears of happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything felt perfect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She realized that good people always surrounded themselves with equally kind souls, unlike the Elvador family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua, Celeste, and Barnett despised her, and their servants followed suit, looking at her with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Bertha's driver treated her with mockery as if to say she was nothing but dirt compared to Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora took a deep breath, raised her head, and walked gracefully toward the luxury car waiting outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan immediately bent down to carry the train of her dress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver, Daniel Jenkins, was already waiting by the car in his white gloves. He opened the door for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thoughtfully shielded her head with his other hand as she got in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon stood at the mansion's entrance, watching enviously as Aurora was treated like royalty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Lucky girl," he muttered under his breath.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="89.html">« Prev</a><a href="91.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
