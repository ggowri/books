"Oh, do thank your manager for me," she purred, laying it on thick like butter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The waitress flashed a polished, professional smile. "</span><span>Sure</span><span>. It's our pleasure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she wheeled the empty cart out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the door clicked shut, the crowd turned their envious eyes on Stella, rushing over to shower her with compliments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Gavin, humiliated from being slapped, was fuming. His chubby face twisted in rage as he grabbed a plate from the table and hurled it straight at Aurora's head, cursing furiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You ungrateful little wretch! How dare you hit me? I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora reacted fast. She snatched a fork from the table, ready to defend herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could strike, Daisy threw herself in front of her, shielding her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp "crack" rang out as the plate smashed against Daisy's head, shattering into pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daisy!" Aurora cried out in panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. </span><span>Elvador</span><span>, I'm fine. Go get Mr. Hawke," Daisy said, wincing through the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words sparked another round of mocking laughter from the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two seriously think you know Mr. Hawke? Do you even know who he is? The guy's </span><span>Peloland</span><span> royalty. He's been in Orley six months, dropped tens of billions of dollars on that eastside land, and now he's the richest man around. And you </span><span>idiot</span><span>s think you're on his radar?" one of them jeered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're dying to meet him, stick around. When James gets here, kiss his boots real nice. Maybe if he's in a good mood, he'll let you catch a glimpse of Mr. Hawke from a mile away," another added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James is a big deal now. No way he'd waste his time on trash like her," someone else sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trash like who?" a voice cut in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door swung open again, and a guy in a white plaid suit strolled in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James Miller </span><span>was</span><span> the golden boy of their high school class. He was undeniably handsome, more so than any other man in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that pretty face was all he had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five years was a long time since those glory days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd been a cocky one back then, but at least his eyes were clean&mdash;hadn't been tainted by all the world's BS yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now? After getting knocked around by the real world, those eyes were razor-sharp with naked ambition. He carried himself like someone who'd finally gotten their first hit of power and couldn't get enough of the high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James! You're finally here!" the crowd cheered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They swarmed him, piling on the flattery like eager puppies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James waved them off with a casual, "Oh, you guys are too much," but his smug grin and sky-high chin told a different story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What took you so long, James? We've been waiting forever!" someone whined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smirked, oozing confidence. "</span><span>J</span><span>ust hashing out some business with Mr. Hawke."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was half-true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He</span><span> was</span><span> with Julian</span><span> earlier</span><span>, but "business" was a stretch. He'd mostly been fetching coffee and hovering like a lackey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he heard Julian was at Grand Hotel, </span><span>he</span><span> shamelessly tagged along to see him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian had been gearing up to discuss the East Suburb project with someone and brushed him off without a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was heading to Room 107 when he spotted a waitress with an empty cart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tossed out a casual question. "Are my guests all here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd replied politely, "Sir, are your friends a group of young people in their twenties, including a Ms. Walker?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James nodded eagerly. "Yep, that's them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're in Room 101, sir."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James blinked, thrown off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I'd booked 107, not some 101.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What's with this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not 107?"</span><span> he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The waitress clarified, "No, sir. Mr. Hawke reserved 101. Your friends are already there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was riding high, feeling like he'd hit the jackpot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He figured Julian must think pretty highly of him to book the Grand Hotel's VIP suite for his reunion, just to make him look good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd thought Julian didn't even know he existed, but now he felt like he mattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a shred of doubt, James strutted into Room 101, beaming as he spotted his old classmates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their praise sent him soaring, his ego ballooning by the second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, alright, since we're all here, let's sit," he said, waving a hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone scrambled to their seats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then James' eyes landed on Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was his high school crush, the goddess he'd pursued relentlessly but never won over. He'd tried everything back then, but nothing swayed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The one you couldn't have always shone the brightest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was married now, but that didn't stop him from keeping his options open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, he was already plotting his divorce. He wanted to bleed his wife dry, leave her with nothing, and walk away with every penny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had made up his mind that once he got her money, he would indulge himself in luxury, drowning in pleasure every single day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, looking at Aurora, he found himself drawn to her even more than before. She was even more beautiful than she had been in high school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Guess my taste hasn't changed a bit. Still hooked on girls like her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a quick rise, he'd married a rich heiress, who was the only child in her family, but he despised her. Sleeping with her felt like cuddling a hog.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone could see the raw hunger in James' stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, you showed up uninvited. </span><span>So</span><span> admit it. You're here for James. Now that he's here, go say hi already," someone prodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora hated the way James looked at her. It was like he was stripping her </span><span>bare with</span><span> his eyes, and it made her skin crawl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She frowned, "James, are you sure you booked Room 101?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised an eyebrow, brimming with swagger. "Of course I did. You think I'd forget my own reservation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora went quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now she wondered if Julian had mixed things up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Either way, she had to get out of there fast and find Julian to sort this mess out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She grabbed Daisy's arm and headed for the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the crowd blocked the exit, refusing to budge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're here now, so don't run off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's this? Playing innocent again? I can't stand that fake act of yours</span><span> anymore</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cut it out already. </span><span>I</span><span>t's just pathetic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone shoved Aurora hard from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught off guard, she stumbled forward, tumbling straight into James' arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"See? Told you she came here to throw herself at James," a voice crowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tsk, tsk, all of us watching, and she's not even embarrassed. Shameless, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She wouldn't give James the time of day in high school. Now that he's loaded, she's all over him. How disgusting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ease up. If James likes her, he can have some fun with her. She's practically begging for it, so why let that go to waste?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fair point. With a criminal record, finding a job must be tough. Maybe selling her body is the only option left."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their words cut deep, vicious, and crude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy trembled with fury. "Shut up! Ms. </span><span>Elvador's</span><span> nothing like that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. </span><span>Elvador</span><span>? Ha! More like a call girl," someone shot back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora squirmed, trying to break free from James' grip, but he held her tight, his arms like a vice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was his first time holding her, and she felt so soft against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her scent hit him like a drug&mdash;intoxicating and irresistible&mdash;sparking an instant reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora noticed the change in him and almost gagged, her stomach twisting with revulsion.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="176.html">« Prev</a><a href="178.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
