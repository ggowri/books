She shook like a leaf. "Stop it, you're insane! Samuel's still out there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan paused for a moment, taking in the hot mess beneath him - flushed cheeks, heavy breathing, the works.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lips twisted into a mean smirk. "Perfect. If he wants a show, let's give him one. Maybe he'll stop sniffing around you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You might not care about dignity, but I do!" Lily hissed through clenched teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan laughed, voice dripping sarcasm. "What's wrong? Scared?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fingers grazed her cheek, trailing down to linger on her delicate collarbone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The touch sent electricity racing through her skin. Her face burned, the flush spreading everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her blushing, flustered state had Ethan smirking like the cat who ate the canary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Want it now?" he teased, raising an eyebrow with a wicked grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's blood boiled. Sure, Ethan looked like Mr. Perfect on the outside, but underneath? Total dirtbag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Cut the crap</span><span>, Ethan!" she snapped through clenched teeth. "I'm not a guy, so why are you so obsessed with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words threw him off, confusion flickering across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, you're not a guy. If you were, I wouldn't be </span><span>like this</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily shot him a skeptical look. "Oh, please. I saw you hugging some dude last time. You two were all cozy. Don't tell me you're not gay. Or what, you swing both ways?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if she had just uncovered some shocking truth, she cursed. "Damn it! Let go of me! </span><span>I'm not </span><span>gonna</span><span> be your bi-curious experiment!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan nearly burst out laughing at her wild </span><span>nonsense</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We</span><span> had sex</span><span>, and you still can't tell I'm straight?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Guess I didn't try hard enough last night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about we give it a go right here?" With that, his searing hand slipped under her skirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's eyes widened in alarm. She grabbed his wrist, </span><span>voice shaky</span><span>. "Don't</span><span> you dare</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right then, Samuel - still wobbly from getting his ass handed to him - staggered up and started hammering on the window like a maniac. "Get your fucking hands off her, Ethan!" he roared, voice cracking. "Touch her and I'll fucking end you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan halted. Ignoring Samuel, he turned to Lily. "Not into it here? Fine, we'll take it home and pick up where we left off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift tug, he yanked off his tie and bound her wrists in a few deft moves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Play nice," he growled in her ear, voice dark with promise, "or I'll take you right here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily turned away, dodging that cocky-ass grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Shit. I'd hooked up with a psycho who wouldn't quit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan patted her head gently. "</span><span>Good girl.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled back and shoved the car door open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel's eyes were bloodshot as he rushed forward, his fists clenched. "What the hell did you do to Lily?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan </span><span>shot him a look of pure disgust</span><span>. "</span><span>What I do with my girl </span><span>ain't</span><span> your business.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words struck Samuel like a slap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He </span><span>lunged,</span><span> fist raised to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's cold gaze stopped him in his tracks. His voice carried a deadly chill. "Didn't get enough of a beating earlier?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel froze, his body stiff with suppressed rage, as he watched Ethan climb back into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car purred to life, kicking up a plume of exhaust before speeding off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily shifted, sitting up straighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take me back to campus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Nah, w</span><span>e're going home to finish what we started," Ethan s</span><span>mirk</span><span>ed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily clenched her fists. She was furious, but there was nothing she could do about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the meal, </span><span>Daisy was safely home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora strolled alongside Julian under the dim streetlights, savoring the rare moment of peace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They walked in comfortable silence until they hit the bridge. Aurora stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A soft breeze played with her hair as she leaned on the railing, watching the dark water below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart felt lighter than the last time she'd been here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, she'd been ready to end it all, one step from jumping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawke, </span><span>look at </span><span>this place</span><span>.</span><span>" Her eyes shimmered with emotion. "If I hadn't run into you here that day, I'd probably be gone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Julian, her expression earnest. "I mean it. Thank you. You're the greatest gift life's given me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's stern features softened. "</span><span>Still remember what I told you that day</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora thought for a moment. "You said </span><span>life's</span><span> like a play. Sometimes, an extra audience member changes the whole story. You wanted to see what would happen if I didn't end it then and there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She paused, then continued, "I didn't buy it at the time. I thought my story was already ruined beyond repair."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint smile warmed Julian's rugged face, glowing softly in the night. "Oh, I wouldn't say that. The best parts often come at the end. You've made it through the worst. Now, you can savor the good life ahead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora nodded. "You're right. Thank you for pulling me back from the brink, Mr. Hawke."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her smile radiated gratitude, but a dull ache throbbed in her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She longed for a healthy body more than anything. But the truth was, her time was running out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She dipped her head, hiding the sorrow welling up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian, sharp as ever, caught her mood drop. He was about to say something to cheer her up when a jarring voice cut through the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She snapped her head up, locking eyes with Hubery's delighted gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gone was the disheveled beggar who'd once scavenged through trash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he sat in a wheelchair, clad in a sharp black suit, a blanket draped over his lap. His hands rested on the blanket, clutching a file folder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hair was slicked back, and he practically glowed with renewed vigor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's eyes narrowed at the sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't believe that Hubery, jobless and crippled,</span><span> </span><span>somehow clawed his way back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's stare fixed on Aurora, brimming with possessive intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, you have no idea how hard I've been looking for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's mood soured instantly. Her rare, peaceful evening with Julian was now completely ruined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This outing with him was precious, and running into the last person she wanted to see spoiled everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring Hubery, she grabbed Julian's hand and turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Hubery wheeled himself forward, blocking her path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, aren't you happy to see me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She let out a bitter laugh. "Happy? Hubery, you framed me for Bertha and got me locked up for five years. I can barely stand the sight of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's face twisted slightly, but he quickly regained his composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, that's all in the past. And back then, I didn't know the truth, which is why I wronged you. We grew up together, so you should know how I feel about you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly," she shot back, her voice dripping with scorn. "It's exactly because we grew up together that it took me so long to see through your hypocrisy. Otherwise, I would never have wasted a single cent on you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her relentless jabs twisted Hubery's calm expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he'd regained some of his old polish, the trials he'd endured had warped him inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze shifted to Julian, who stood tall and composed beside Aurora. </span><span>Then</span><span> he spat, "You won't take me back because of him, huh?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, since when did you get so loose? Last time, some guy was dragging you to the hospital for a pregnancy test. How long's it been since then, and now you've got a new man? What's the plan? </span><span>Are you </span><span>gonna</span><span> ditch the kid, dump that guy, and trade up for someone better?</span><span>"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="172.html">« Prev</a><a href="174.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
