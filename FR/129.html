A chilling coldness, like being thrown into the depths of an icy wasteland, spread to every inch of his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lips parted slightly, but he couldn't utter a complete syllable. His bloodshot eyes, filled with sadness, locked onto Aurora with such intensity it seemed like he wanted to burn her with his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you... you shameless woman!" He struggled to force these words through gritted teeth, his voice thick with resentment and unwillingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he lost control, launching into a hysterical tirade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you even realize that a woman's purity is her greatest fortune? You're not even married, and you're already carrying the man's child. Aren't you afraid his family will use this child to manipulate you for the rest of your life?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, you've disappointed me. So reckless and indecent. Even if you get rid of the child, I will never want you again. Your once carried another man's child. Unworthy of me, let alone being my child&rsquo;s mother!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You disgust me! Make me sick to my stomach!" As he spoke, he grimaced in repulsion, his face contorting into an expression so twisted it was nearly grotesque.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora watched him coldly, her gaze devoid of emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Hubery</span><span>, how did I miss how outdated your thinking is? If I didn't know you had a degree, I'd think you were never educated."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Had I known you could graduate yet still not tell right from wrong, I wouldn't have funded your education. I ended up raising an ungrateful wretch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words sent a violent tremor through </span><span>Hubery's</span><span> body. His eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean by that? Funded me?" His voice shot up in pitch as if trying to drown out his panic and fear. But the slight tremble betrayed his growing unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's expression remained indifferent. She stared straight into </span><span>Hubery's</span><span> eyes and enunciated each word clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I funded your whole college education."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her statement was short and direct, yet it struck </span><span>Hubery</span><span> like a bombshell, shaking him to his core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impossible!" </span><span>Hubery</span><span> blurted out instantly, shaking his head violently. He was desperately resisting this cruel truth. He couldn't accept that all his pride and accomplishments had been propped up by Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why not?" Aurora stepped up. "All those fancy clothes and luxury items, came from where? Every cent was my hard work. I juggled part-time jobs, entered contests, and earned scholarships so you could focus on studying without worrying about cash."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you? You used that money to dress yourself up like a wealthy heir, deceiving everyone, including me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's</span><span> body slumped into his wheelchair. His mind reeled as he recalled those days when he strutted around in designer brands, basking in admiration. He had always believed his charm and ability had earned him that recognition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, it felt like a slap, one after another, until his pride was shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No... This isn't true. You're lying..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery</span><span> shouted at Aurora, "You were just a high school student! How could you have possibly afforded to give me 10 thousand dollars a month?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't think I don't know who really funded me. It was Bertha! Only a wealthy heiress wouldn't care about a mere 10 thousand dollars. You were never valued by the </span><span>Elvador</span><span> family. They never gave you a single cent, where would you have gotten the money?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he had always known how hard her life was in the </span><span>Elvador</span><span> family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, when she suffered under their cruelty, he merely brushed her off with a dismissive remark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew the </span><span>Elvador</span><span> family never gave her a dime, yet when he had a steady 10 thousand dollars each month, he never once thought to give even a fraction to help her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How foolish had she been to pour every cent into him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deep sorrow rose in Aurora's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She spoke coldly, "You never entered competitions, you wouldn't know that winning first place in a physics contest comes with a generous prize."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I regret it now. I regret giving you all my prize money. If I had kept it for myself, my life would have been much easier. And no one knows that better than you, Mr. Winston, a man who walked around in designer brands all through college."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was calm but sharp, each word cutting into </span><span>Hubery's</span><span> ego like a knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I don't believe you! You're lying..." </span><span>Hubery</span><span> continued to struggle in denial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had no interest in wasting another second on this irrational man. Her expression remained serene as she said dismissively, "Yes, yes, I'm lying to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, without hesitation, she turned and left with Daniel, not bothering to argue further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her indifferent attitude provoked him, fueling his anger even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperate, he pushed his wheelchair forward, the wheels screeching sharply against the floor as he tried to chase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, stop! Don't you dare leave! Explain yourself!" he </span><span>screamed,</span><span> his voice hoarse. But Aurora didn't hear him, or rather, she didn't care to listen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Aurora and Daniel got into the car. The engine roared to life, and they drove away from the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery</span><span> watched the car disappear into the distance. His body slumped into his wheelchair, his gaze hollow and dazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kept mumbling, "Impossible... Impossible..." But deep down, he had already accepted the painful truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had come to the hospital for a follow-up on his leg injury. But now, Aurora's words consumed his thoughts, leaving no room for concern about his legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, all he wanted was to find Bertha and get the truth out of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha, the heiress of the </span><span>Elvador</span><span> family, had made a shocking scene at Beatrice's banquet. She had attempted to steal a twenty-million-dollar embroidery piece and was caught red-handed and taken away by the police on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire banquet hall had witnessed the incident. That same night, the news was plastered across every major headline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery</span><span> had seen the reports too. He knew that Bertha was now in custody.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The detention center was dimly lit, the air heavy with tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Separated by cold, rigid iron bars, </span><span>Hubery</span><span> sat face-to-face with Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never imagined that the once-proud Bertha would end up in such a miserable state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her head had been shaved, her scalp scarred from large patches of damaged skin, leaving behind marks where hair would never grow again. The contrast between these bald spots and the sparse new growth made her ridiculous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her pride and arrogance had long vanished without a trace. Now, she was nothing but a pathetic and fallen figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she saw </span><span>Hubery</span><span>, her eyes lit up with a glimmer of hope, believing that the esteemed lawyer might be her ticket to freedom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the moment she noticed the wheelchair he sat in, the wrinkles on his disheveled clothing, and the exhaustion etched into his face, that hope died instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, </span><span>Hubery</span><span> was the first person to visit her. Even knowing he was struggling himself, she forced a pitiful expression, pleading, "</span><span>Hubery</span><span>, please save me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, when Bertha, as pristine and elegant as a flower, put on a pitiful act, she truly appeared delicate and sorrowful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, her hair gone, a bizarre hairstyle, dull skin, and a haggard appearance, she was nothing like the woman she used to be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was nothing left in her to stir even a shred of sympathy from </span><span>Hubery</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gripping the iron bars tightly, </span><span>Hubery</span><span> glared at Bertha and demanded, "Bertha, tell me the truth. Who funded my education?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha hadn't expected him to come for this. She felt awkward, but in the next second, she steadied herself, maintaining a composed expression as she lied without hesitation. "Of course, it was me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough with the act!" </span><span>Hubery</span><span> roared. "Aurora told me the truth. You lied to me! Why did you do it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes burned with fury as if he wanted to rip the truth out of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He already found out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha's heart clenched as she met </span><span>Hubery's</span><span> murderous glare. She knew there was no point in keeping up the pretense any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she let out a sharp laugh, a twisted mixture of madness and satisfaction. "It took you five whole years to figure it out? You really are an idiot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right! Aurora funded you. Can you believe how stupid she was? She gave you all her money anonymously, while she herself could barely afford to eat or stay warm. She had no idea you were using her money to buy designer brands and show off at school."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Bertha thought about Aurora's suffering over the years, the more she laughed, rocking back and forth with amusement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know how joyful I was every time I watched you buy me gifts and try to win my favor?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, that wretched woman, how dare she think she could compare to me? She was abandoned by her own parents, betrayed by her brother, and discarded by her childhood sweetheart. It was all exactly what she deserved! Why should she have been born into a wealthy family while I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice suddenly caught in her throat, her eyes flashing with hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because she was nothing more than the daughter of a doctor and a chauffeur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stealing Aurora's life and watching a supposed heiress struggle under her feet had given her an almost perverse sense of pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As </span><span>Hubery</span><span> listened to Bertha's deranged and venomous words, it felt as though a knife had been plunged straight into his heart. A searing pain spread through his chest, twisting his features in agony.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting his teeth, he roared, "Bertha!!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="128.html">« Prev</a><a href="130.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
