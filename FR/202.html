They whispered behind my back, calling me aloof. </p><p>But once, I was nothing like that. </p><p>Before I turned five, I was a completely different person—bright, cheerful, always laughing, radiating warmth. Whether at school or at home, I was adored by everyone around me. </p><p>Everything changed after my mother died. My father brought his mistress into our home, and something inside me broke. </p><p>From that moment on, the sunny little boy disappeared. In his place was someone quiet, withdrawn, and simmering with resentment.</p><p>At that age, I didn&#x27;t know how to hide my emotions or temper my words.</p><p>Whenever something upset me, I lashed out without a second thought. More often than not, it was my father&#x27;s mistress who bore the brunt of it.</p><p>Once, I pushed her down the stairs. She lost the baby she was carrying.</p><p>Another time, when she provoked me, I grabbed a knife and pressed it to her throat.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m underage,&quot; I shouted. &quot;Even if I killed you, I wouldn&#x27;t face any real consequences.&quot;</p><p>She hated me with every fiber of her being, wishing nothing more than for me to disappear.</p><p>At first, she thought dealing with a five-year-old would be easy. But she couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong.</p><p>I may have been young, but I knew exactly how to use my age—as both a shield and a weapon.</p><p>To her, I wasn&#x27;t a child. I was a monster hiding in plain sight.</p><p>After the knife incident, fear clung to her like a second skin.</p><p>Every time we crossed paths, she trembled like a cornered mouse.</p><p>Even my father grew cautious around me. He knew better than to dismiss my threats—I meant every word I said.</p><p>Back then, I acted on pure instinct, driven by an unwavering need to protect myself at all costs.</p><p>Anyone who tried to hurt me had to pay—no matter who they were, no matter what it took.</p><p>Ironically, that ruthless streak became my saving grace.</p><p>Despite having a vindictive stepmother, I managed to grow up untouched by her cruelty.</p><p>In time, I learned to suppress my emotions, trading rage for icy self-control.</p><p>People began calling me mature, stable, even gentle.</p><p>On the surface, I was polite and composed. But underneath, nothing had changed—I was still merciless when provoked.</p><p>For years, life played out predictably, almost tediously so.</p><p>The woman who once feared me as a child came to dread me even more as an adult.</p><p>I thought that would be the rhythm of my life—until I moved to Orley and met Aurora, the most important woman in my life.</p><p>It was because of her that I truly understood how cruel the world could be.</p><p>My first impression of her remained vivid.</p><p>She was small and frail, her pale skin almost translucent—so delicate she looked like the wind might carry her away.</p><p>But despite her fragile appearance, she had a quiet boldness about her.</p><p>The very first time we met, she walked right up to me and asked for a cigarette.</p><p>Never in a million years could I have guessed how tangled our fates would become.</p><p>Fate wove its threads silently, bringing us together again and again.</p><p>Each time we crossed paths, she was fighting a new battle—bruised but never broken.</p><p>As cold-hearted as I liked to believe I was, especially toward women, I&#x27;d never been one for patience.</p><p>But Aurora was the one exception.</p><p>Her life was steeped in such tragedy that I couldn&#x27;t help but feel something stir in me—compassion, faint at first, like the flicker of a dying flame.</p><p>That flicker soon became a spark, then a flame, and before I realized it, I was desperate to understand her story.</p><p>By the time I finally uncovered the truth about her past, it hit me—I had already fallen for her.</p><p>Aurora was flawless in every way imaginable.</p><p>A living masterpiece, as if sculpted by the divine.</p><p>Her mind was sharp, her grades immaculate, and her character beyond reproach. Even her embroidery was exquisite—every stitch precise, elegant, and full of quiet strength.</p><p>She was the embodiment of well-rounded brilliance, capable of excelling at anything she set her sights on.</p><p>But her tragic past cast a long, suffocating shadow over her future.</p><p>What should have been a path paved with opportunity was narrowed to a threadbare trail, choked by cruelty and circumstance.</p><p>Within those tight confines, she still managed to shine—in academics and embroidery, the two areas where her talents could breathe.</p><p>They became her outlets, her silent rebellion, the places where her brilliance refused to be extinguished.</p><p>If only Joshua hadn&#x27;t abandoned her so heartlessly, leaving her to fend for herself in a world so indifferent to suffering.</p><p>If only she had grown up within the Elvador family, wrapped in comfort, nurtured by privilege, armed with the best education—there&#x27;s no doubt in my mind she would have soared.</p><p>She had all the makings of greatness—intellect, strength, discipline, grace.</p><p>But those heartless monsters crushed her life under the weight of their greed.</p><p>They dismantled her chances at happiness, piece by piece, with surgical cruelty.</p><p>I pitied her deeply. </p><p>But I was also angry—angry at her kindness. </p><p>Her only flaw was that she cared too much.</p><p>I hated the way she bowed her head, how she humbled herself, giving up every shred of pride just to win back a family that never deserved her.</p><p>Why did she cling to the illusion of kinship?</p><p>Why did she insist on loving people who only hurt her?</p><p>If only she had let go.</p><p>If she had turned her back on them, fought fire with fire instead of tears, maybe—just maybe—her story would&#x27;ve had a different ending.</p><p>In nearly thirty years of life, I&#x27;d never met anyone like her.</p><p>Who wouldn&#x27;t admire her?</p><p>And yet, it was her very normalcy—her quiet goodness—that made the Elvador family&#x27;s madness all the more glaring.</p><p>She was a sane soul trapped in a lunatic asylum, forced to endure their torment day after day.</p><p>Fifteen years in an orphanage.</p><p>Three years of degradation after reuniting with her so-called family.</p><p>Then five years of captivity.</p><p>Not a single day in her twenty-three years was untouched by suffering.</p><p>Even now, thinking of her pain feels like knives tearing through my chest.</p><p>After she left this world, I was completely unmoored—adrift in grief that clung to me like fog, refusing to lift.</p><p>Food became tasteless. Sleep, impossible.</p><p>No woman had ever left a hole in my life like she did.</p><p>Not even my mother&#x27;s death had shaken me like this.</p><p>I used to think someone as cold as me would forget her easily.</p><p>That&#x27;s what I told myself.</p><p>But a month passed, and instead of fading, her memory only sharpened—crisp and aching, like a wound that refused to close.</p><p>The pain of missing her consumed me.</p><p>Now, standing in the living room, my eyes drift involuntarily to the couch by the floor-to-ceiling windows.</p><p>That spot was hers. </p><p>She loved basking in the sunlight there.</p><p>Her body was too delicate for much else, and when the sun wrapped its warmth around her like a quiet embrace, she would often fall asleep without realizing it.</p><p>Curled into the plush cushions, she looked impossibly small—like she barely belonged to this world.</p><p>Sunlight would pour over her, soft and golden, filtering through her porcelain skin until she seemed to glow.</p><p>In those moments, she didn&#x27;t look real.</p><p>She looked like something the world wasn&#x27;t meant to touch.</p><p>Every time I saw her like that, I&#x27;d go still. My eyes would follow the shape of her, soaking in the light dancing along the curve of her silhouette.</p><p>Watching her brought a rare peace, as if—for a moment—the noise of the world fell away.</p><p>But now, that image lived only in memory.</p><p>The weeks after her death were torment. Every hour dragged. Some days, I wasn&#x27;t sure I would survive the grief.</p><p>Then came the revelation that changed everything—we had a daughter.</p><p>All we had ever shared was a fleeting kiss. And yet, somehow, fate had given us a child.</p><p>She came into the world before we truly knew each other.</p><p>I named her Aria, in memory of Aurora.</p><p>And with her arrival, purpose returned to my life.</p><p>Truth be told, I never cared much for children. But Aria was different. </p><p>Maybe it was because she looked so much like Aurora, or perhaps it was the inexplicable bond between parent and child.</p><p>As she grew, the resemblance became undeniable. </p><p>She inherited her mother&#x27;s beauty—refined and radiant—but stood taller, with a more confident posture. </p><p>While Aurora had been burdened by misfortune, Aria thrived in the light of opportunity. She was brilliant, capable, and unstoppable.</p><p>She graduated early and took over the Hawke Group. Watching her thrive filled me with a pride I never knew I could feel. Through her, I gave all the love and care that Aurora had missed out on.</p><p>If there&#x27;s such a thing as another life, I often prayed to find Aurora sooner, to step into her world before the storms came. I wished to stand by her as her unshakable and fearless shield.</p><p>With a loving family and her talent and determination, she would have soared. She was destined for greatness.</p><p>Fifty years slipped by like a dream. </p><p>Now, at nearly eighty, I&#x27;m thin and brittle, worn down by time. My strength trickles away, grain by grain, like sand in an hourglass I can no longer turn.</p><p>I sat in the garden, clutching the embroidered piece &quot;The Garden&quot; Aurora left behind.</p><p>Warm sunlight spilled across my face. With great effort, I pried open my clouded eyes.</p><p>Through the haze of my failing vision, I thought I saw her—Aurora, at twenty-three, as vivid and radiant as she had once been. </p><p>She stood there, smiling softly, sweetly, heartbreakingly beautiful. She reached out her hand to me, her voice like the wind through the trees. </p><p>&quot;Mr. Hawke,&quot; she whispered, &quot;I&#x27;ve come to take you home.&quot; </p><p>A smile touched my lips. </p><p>Without a second thought, I reached out and took her hand, holding it tightly with what little strength I had left.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="201.html">« Prev</a><a href="203.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
