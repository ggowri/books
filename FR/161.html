Take good care of them."</span><br><span>The principal smiled obsequiously until Lily left, then his expression darkened.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">If I had known Lily would turn out to be such a difficult troublemaker, I never would have partnered with Barnett for money. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Initially, Barnett wanted me to expel her for moral corruption.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">But then </span><span style="font-style: italic;">he</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> changed his mind, saying there was no need to expel her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Since then, Lily has been haunting me like a nightmare.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">I don't know how she got the information, but she uncovered the scandal about my involvement in sexual transactions with female students.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">From that moment on, she had leverage over me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Whenever I didn't comply with Lily's wishes, she would threaten me with this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The principal deeply regretted his past decisions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Less than half an hour after Lily left, someone indeed came to the principal's office to complain about Lily beating up classmates in the cafeteria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The principal, already in a foul mood, grew even more irritated when he saw the three girls in disarray. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slammed the table and berated them harshly, his spittle flying as if trying to drown them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three girls were stunned by the scolding. They looked sorrowful, tears welling up in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't understand why they, the victims, were the ones being reprimanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily was in a bad mood and found everyone at school irritating.</span><br><span>She left the school to get some fresh air.</span><br><span>Just then, a sleek motorcycle suddenly pulled up in front of her.</span><br><span>The man on the bike was dressed in black riding gear, his legs propped up on the bike, radiating a striking handsomeness.</span><br><span>Samuel took off his helmet and casually ran a hand through his hair, revealing a handsome yet roguish face. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled and called out, "Ms. Walker."</span><br><span>Lily responded coolly, "What do you want?"</span><br><span>Samuel had initially planned to take Lily home as instructed by his father.</span><br><span>But on the way, a friend called and invited him to a racing event, specifically mentioning that Cynthia Truman would be there.</span><br><span>Cynthia was the ex-girlfriend who had recently dumped him.</span><br><span>Although he hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t cared much for Cynthia, being dumped by her had bruised his pride, and he was feeling frustrated.</span><br><span>So, he had a sudden idea to bring Lily along. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought it would make Cynthia jealous and regretful, thus restoring his dignity.</span><br><span>He mentioned the racing event to Lily.</span><br><span>Lily, uninterested in racing, replied, "I'm not interested," and was about to leave.</span><br><span>Samuel quickly stopped her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Walker, what do I have to do to get you to come with me?"</span><br><span>Lily paused and said, "Give me money."</span><br><span>She needed to return the one million dollars to Ethan, so she had to find other ways to get money.</span><br><span>And Samuel, with his wealth, was a potential source.</span><br><span>Samuel immediately smiled. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How much do you want?"</span><br><span>Lily answered, "How much are you willing to give?"</span><br><span>"That depends on your performance," Samuel said with a grin. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you act as my girlfriend, how about I give you 100 thousand dollars?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">A hundred thousand dollars for a day? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That's a pretty good deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily agreed without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took the helmet Samuel handed her and put it on securely. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she smoothly got on the bike behind Samuel, naturally wrapping her arms around his waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel glanced down at her arms around his waist and couldn't help but smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Walker, hold on tight," he said, gently twisting the throttle. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The motorcycle roared with a deep, powerful sound, like a beast ready to pounce, speeding off toward the eastern suburbs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The eastern suburbs were being developed for new real estate, so the roads there were almost devoid of private cars. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The roads were wide and smooth, perfect for racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Samuel and Lily arrived, a large crowd had already gathered at the starting point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mostly men, with one woman in her twenties standing out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was wearing a white dress, with long black hair and light makeup, exuding an aura of pure, delicate charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing among the men, she looked like a blooming white </span><span>rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first glance, Lily felt a deep sense of dislike for the girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because the girl's appearance and demeanor were exactly like Bertha's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">They both look pure and innocent, but in reality, they're as venomous as snakes, doing all sorts of bad things. It's because of Bertha that Aurora ended up in such a tragic situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Lily had no fondness for such women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After getting off the bike, two men ran up to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hi, Ms. Walker!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Walker, welcome."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily vaguely remembered them. They were Samuel's friends who had once dragged her into a restroom, intending to teach her a lesson. Instead, she stabbed them with a knife. Later, at a bar, she hit them with a bottle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't know their names, but she remembered their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily nodded slightly, her expression remaining cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's aloof demeanor immediately caught the attention of another group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked her up and down. She was dressed simply in a white shirt, jeans, and sneakers, looking like a well-behaved college student.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the men couldn't resist teasing, "Are you Mr. Samuel Lowell's new girlfriend? You're still in school, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another man joined in. "Hey, beauty, don't be fooled by Samuel's serious demeanor. He's not a good guy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl in the white dress stared intently at Lily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily could see the hostility in her eyes, but she didn't care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She also ignored the men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's indifference made the group feel slighted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, beauty, why don't you introduce yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man speaking was chewing gum, and then he pulled the girl in the white dress into his arms and looked provocatively at Samuel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel clenched his teeth, his eyes almost spitting fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Cynthia, you're something else. You just dumped me, and now you're in the arms of my rival, Edie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel stepped forward, shielding Lily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're here to race, not to chat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Samuel defend Lily, Edie became even more interested. He looked at Lily as if she were some amusing prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course. But let's change the rules this time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel frowned, "What rules?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edie looked at Lily with ill intent. "Each of us carries a woman. If I lose, I'll give you my woman. If you lose, you give me yours. How about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel's face turned pale. He was about to refuse when he felt Lily tugging at his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily looked at Edie with a faint smile, her expression enigmatic. "Deal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Since he's asking for trouble, why not satisfy him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily!" Samuel looked at her with concern. "Racing is fast. You might not be able to handle it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's fine," Lily said, already getting on the bike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia also coquettishly sat behind Edie. She looked at Lily with a challenging gaze, as if saying, "Just wait to surrender!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Winning or losing wasn't important to Lily. Finding an opportunity to fight was her goal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After both sides were ready, with a loud starting signal, the two motorcycles shot forward like arrows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bikes were incredibly fast, the wind roaring past. Lily held tightly to Samuel's waist, feeling the heat emanating from his body and the intense vibrations from the high-speed ride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scenery rushed by in a blur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two bikes were neck and neck, neither gaining an advantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A curve appeared ahead, and Samuel suddenly shouted, "Ms. Walker, hold on tight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily tightened her grip around Samuel's waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, they reached the curve. Samuel didn't slow down, leaning into the turn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their bodies tilted with the bike, tracing a beautiful yet dangerous arc.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel executed a perfect overtake at the curve, leaving the other bike behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The engine roared on the open road, and Samuel shouted excitedly, "Ms. Walker, how does it feel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily rarely smiled, but now a faint smile appeared beneath her helmet, looking particularly captivating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was about to respond when suddenly, a black Maybach came into view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that car too well&mdash;it was Ethan's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the motorcycle sped past the Maybach, Ethan, who was driving, caught a glimpse of Lily. He was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily was wearing a helmet, so he couldn't see her face. But Ethan clearly remembered her outfit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had seen Lily's back at the Hawke Estate that very morning. She was wearing the same clothes.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="160.html">« Prev</a><a href="162.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
