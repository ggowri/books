You won't even acknowledge your own mother?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora wasn't even looking at her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had no idea what Celeste had said, nor did she care. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was exactly this disregard, this silence from Aurora, that made Celeste</span><span>'</span><span>s heart ache even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy, standing by, was livid with anger and scolded, "Mrs. Celeste Elvador, you have no right to call Ms. Elvador heartless! In the three years she lived in the Elvador Villa, you never cared for her once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You knew full well that </span><span>she</span><span> suffered for fifteen years in that orphanage. After she finally returned to the Elvador family, you never paid attention to her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Every month, you had the finances send Bertha one million, but not a penny went to </span><span>her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bertha dresse</span><span>d</span><span> up beautifully every day, while</span><span> </span><span>Ms. Elvador only had one set of high school uniforms for an entire year. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You saw it, yet acted as if you didn</span><span>'</span><span>t. Not once did you buy </span><span>her </span><span>new clothes in three years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Elvador and Bertha were born on the same day, yet every single year, you threw a grand birthday party for Bertha alone. The presents? Also just for Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Elvador left early and came home late for school, going an entire day without a hot meal, while your family of four sat around the table, eating, drinking, and laughing together. And when I suggested bringing her food, you forbade me, saying if she didn't come home to eat, then she must not be hungry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking on with eyes filled with contempt, Daisy sneered, "Ms. Elvador was in high school, a time when she needed proper nutrition the most, yet you left her so malnourished she was pale and thin, her hair dry and brittle. And you still had the nerve to say that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, you didn't beat her like Joshua, and you didn't frame her like Bertha. But your indifference&mdash;standing by and watching without care&mdash;was even more despicable than outright abuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I still remember every single vile thing you've done, clear as day. So tell me, what right do you have to call Ms. Elvador heartless? What gives you the right to accuse her of abandoning you? Go ahead, ask yourself&mdash;have you ever, even once, acted like a real mother to her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy had kept these words bottled up in her heart for years. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, during the five years Aurora was wrongfully imprisoned, she had more than once thought about leaving the Elvador Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But back then, Lily was still in high school, and everything needed money. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Lily went to college, the expenses only grew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As much as the Elvador family was full of despicable people, the pay wasn't bad. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, Daisy worried that if she left, there would be no one left to truly care for Aurora when she got out and returned to the Elvador Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So despite all her grievances, Daisy gritted her teeth and endured. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And in the end, what happened later proved that she had made the right choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That time, Celeste had smashed an ashtray over Aurora's head just to cover for Bertha, leaving her bleeding profusely. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Daisy hadn't carried Aurora out and happened to run into Julian, Aurora might not have survived at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every single one of these memories was seared into Daisy's mind. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, after all these years, she finally had the chance to pour out everything she had been holding in. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The relief was overwhelming, like a weight had been lifted off her chest, and all the pent-up frustration dissipated in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice and Ashley had known Aurora had suffered in the Elvador Villa, but they never imagined that even Aurora's own mother could be so heartless. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they looked at Celeste now, their eyes were filled with nothing but disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wilson and Lizeth, on the other hand, were in utter disbelief. As parents themselves, with daughters they doted on, they couldn't fathom how anyone could treat their own child this way. Otherwise, they wouldn't have gone to such extremes in their revenge against Aurora after Camille fell into a vegetative state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that they had learned that Aurora had not only been wrongfully imprisoned but also suffered through their blind retaliation, they were overwhelmed with guilt and regret. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And when they looked at Celeste again, all they could see was a vile, repulsive woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph, collapsed on the floor, was drowning in unbearable sorrow, too ashamed to even face Aurora. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Joshua, who was sitting in his wheelchair and paralyzed on one side, actually shed tears of remorse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha wasn't even his daughter. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua had been lied to for over twenty years, and for the sake of a child who wasn't even related to him, he had beaten and berated his own flesh and blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That bastard child Bertha had been pampered like a princess for more than two decades, while his real daughter had been abandoned, left to grow up in an orphanage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua took in a trembling breath, his tears falling uncontrollably.</span><br><span>I actually threw my own daughter in prison for that bastard kid... and even stole Aurora's kidney to save Bertha? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of idiot does that? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was Bertha, that little snake, secretly mocking me behind my back? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Isabella and Frank, those two cheating rats, were they laughing at how stupid I was the whole time?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grief weighed on Joshua like an unbearable burden, pressing down on him so hard that he could barely breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah... ah..." He wanted to confess, to pour out the overwhelming regret suffocating him, but the moment he opened his mouth, saliva dribbled uncontrollably down his chin. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All that came from his throat were garbled, unintelligible sounds&mdash;words lost before they could even form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste, on the other hand, was yanked back into the past by Daisy's words. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The memories of how cruelly she had treated Aurora played in her mind like an old film, scene after scene flashing by in relentless succession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's gaze turned hollow in an instant. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each memory felt like a needle, stabbing deep into her heart, twisting with a pain so sharp it was unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could see it&mdash;Aurora as a child, standing quietly in the corner in her worn-out school uniform, watching as Bertha basked in the attention of their peers. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her little face was filled with longing and quiet sorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Celeste? She had ignored it all, turning a blind eye to the obvious, lavishing all her love and care on Bertha without a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No... no..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste mumbled, clutching her head as her body trembled violently. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wished desperately that this was nothing more than a nightmare, that she could wake up and somehow turn back time, fix everything, and make up for all the ways she had failed Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste then remembered the way Aurora used to look at her, pleading for help whenever Joshua lashed out. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, Celeste had chosen to turn away, indifferent, cold. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, that haunting gaze clung to her like a ghost, wrapping around her, suffocating her, leaving her nowhere to run.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pounded her fists against her chest as if she could break through the regret clawing at her soul. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only time could rewind and if only she had another chance, she would hold Aurora tightly, buy her beautiful dresses, throw her grand birthday parties, and make her the happiest girl in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But time was cruel&mdash;it never rewound, never gave second chances. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how much Celeste wished she could undo the past, the damage was already done. The hurt she had caused was irreversible, seared into Aurora's life like an unshakable burden, buried deep within Celeste's own soul&mdash;an agony neither of them would ever escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears spilled down Celeste's face uncontrollably. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sobbed, raw and broken, as if years of suppressed guilt and remorse were finally ripping free. There was nothing left of her former pride&mdash;no dignity, no composure. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was just a mother, drowning in the unbearable weight of her own mistakes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, suddenly, she spun around, eyes blazing with fury, and threw herself at Joshua. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her fists rained down on him in a blind, unhinged rage. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It</span><span>'</span><span>s all your fault! If you hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t thrown my daughter into the orphanage, Aurora should have grown up happily under my love. You stole her rightful happiness!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua, unable to resist, was beaten until his face was bruised and swollen. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste grew tired of hitting him.
