I'm just a kid</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, you're a Barron now. After today, everyone will know you're my daughter." Laura took a deep breath. "We'd like to make it official&mdash;change your name to Aurora Barron. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Truthfully, Laura didn't need to ask for the opinion of a five-year-old child.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But out of respect for Aurora, </span><span>she</span><span> </span><span>did</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura looked both excited and nervous, waiting for Aurora's response.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Aurora was deeply moved.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What she had longed for most wasn't just familial love&mdash;it was respect.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During those three years with the Elvador family, no one had ever respected her.</span><span> </span><span>They treated her like dirt, bossing her around and punishing her for nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And in those five years in prison</span><span>?</span><span> </span><span>It was even worse. S</span><span>he had no dignity left, trampled into the dirt.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But n</span><span>ow, at just five years old, Aurora was</span><span> getting the</span><span> respect she</span><span>'</span><span>d always dreamed of.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many adults wouldn't </span><span>care about </span><span>a </span><span>kid</span><span>'</span><span>s opinion</span><span>, but the Barrons treated her like she truly mattered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled up in Aurora's eyes as she hugged her tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura was startled by her reaction. "Sweetheart, why are you crying? Don't you want this? If you don't like it, we can forget about it. Please don't cry."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora nodded repeatedly as silent tears streamed down her face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mommy, I</span><span> want this</span><span>. I want to be part of this family. I'm just... really touched."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura gently patted Aurora's small back. </span><br><span>Poor kid! She</span><span> must have suffered so much in th</span><span>at</span><span> orphanage to be moved so easily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'll make sure she feels loved and safe from now on.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, </span><span>Laura took out a handkerchief and wiped Aurora's tears.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sweetheart, don't cry. If your eyes get puffy, you won't look as pretty later."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora sniffled and smiled up at Laura.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Aurora stopped crying, Laura finally relaxed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, are you thirsty? Hungry? Let me grab you a snack or something."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had only </span><span>had</span><span> a slice of birthday cake in the morning, so she wasn't hungry, but she was a little thirsty.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mommy, I'd like some water."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, wait here for me, okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Laura left, Aurora and William were </span><span>just </span><span>chilling in the lounge.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, some unexpected guests showed up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm so tired! Why hasn't the party started yet? I don't want to walk anymore."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bertha, there's a lounge here."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the voices sounded, the lounge door swung open.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora and William looked up to see Barnett and Bertha walking in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora frowned. </span><br><span>Why are they here?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celestia Palace had been reserved by the Barron family</span><span>. O</span><span>nly invited guests were allowed inside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't re</span><span>member</span><span> the Elvadors being on the guest list.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment William saw them, he remembered yesterday's incident where they had tried to snatch Aurora's dress.</span><span> </span><span>He immediately stood up, his face cold with anger.</span><span> </span><span>"How did you get in here? Get out!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett and Bertha finally noticed them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett scowled, "Why are you nouveau riche trash here?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, I get it&mdash;you're trying to take this chance to cozy up to other wealthy families, aren't you?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course. For low-class upstarts like you, getting in with a noble family could set you up for life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But since we've caught you, don't think your little</span><span> </span><span>selfish scheme will work.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If anyone should get out, it's you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's words were vicious. He had already forgotten how William had </span><span>easily </span><span>beaten him</span><span> </span><span>yesterday.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He strode forward, grabbing William and shoving him toward the door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out! Filthy beggars like you don't belong in a seven-star hotel. You're lowering the standards just by being here."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora felt her anger rise with every insult Barnett spat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Barnett is always like this&mdash;jumping to conclusions and blaming others without even understanding the situation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So even as a child, he was already this insufferable. What a lost cause.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What disgusted Aurora most was Barnett's arrogance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could tolerate it, but how dare he lay a hand on my brother?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damn! </span><span>He's just asking for </span><span>trouble!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Aurora swung her hand and slapped Barnett across the face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp impact snapped Barnett's head to the side, leaving his cheek red and swollen.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go of my brother," Aurora said, her eyes filled with revulsion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett was stunned by the sudden slap. When he met Aurora's icy glare, an inexplicable chill ran down his spine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her brother </span><span>hit</span><span>, Bertha rushed forward.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You little bitch! How dare you hit my brother? I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could reach Aurora, another slap sent her stumbling.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally snapping out of his daze, Barnett shoved Aurora hard. "You've got a death wish, huh?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora staggered, nearly falling, but William caught her in time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm warning you&mdash;get out now, or I won't hold back."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett felt a</span><span> burning</span><span> hatred for William, especially </span><span>seeing</span><span> Aurora defend </span><span>him</span><span> so fiercely. It made his blood boil.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine. You've got guts."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Barnett lunged at William, ready to throw a punch.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora quickly grabbed William's hand and pulled him toward the door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want to escalate things with the Elvadors. </span><br><span>It</span><span>'s my birthday. If we end up covered in bruises, it'll embarrass the Barron family in front of the guests.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">We should</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> find Mom and Dad.</span><span> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">They</span><span style="font-style: italic;">'</span><span style="font-style: italic;">ll</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> call security </span><span style="font-style: italic;">and kick </span><span style="font-style: italic;">the Elvadors out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"William, let's not waste time with these lunatics. Let's find Mom and Dad."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hand in hand, the two ran out of the lounge.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett </span><span>glared at them and then </span><span>grabbed Bertha</span><span>, racing</span><span> after them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to teach you a lesson!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha's eyes burned with envy as she stared at Aurora's designer princess dress.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I've never even worn </span><span style="font-style: italic;">anything</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> that beautiful.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How dare this low-class upstart dress better than me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Once I catch her, I'm tearing that dress to shreds!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, </span><span>Aurora and William sprinted toward the elevator.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as they reached it, the doors slid open, revealing a group of people.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the front was a girl, maybe eight or nine, with a bunch of tall teenage boys behind her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora tried to </span><span>step in</span><span>, but the girl shoved her back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing?" Aurora snapped.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl looked her up and down. When she noticed Aurora holding William's hand, her gaze turned icy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Oh,</span><span> you're the Barron couple's adopted daughter?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora frowned. "Do I know you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl's expression darkened further.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you hadn't seduced Julian, you'd be a nobody to me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you dared to compete with me for Julian, you'll pay</span><span>!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she raised her hand to strike.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Megan, don't you dare! </span><span>T</span><span>ouch my sister, </span><span>and </span><span>the Barron family will make you regret it!"</span><span> </span><span>William roared</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Megan paused, sneering, "Everyone in Putnam knows Julian and I grew up together. He's min</span><span>e. </span><span>I'm going to marry him when we're older.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Every other girl knows to stay away from him, but this slut keeps clinging to him&mdash;even visiting his </span><span>place</span><span>!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, I'm going to teach her a lesson."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not </span><span>happening,</span><span>" William </span><span>said, </span><span>shielding Aurora.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Megan scoffed, "Hold William down. I'll deal with the bitch."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her command, her brothers seized William.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At only ten years old, William was no match for the older, stronger boys.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pinned and helpless, he shouted to Aurora, "Aurora, take the stairs! Find Mom and Dad!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora gritted her teeth. "Hold on!" She turned and bolted for the stairwell.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Barnett and Bertha caught up, joining Megan in chasing Aurora.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett managed to grab Aurora's arm, refusing to let go.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cornered at the top of the stairs, Aurora struggled furiously.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barnett, you bastard! Let me go!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett stiffened. "How do you know my name?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora ignored him, fighting harder to break free.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, </span><span>Megan raised her hand triumphantly. "Julian belongs to me!" She swung her palm down&mdash;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Aurora jabbed Barnett in the stomach, making him double over in pain and let her go.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seizing the </span><span>moment</span><span>, Aurora dashed down the stairs, dodging Megan's slap.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha panicked, and in the chaos, shoved Megan down the stairs instead</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A loud thud followed by Megan's piercing scream echoed through the stairwell.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora, standing at the bottom of the staircase, witnessed everything.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes widened in shock, a flashback to her past hitting her hard</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like before, Camille was pushed down by Bertha, lying in a pool of blood.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, Bertha had stood at the top with Joshua, while Aurora watched from below.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stared up in disbelief. </span><br><span>Now, history repeated itself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Bertha's only five, and she's already this malicious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bertha, have you lost your mind?!" Aurora screamed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha, pale with panic, pointed at Aurora and shrieked. "It wasn't me! It&mdash;it was you! You pushed her!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="215.html">« Prev</a><a href="217.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
