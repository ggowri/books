There was a special connection between them that Lily felt on a gut level.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily had lost her father when she was just a kid and was raised by her mom alone. School was a tough place for her, as the other kids would pick on her and call her a "bastard."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she wasn't the sweetest-tempered </span><span>girl,</span><span> around Aurora, she just naturally kept her negative feelings under wraps.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily asked, "Aurora, can we snap a pic together?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had no reason to say no. They took the photo, and Aurora went a step further and set it as the wallpaper on her phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, I'll be waiting for you at the Science and Technology Research Institute," Aurora said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's extra attention to Lily left the onlookers </span><span>gobsmacked</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"OMG, Lily is one lucky gal! She really caught Aurora's fancy!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't wrap my head around it! Is this what they mean by great minds thinking alike?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh, all we can do is eat our hearts out."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Basking in the warm admiration of the crowd, Lily nodded with determination. "Aurora, don't worry. I'll try my best to get into the Science and Technology Research Institute and be your workmate someday."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speech wrapped up smoothly, and Lily, fueled by Aurora's inspiration, was even more fired up to succeed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even at MIT, a hotbed of top-notch talent, she was hell-bent on not falling behind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the day wound down, Aurora was ushered out of the school by the president and the others.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was feeling a bit </span><span>tired </span><span>and just yearned to head home and crash </span><span>on</span><span> her bed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Aurora never saw it coming when she stepped out of her car, and there was Celeste.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had long gotten over the bad stuff Celeste did to her in her past life, but that didn't mean she was eager to see Celeste.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing here?" Aurora shot straight out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste looked like she'd been punched in the gut by Aurora's cold-as-ice response. "Aurora, I just wanted </span><span>to&mdash;"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora cut her off in a huff. "Cut the crap. You came here just to find me, right? Ms. Jerome, our relationship is history. I think it's best if we just go our separate ways and act like strangers. Don't you agree?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't bug you. Just make sure you don't bother my parents again.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been harboring a grudge for ages. No matter how many lifetimes I live, I can't forget what you guys did to me. I'm just itching for revenge, so you'd better stay </span><span>outta</span><span> my way. One of these days, I might just snap and do something crazy."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's words hit Celeste like a punch, and she staggered, almost losing her footing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked utterly devastated, with a sorrow-filled, tear-streaked face that would surely tug at the heartstrings of any onlooker.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was exactly this kind of act that Aurora couldn't stand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, every time the </span><span>Elvador</span><span> family did her wrong, Celeste would put on that same pitiful act, making it seem like she was the victim while Aurora was left in ruins.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora fumed, her irritation reaching a boiling point. "Enough!</span><span> </span><span>Celeste, cut </span><span>it out</span><span>. They just make you look fake as hell.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm giving you one last heads-up. I don't want to see your face, and I </span><span>definitely don't</span><span> want you anywhere near my parents. If I catch you here again, </span><span>I won't go easy on you</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her parents were her red line.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's constant dropping by at the Barron Estate was bound to mess with her parents' peace of mind. Aurora just wanted them to live happy, hassle-free lives, and not have to deal with the </span><span>Elvador</span><span> family's nonsense.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had been through way too much undeserved pain. It was no wonder she found it a tall order to trust Celeste, even if the latter had turned over a new leaf.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right then, she was itching to lay into Celeste with some scathing remarks.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each word would be like a bullet to the heart for Celeste.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, being stabbed in the back by someone she loved? That was a pain that cut deeper than any knife.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste was devastated.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She found it hard to imagine how</span><span> Aurora </span><span>made </span><span>it through all those years of being betrayed by the people closest to her</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm really sorry, Aurora," Celeste managed to blurt out, her voice thick with emotion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're truly sorry, then do me a favor and vanish from my life. Don't ever let me catch a glimpse of you again," Aurora snapped.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she spun on her heel and marched into the house.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Celeste watched her unwavering back, </span><span>her </span><span>tears started flowing like a broken dam.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It's all my fault; I've dug my own grave.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All she wished for now was for Aurora to find happiness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was no need for her to lose sleep over it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Barron family doted on Aurora like she was the apple of their eye.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then there was Julian, the knight in shining armor who'd rescued her in her past life and was by her side once again in this one.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora also had a bunch of well-heeled friends. No one in their right mind would dare mess with her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, she'd even brought over the person Aurora cared about the most, so at least she could leave with a clear conscience.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reluctantly, Celeste shuffled away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, as Aurora stepped into the villa, a tantalizing, familiar aroma tickled her nostrils.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes landed on the dining table, where a bowl of pasta sat invitingly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprise washed over her like a wave. She approached it slowly, her heart pounding like a drum at the sight of the dish.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, you're home!" Laura's voice cut through her reverie.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a warm smile, she said, "You must be hungry, right? Come on</span><span>. D</span><span>ig into this pasta!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora took a seat and popped a forkful into her mouth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The instant the well-known flavors danced on her taste </span><span>buds,</span><span> she couldn't hold back the floodgates of her emotions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over </span><span>the seventeen</span><span> years since her rebirth, she'd dined at all the poshest restaurants, but in her heart, nothing could hold a candle to Daisy's pasta.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, tasting that very same flavor again made her emotions go haywire.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears plopped into her bowl, mingling with the pasta, but she didn't care. She just kept on eating.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at you, acting like you haven't eaten in ages!" Laura laughed. "Slow down, or you'll end up choking!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora polished off the pasta in just a few bites.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sniffing, she wiped her eyes and turned to her mom. "Mom, who whipped up this pasta?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura reached over to the table, grabbed a tissue, and gently dabbed at the tears in the corners of Aurora's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I told you to take it easy! See what happened? You're crying because you choked," Laura chided, a hint of amusement in her voice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora couldn't suppress a grin.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, come on, Mom! For real, who made this pasta? It's </span><span>so delicious</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura beamed. "I think she's an amazing cook, so I asked her to stick around."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she called out towards the kitchen, "Daisy, could you step out here for a sec?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, a familiar face emerged in front of </span><span>Aurora</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sight of Daisy, Aurora's emotions went into overdrive. Without a second thought, she dashed forward and wrapped her arms tightly around Daisy.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="236.html">« Prev</a><a href="238.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
