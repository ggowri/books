After everything, </span><span>Joshua</span><span>'s in this condition, and you want to suffocate him with a trash bag? Are you even human?" Bertha raised her hand, about to slap Aurora, but Aurora swiftly grabbed her wrist and pushed her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up if you don't understand," Aurora snapped, her voice shaking everyone into silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cast a cold glance at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Putting a plastic bag over someone's head helps them breathe in more carbon dioxide. When someone hyperventilates, they lose too much CO2, which messes with their blood's pH balance. Breathing into a bag lets them re-breathe CO2 and helps fix this imbalance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sneered, "Bertha, didn't you do well in high school? Weren't you in the top ten of your class? How do you not even understand something as simple as this?" Aurora mocked her, her tone dripping with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha, red-faced with anger, fell silent and didn't dare to argue back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Joshua finally began to recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tore the trash bag off his head, threw it to the ground, and tried to lunge at Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's cold voice rang out. "I suggest you stay calm. If you relapse, don't expect the same luck next time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you ungrateful brat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora glanced at him indifferently, sneered, and turned to go upstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua, seething, shouted, "If you're so tough, don't stay upstairs. Go back to that storage room you used to sleep in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stood at the top of the stairs, looking down at him. "I didn't stay there before because I didn't want to owe you anything. But now, I'm staying there because I saved your life. To me, your life is only worth one room. If I wanted more, I'd take the whole villa, and you'd be the ones who'd have to leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... You're twisting things!" Joshua, his anger boiling over, was on the verge of another breakdown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett hurriedly picked up the plastic bag from the floor and placed it over Joshua's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua kept breathing in and out, the bag inflating and deflating humorously on his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora smirked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once she stopped caring, she could act without restraint. Watching their frustration brought her a satisfaction she had never known before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in her bedroom, Aurora lay down on the soft bed and exhaled deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had to admit, the bed was comfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had she not been stolen from her birth family, these past twenty-something years, she would've woken up every morning on such a soft bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She closed her eyes, silently savoring this rare moment of peace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>About ten minutes later, there was a knock on her door, three rhythmic taps. From the sound and timing, she knew it was Daisy, because the Elvador family barged in without any manners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, it was Daisy, carrying a steaming plate of pasta.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come eat pasta."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora sat up against the headboard of the bed and took the plate from Daisy's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As always, the pasta smelled wonderful, topped with thick sauce and a soft egg, making the entire plate irresistible with its rich, comforting aroma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You only ate a few bites earlier. You must still be hungry," Daisy said with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's eyes turned slightly red. "Daisy, thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of everyone in the Elvador Villa, only Daisy was kind to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy knew when to show warmth, when to take care of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she was beaten, Daisy would step in to protect her. If it weren't for Daisy, she didn't know how many times she would've died by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have made it in this house," she said, her voice thick with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy, seeing Aurora's eyes misting, felt a pang of sympathy. After hesitating for a moment, she suddenly said, "Why don't... Why don't you sneak away tonight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's eyes turned a little redder, and a warm current surged in her chest. She looked up at Daisy, her voice trembling slightly. "Daisy, I know you mean well, but I can't leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why not? Don't tell me you're still attached to this house. You have no idea how heartless Mr. Joshua Elvador is. Just yesterday, your shoulder wound was still stitched up, the anesthesia hadn't even worn off, and your dad insisted on taking you home, all just to force you into a marriage with the Hawke family heir." Daisy's voice was filled with both anger and concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't understand how, as a parent, anyone could be so cruel to their child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Aurora hadn't been raised by them&mdash;how could they not love her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they didn't love her, how could they actively harm her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was so unfortunate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy didn't mention the worst of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yesterday in the hospital, when Aurora had been unconscious and unable to wake up, Joshua didn't care about her wounds. He dragged her off the bed and threw her to the ground, ripping open her freshly sewn wound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood soaked through her hospital gown, and she had to be rushed back to surgery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy couldn't bring herself to tell Aurora the whole truth&mdash;it was too brutal, and she feared Aurora wouldn't be able to handle it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe... maybe marrying into the Hawke family isn't so bad after all," Aurora said with a faint smile, trying to comfort Daisy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why go through all that? You've suffered so much in this house. They don't deserve you doing anything for them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora didn't speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew very well that the Elvador family wasn't worth it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Daisy and Lily were worth everything to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a deep breath. "Wow, this smells so good. I need to eat it quickly before it gets soggy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she began eating the pasta in large, eager bites.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy sighed inwardly. Aurora's heart was still too soft. If it were anyone else, they would've been filled with nothing but hatred by now, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the pasta was gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Daisy took the empty plate and left, Aurora's forced smile slowly faded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her heart, she silently swore, "Daisy, just wait a little longer. Once I marry into the Hawke family and get that ten-million-dollar dowry, I'll send you and Lily abroad. You two are my weakness. Once you're free from the Elvador family's control, I'll have nothing holding me back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From that day on, Aurora stayed in her bedroom, only leaving to eat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She avoided interacting with the Elvador family as much as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything was calm. Bertha surprisingly kept quiet, no longer looking for trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seven days passed in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One morning, after finishing her usual routine, Aurora went downstairs for breakfast. As she opened the door, she found Celeste standing outside with a shopping bag in hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's face turned cold. "What is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the past few days, Aurora had been keeping this icy attitude, and whenever Celeste tried to get close, she had subtly deflected her attempts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste smiled warmly, almost like she was offering a gift, and handed the shopping bag to Aurora. "Aurora, try this on. I picked out a dress just for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora didn't even look at it. "Cut the act. Just tell me what you want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words immediately took Celeste off guard, and her smile froze. "Aurora, must we really be this estranged? I'm just trying to be a good mother and give you a dress. Don't you even want to give me a chance to fulfill my responsibility?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora smiled bitterly, her grin full of mockery. "You never cared before, and now suddenly you do? You're too late. And don't try to play the good mother card. If you want to help me, how about giving me money instead of this dress? If I had money, I could buy whatever I want.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need for you to decide for me. A dress is only useful at a party, and you're clearly trying to get something out of me. Why not just admit it? There's a Hawke family heir at this event, right? That's why you need me in a dress."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each word hit with precision, and Aurora didn't spare Celeste any mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's eyes welled up with tears, which seemed to flow on command. She shook her head, looking hurt. "Aurora, that's not it. How could you think that of me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? So I misunderstood? If that's the case, I don't need the dress. Take it back. I don't like it. Just give me the money instead," Aurora said, extending her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste froze in place, caught in an awkward spot, unsure of how to proceed.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="44.html">« Prev</a><a href="46.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
