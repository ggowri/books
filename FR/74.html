Word had spread among the doctors and nurses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, who could believe that a person would end up in the hospital so often, covered in injuries?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made him doubt the stories the Elvador family had been telling. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was Aurora really bullying Bertha as they said?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that were the case, why was it always Aurora who ended up injured and hospitalized, and not Bertha?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last time, she had whip marks all over her body, and her little finger was broken. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, she had suffered a blow to the back of her head, a wound so severe it had nearly caused an infection that could have cost her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren's mind drifted back to the night when Aurora had run away to Sounan, planning to take a train to Gelaun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, she didn't want to stay with the Elvador family at all. She only wanted to get as far away as possible, but he and Barnett dragged her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, he had fully sided with Bertha and treated Aurora harshly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until later that he realized Aurora must have been deeply disappointed with the family, which was why she didn't want to return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he suspected that her heart had been shattered by the family again, and that was why she had left while everyone was distracted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was so lost in his thoughts that he didn't even notice Barnett talking to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Darren?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren snapped back to attention. "What's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett frowned deeply. "Where do you think Aurora might have gone? Could she have run away to another city like last time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren dismissed it with a vague answer. "Maybe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She has no money, and her body is weak. What if she encounters bad people out there? She's so stubborn, why can't she just talk things out with the family instead of causing trouble all the time..." Barnett kept going on and on, his frustration clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Listening to Barnett's endless complaining, and remembering how he had mentioned yesterday that Camille had almost been strangled to death after waking up, Darren was tempted to tell him to shut up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camille had already admitted that Aurora was not responsible for the harm back then. She woke up without any ill will toward her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, there was no way that Aurora was the one trying to strangle her to death, unless she was out of her mind</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The answer was obvious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he didn't want to admit it, facts were facts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could see it, so he didn't believe Barnett couldn't. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only explanation was that Barnett had realized the truth but didn't want to face it. He was still protecting Bertha. </span><span>No doubt</span><span>, Aurora would be upset.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he were Aurora, being falsely accused of attempted murder by her brother and imprisoned for five years, he would've had the urge to </span><span>destroy them all</span><span>, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't surprising that Aurora ran away. The way the Elvador family treated her and Bertha was so blatantly unfair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he thought about his bias toward Aurora over the years and how he had spoken harshly to her every time they met, he was filled with frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a man known for his integrity, Darren felt he had been used as a pawn, </span><span>played</span><span> around like a fool, just </span><span>doing whatever they wanted</span><span> without question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes caught a glimpse of Joshua through the glass of the hospital room door. He was comforting Bertha, </span><span>who was sobbing, </span><span>his face full of tenderness. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That sight made Darren's expression darkened immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua was truly hopeless. His biological daughter had been wronged, yet instead of offering comfort or protection, he was showering his adopted daughter with sympathy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have work to do. </span><span>See you</span><span>," Darren said, his tone cutting through the air as he turned on his heel, not sparing a glance back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren, however, didn't return to his office. Instead, he headed straight for the direction of the surveillance room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camille was staying in a VIP room, and for the convenience of monitoring her condition, her room was equipped with surveillance cameras.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when he reached the surveillance room and tried to pull up the footage, the computer screen displayed the chilling words: [Video file deleted.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression immediately turned cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of contemplation, he decided to check the footage of Bertha and Aurora entering Camille's room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to his shock, the footage from the hallway camera was also deleted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression grew even graver, a creeping suspicion gnawing at him. Something about this situation didn't add up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this hospital, even the medical staff couldn't access the surveillance footage without permission. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only a select few had the privilege to do so, and as a key doctor at Orley Central Hospital, he was one of the few who could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant that whoever had deleted the footage must have had a higher level of access, definitely not a regular nurse or doctor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who was helping the real culprit?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren's face hardened as the weight of the situation sank in. He had to confront Camille personally to get some answers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After reaching Camille's ward, Darren gently knocked on the door before pushing it open and stepping inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Camille was quietly lying on the bed, her gaze hollow as she stared at the ceiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren walked over to the bedside and first expressed concern about her health, but all he received in response was her silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a soft sigh, he shifted his approach. "I know what happened in your room yesterday."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camille seemed to not hear his words at all, lying still with no reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Camille, don't you want to bring the person who truly harmed you to justice?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I wanted to, of course.</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">How could I not?</span><span> she exclaimed inwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she had seen it yesterday. Joshua, Celeste, Barnett, Hubery, and even her brother, Adolph, had all been intentionally favoring Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, she had the chance to accuse Bertha, but they repeatedly stopped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but wonder if Bertha was that important to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So important that they were willing to disregard her pain and the five years of unjust suffering Aurora had endured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren ha</span><span>d</span><span> always had a good relationship with the Elvador family, so</span><span> she believed</span><span> he must be one of them</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camille didn't respond to his question, remaining still in her bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren tried to persuade her for a while, but </span><span>words just wouldn&rsquo;t come out of her mouth</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It</span><span> was driving Darren mad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at her and said in a deep voice, "Aurora is missing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the mention of Aurora's disappearance, there was a subtle shift in Camille's eyes. Her once-empty gaze flickered, as though something had deeply pierced her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His keen observation caught the change instantly, and inwardly, he felt a surge of triumph. He knew his words had struck a chord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pressed on. "The Elvador family, Hubery, and your brother are all looking for her. You should know what they'll do when they find her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of the beatings and humiliations Aurora had suffered from those people yesterday, Camille let out a soft sound in her throat, tears streaming down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She desperately tried to speak, but only muffled "ah" sounds. Frustrated, she could only let her tears fall freely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren gently wiped her tears away. "Don't cry. Everything will be okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once her emotions settled, Darren softly said again, "Rest well. When you're better, you'll be able to help Aurora identify the real culprit who harmed you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After offering a few more words of encouragement, he turned and left without lingering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to go to the Orley Caring Hospital to take a look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the car pulled out of the garage, Darren caught sight of two people in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was quite a coincidence that he recognized both of them. One was the hospital's director, Isabella Steele, and the other was Bertha's driver. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't remember the driver's full name, only that his last name was Steele.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Isabella and the driver together, Darren couldn't help but feel </span><span>curious</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wondered how the two of them were together like that.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="73.html">« Prev</a><a href="75.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
