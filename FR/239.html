William whined, wearing a helpless expression.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin let out a snort and swiped the plate of ravioli right out of William's hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William got riled up in an instant. "Dad, what the hell are you doing? I haven't even taken my first bite yet."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin cocked an eyebrow. "Aren't you dating a girl? I heard she sends you grub every day. Go chow down on what your girlfriend brings. Don't butt heads with me over what Aurora brought."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William was left speechless. "This is the very first time Aurora's brought me food. You bet I'm </span><span>gonna</span><span> dig in. No one can hold a candle to Aurora."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William quickly snatched his plate back, worried his dad would make another grab for it. Then he quickly scooped up a spoonful and started wolfing it down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not one to back down, Benjamin took a quick munch. His eyes lit up right away. "This ravioli doesn't taste like it was </span><span>made</span><span> by our family's maid. I </span><span>gotta</span><span> say, it's pretty good."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William turned to Aurora. "Aurora, did you make this?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora shook her head. "No, it was Daisy. Oh, by the way, Daisy's our new maid."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't matter who made it. </span><span>As long as</span><span> it's from Aurora, it's bound to be a treat," Benjamin remarked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, yeah. Everything Aurora brings is top-notch," William chimed in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the father-son pair kept heaping praises on Aurora while tucking into their meal, Aurora felt a blush creep up her cheeks.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a knock sounded on the office door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William frowned. He loathed it when someone crashed their warm-and-fuzzy family time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who is it?" he barked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door was nudged open by a young </span><span>woman </span><span>in her mid-twenties with a round face, clutching a thermos.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora sat there, </span><span>stunned</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't because she recognized the girl. It was because she suddenly recalled what her dad had said about William having a girlfriend who sent him food daily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Could this be William's girl?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To tell the truth, the girl at the door wasn't hard on the eyes, but she wasn't a stunner either. She was on the short side and a bit on the plump side, and her fashion sense was </span><span>pretty run-of-the-mill</span><span>. She was just average.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that Aurora was looking down on her. She just figured William wouldn't be into this kind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora gaped at the girl at the door in disbelief, lost in her own thoughts.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman at the door clocked Aurora too.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she caught sight of Aurora's drop-dead-gorgeous face, her heart skipped a beat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Who is this woman?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why's she in the CEO's office?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Looks like she's thick as thieves with them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Could... could she be after Mr. William Barron too?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of this possibility made her grit her teeth. </span><span>Forcing down</span><span> her irritation, she spoke up to William, "Mr. William Barron, here's a home-cooked lunch </span><span>cooked</span><span> by Rebecca herself..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could even finish her spiel, William cut her off in a huff. "Take it back. I'm stuffed already."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman spotted the thermos beside William and narrowed her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Everyone in the Barron Group knows that Rebecca's been chasing after Mr. William Barron. And Rebecca's one of the biggest names in the entertainment scene right now. The 'Rebecca-William' ship is a fan favorite.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That hussy in there knows their deal but still tries to seduce Mr. William Barron. How shameless can </span><span style="font-style: italic;">she </span><span style="font-style: italic;">get?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Just because she's got a pretty face and looks </span><span style="font-style: italic;">young?</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> Is she trying to snag a rich hubby the easy way?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">She has no idea who she's up against.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After </span><span>a brief moment</span><span> of indecision, the woman reluctantly spun around and made her exit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the lounge, Rebecca Hansen was touching up her makeup when she saw her assistant come back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was taken aback. "Back so soon?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes landed on the thermos in the assistant's hand. </span><span>"Did </span><span>Will </span><span>eat</span><span> the food</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The assistant wrinkled her nose, looking thoroughly miffed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rebecca, Mr. William Barron didn't touch it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca was even more </span><span>perplexed</span><span>. "Wh</span><span>y</span><span>? Is he up to his neck </span><span>in</span><span> work and can't find the time to eat? If he's that swamped, you could've just left the thermos in his office. He'd </span><span>definitely dig</span><span> in when he's got a free moment. Why did you </span><span>take </span><span>it back here?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The assistant looked on the verge of tears. "Rebecca, when I got there, Mr. William Barron was right in the middle of a meal. And there was this woman in his office. She was a real knockout."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Rebecca shot out of her seat like a bullet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What was she like? Is she an employee at the Barron Group?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't seem like it. She wasn't wearing the work gear, and she seemed to be thick as thieves with Mr. Barron and Mr. William Barron."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Here, the assistant paused for a second and then continued, "Rebecca, you think she might be Mr. William Barron's fianc&eacute;e through an arranged marriage? I mean, it's par for the course for the high-society bigwigs to get hitched for business and status."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Rebecca gritted her teeth so hard it sounded like they might shatter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since she'd deliberately cooked up a fake relationship with William, her career in the entertainment industry had been on a real upswing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was completely head over heels for William. He was filthy rich and incredibly good-looking, and on top of that, as an heir to a wealthy family, he kept himself far away from all those shady goings-on. He was a real class act.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heirs of the four major families in Putnam were all in a league of their own.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, she'd had her eyes set on Julian, the heir of the Hawke Group. If she could marry into the Hawke family, she'd become a rich socialite without having to put up with a meddling husband's mother. It would be like a dream come true.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Julian was as cold as a polar bear and had a hard-edged side.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once, a woman had tried to come on to him and slipped him a roofie. But he'd managed to fight off the effects and went straight to the hospital. After the drug wore off, that woman who'd drugged him was sent packing overseas, and there'd been radio silence about her ever since.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Joe from the Hunter family and Oliver from the Mills family were said to be crazy about the mysterious genius princess of the Barron family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca thought of herself as a real hot commodity. At just 25, she'd already snagged the Best TV Actress award.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she was also realistic. No matter how big she'd gotten in the entertainment world, she was still just an actress.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast, the Barron family's princess was born with a silver spoon in her mouth and was a brilliant scientist. It was no wonder that Joe and Oliver were crazy about her. Rebecca knew she didn't stand a chance against her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After weighing all her options, William was the only one who still fit the bill.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she could marry William, she'd not only become a high-society dame but also have a genius scientist sister. Maybe she could even use that connection to hobnob with the elite.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, it was make-or-break time for her to break into the movie scene. She was banking on William to help her score the endorsement deal for the holographic helmet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then, out of the blue, some tramp is trying to steal William away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">William is so smitten with this woman that he didn't even touch the love-filled lunch I've slaved over.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca balled her fists.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That damn slut. </span><span>Just you</span><span> wait.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rebecca, what're we </span><span>gonna</span><span> do?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca let out a cold laugh. " We'll find someone to ruin that bitch. She's asking for it, trying to steal my man."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the father-son duo from the Barron family finished their meal, Aurora didn't hang around any longer. She grabbed the thermos and headed out of the company.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could hop on her electric scooter, some guys clapped a hand over her mouth and dragged her into a car.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once inside, a guy pressed a knife against her throat.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="238.html">« Prev</a><a href="240.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
