margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, she couldn't help but think Aurora's choice to send her to a mental hospital was brutally cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Aurora had wanted, there would have been countless crueler ways to deal with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Aurora had only sent her to a mental hospital, which, in a way, was an act of mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, Celeste might have ended up like Bertha, subjected to being toyed with by countless men in front of Joshua.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha had resisted and tried to escape multiple times, but each attempt brought her either a brutal beating or forced violation by the crude men in the village.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To stop her from running again, they even cruelly broke both her legs and locked her in a pigsty like an animal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From that day on, she became nothing more than a tool for their lust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, she got pregnant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one knew whose child it was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even then, the men showed no restraint, satisfying their urges on her day after day until she miscarried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her life became a cycle of beatings and violations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She became pregnant repeatedly, only to miscarry each time, trapped in an endless cycle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, even when the men stopped beating her, her body, ravaged by frequent miscarriages, developed a condition that made her prone to losing pregnancies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within a year, pregnancy and loss wore her down, her health crumbling before everyone's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha had always been proud, dreaming of a glamorous life, and vowing to marry the richest man she could find.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, she lived worse than a dog, violated by a pack of old, ugly, filthy men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The damage to her body and mind was unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than a year of hellish life, her spirit broke, and she descended into complete madness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, that was a story for later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back at the Hawke Estate, Julian set Aurora gently on the bed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spoke a few soft words of comfort before turning to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face stayed calm the whole time, but his ears betrayed him, glowing bright red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora watched his retreating figure, warmth filling her chest. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, her thoughts drifted to her deafness, her limp, and the missing kidney. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That sweetness quickly soured into pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clenched her fists tight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Maybe I should try getting some treatment. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What if I could actually get better?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If </span><span style="font-style: italic;">I could recover</span><span style="font-style: italic;">, I </span><span style="font-style: italic;">can</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> be with Mr. Hawke without </span><span style="font-style: italic;">any worries</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this realization, a spark of determination flickered in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back to his room, Julian headed straight to the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at his reflection in the mirror, with his ears flushed red, he could barely recognize himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recalling how he had kissed Aurora earlier to provoke Adolph, a faint smile crept onto his lips, impossible to hold back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his fingers to touch his lips, his eyebrow arching slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So this is what kissing feels like. Sweet, soft, and so smooth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was his first time experiencing a kiss, and it felt unexpectedly delightful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If I could feel it every day, that'd be perfect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Orley's prison, Barnett had long shed the air of a domineering CEO. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, dressed in a prison uniform with a shaved head, he wore heavy shackles on his hands and feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He approached forward slowly from a distance, the clinking of his chains echoing through the silent prison corridor, growing louder as he neared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He figured his visitors would be his parents or Bertha, but the last person he expected was Camille.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw her icy face, his heart raced, and his eyes darted away, avoiding hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The day she had woken up, he had already realized Aurora didn't harm her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he refused to admit it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, it was he who had confidently testified back then, accusing Aurora of attempted murder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had ruined his own sister's life, leaving her disabled, and he couldn't bear to face the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett wanted to escape, but when he met Camille's cold stare, he found himself walking toward her as if compelled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They sat across from each other, separated by thick glass, each picking up a phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence hung heavy, neither daring to speak first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camille broke the quiet. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Surprised to see me, huh? Too shocked to talk?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett dropped his gaze, his eyes unfocused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His guilty, defeated look didn't stir pity in her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, it only confirmed her view of him as an utter coward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you have anything to ask me?" she continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mustered the courage to meet her eyes, his lips trembling as he pieced together words. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I</span><span>'ve known everything</span><span>," he finally said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camille let out a sharp, bitter laugh. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned, sensing there was more behind her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she laid out the truth from five years ago, sparing no detail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She explained how Isabella had deceived Joshua, how Joshua had abandoned Aurora to an orphanage, and why, fifteen years later, he brought her back. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every detail spilled out, unfiltered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett listened, his fists clenching until they slammed against the glass. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Li</span><span>ar</span><span>! You're lying! You're trying to trick me!" he roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camille scoffed, "Tricking you? You're already in prison. Why would I bother?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I came here to make sure you know every rotten thing you did to Aurora. I have to tell you the truth. You hurt your own sister for Bertha's sake. Do you regret it now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regret didn't even begin to cover it for Barnett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart twisted like it was being carved open, the pain choking him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought that Bertha might have accidentally pushed Camille down the stairs five years ago and was too scared to admit it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he never expected that the truth was that Bertha and his father had plotted to take Aurora's kidney, harvest her organs, and donate her body as a medical cadaver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Camille hadn't overheard their plan by chance, Aurora would have died five years ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, Aurora hadn't escaped unscathed. She had been framed, beaten in prison for five years, and left broken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could this be?" he stammered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way! I don't believe it. You're just saying this to torture me, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lost it, pounding the glass, eyes bloodshot, roaring like a crazed lion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camille sat still in her wheelchair, watching him lose his mind with calm detachment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a furious yell, Barnett slammed his head against the glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two prison guards rushed in and subdued him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still struggled and yelled, "Let me go!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Find Aurora! I need to see her. I'll ask her myself!" He glared at Camille as he demanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camille smirked coldly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barnett, Aurora won't see you. It's time you felt what she went through in here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hung up the phone and wheeled away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes widened in panic. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Camille, don't go! I need to see Aurora!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she never looked back, not even as her figure disappeared from his sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett crumpled to the floor, muttering, "No way... I don't believe it. You're lying."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears streamed down his face as he whispered, "Aurora, I was wrong. Please, give me one more chance. When I get out, I'll spend my life making it right."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett was confessing his pain, but he had no idea that by the time he got out of prison, Aurora would have already disappeared from his life</span><span>.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="152.html">« Prev</a><a href="154.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
