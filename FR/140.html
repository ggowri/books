They used six sticks to break it. Can your half-hearted apologies make my leg whole again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her left calf was grotesquely twisted, the dark red scars resembling a fat, hideous centipede clinging to her skin. It was both ugly and terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After my leg was broken, no one treated me. They left me writhing on the ground in agony while they laughed at me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It took three agonizing months to heal on its own, without any medical attention."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Aurora spoke, Wilson and Lizeth were struck as if by lightning, collapsing to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she had received treatment, her legs wouldn't have been twisted like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even to the naked eye, it was clear that the bones in her leg had never been properly set, merely encased in layers of new tissue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, we know we were wrong. We are not asking for your forgiveness, only a chance to make amends," Lizeth pleaded, with tears streaming down her face. "Please, just give us a chance to atone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Wilson, a grown man, had tears in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camille, seeing the horrifying scars on Aurora's leg, burst into tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, it's all my fault. If it weren't for me, you wouldn't have suffered. Sorry, I&rsquo;m truly sorry. I can&rsquo;t express how guilty I feel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora took a deep breath, forcing down the resentment that had been bottled up for years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Camille and said, "You're a victim too. I don't blame you. I just want to know what really happened at Bertha's celebration banquet that day. You were her best friend. Why did she hurt you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the mention of that day, Camille clenched her fists, her hatred for Bertha palpable. She looked at Aurora with deep sympathy and began to recount what had happened five years ago at Bertha's banquet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, even Wilson and Lizeth, who had already heard the truth from Camille, trembled with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian, Beatrice, Ashley, and Daisy, who had known nothing about the incident, were horrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time Camille finished, they were ready to tear Bertha and Joshua to pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stood frozen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she had suspected that Bertha and Joshua targeted her for her kidney, she had never imagined the truth would be so much more horrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, Bertha and Joshua never intended to push Camille down the stairs. They planned to stage an accident in front of everyone, injuring Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once she was injured, they would rush her to the hospital and immediately declare her brain dead, regardless of her actual condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, as her father, Joshua would sign the organ donation papers, legally donating both Aurora's kidneys to Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that wasn't all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every usable organ, her heart, liver, corneas, would be donated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even her body would be donated as a cadaver for medical research, under the guise of contributing to science.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since it was Bertha's celebration banquet, all elites attended it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With them witnessing Joshua's selfless act, his reputation as a philanthropist would spread throughout the city and even the nation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only would Bertha be saved from kidney failure, but Joshua would also be celebrated as a saint, his career soaring to new heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the label, Joshua would gain the trust of </span><span>Elvador</span><span> Group's shareholders, pressuring Celeste to transfer her shares to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he controlled the company, he could drive Celeste to madness, claiming she had lost her mind from grief over her daughter's death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By staying loyal to his insane wife, he would further cement his image as a devoted husband, boosting his career.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he became the richest man in </span><span>Orley</span><span>, it would make Celeste&rsquo;s end. With her gone, he could marry Bertha's birth mother, Isabella, without any objections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Barnett, his capable son, he would continue to work for the company, unaware that he would inherit nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's will would leave everything to Isabella, Bertha, and his son abroad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett would spend his life working for the company, only to realize too late that he was nothing but a pawn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a five-birds-with-one-stone plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First, Bertha would be saved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Second, Joshua would become a celebrated philanthropist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Third, Celeste would be driven to madness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fourth, Joshua would marry Isabella.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fifth, Barnett would inherit nothing, unknowingly slaving away for </span><span>Elvador</span><span> Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the truth behind Bertha and Joshua's scheme.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would have gone off without a hitch, had it not been for Camille.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With so many guests at the banquet, the downstairs restroom was always occupied. Camille, who had a thing about cleanliness, didn't want to wait in line, so she went upstairs to find another restroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she was leaving, she overheard Bertha and Joshua's conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Bertha and Joshua saw Camille, their world seemed to collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Camille, hearing their plan, was equally stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha, whom she had always thought of as kind and gentle, and Joshua, whom she had seen as a wise and caring father, were actually monsters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Naively, Camille threatened to expose them in front of all the guests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in a panic, Bertha pushed her down the stairs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that was the moment Aurora had witnessed.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="139.html">« Prev</a><a href="141.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
