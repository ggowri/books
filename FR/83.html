Not long after, he appeared in Adolph's hospital room with the bag of money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph had just regained consciousness, with his head swathed in heavy bandages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing Ethan enter, he shot Ethan a gaze with undisguised disdain because he knew Ethan was Julian's man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he didn't fully understand Julian, one thing was clear: Julian was insufferably arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone like </span><span>him</span><span> would never apologize, even after a </span><span>fight and he was in the wrong</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His assistant's presence in the room couldn't bode well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph glared coldly at Ethan, his words dripping with contempt. "Did I invite you in? Get out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan remained unfazed, ignoring Adolph's hostility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He approached the bed with deliberate calm and emptied the bag, spilling ten neat stacks of crisp bills onto Adolph's bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a smirk, he picked up one of the stacks and waved it in front of Adolph. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is 'medical compensation' from Mr. Hawke. He said 100 thousand dollars should </span><span>be </span><span>more than</span><span> enough to</span><span> cover your expenses. Feel free to use the rest to buy some supplements. Maybe something to boost your brainpower."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph's face twisted into a shade of livid fury. His eyes blazed with indignation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The insult stung sharply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One hundred thousand dollars might be a considerable sum to some, but to Adolph, the scion of the Sherwood family, it was </span><span>just a small amout</span><span>, not even enough to buy the shoes on his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To think his injury was deemed worth a mere one hundred thousand dollars by Julian was a slap in the face. And that remark about "boosting his brainpower" was a blatant jab at his intelligence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rage surged through Adolph, his neck veins bulging as his face contorted with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seized the money from the bed and hurled it at Ethan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan, agile and composed, dodged effortlessly, the flying bills missing him entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Adolph's meltdown, Ethan felt a quiet satisfaction, though his expression remained impassive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan said, "Mr. Sherwood, there's no need for this. Mr. Hawke</span><span> means well</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His calm demeanor only highlighted Adolph's frenzied state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overcome by fury, Adolph attempted to lunge at Ethan, disregarding the pain from his wounds, but he stumbled and fell to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan couldn't help but chuckle at the sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seeing you so spirited, I'd say you're on the mend. Rest up. I'll be sure to let Mr. Hawke know you're not on death's door."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Ethan strode out, thoughtfully closing the door behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just before it shut, he shot Adolph a sarcastic grin. "See ya, Mr. Sherwood!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That infuriating gesture nearly sent Adolph over the edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent, save for his ragged breathing and the scattered bills, which were silent witnesses to his humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took a while for Adolph to regain his composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he hadn't seen who struck him, he guessed it was likely the woman Julian referred to as his fianc&eacute;e.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He whispered, "Their behavior was odd. </span><span>Why was Julian so nervous when I tried to see her face?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perhaps this woman can be the key to securing the East Suburb project."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dialed his assistant. "Look into Julian's fianc&eacute;e. I want every detail."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up, he found his thoughts drifted to Aurora. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It has been four or five days with no word from her. She's penniless and in poor health. Where could she have gone?" he murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought gnawed at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried calling Barnett, but the calls went unanswered. Frustration mounted as he repeatedly dialed, but each attempt was met with silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, Barnett! Why isn't he picking up?" Adolph slammed his phone onto the nearby table in a fit of anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, at the Elvador Villa, Barnett was in a sorry state, utterly intoxicated. The alcohol felt like a blade, slashing mercilessly at his stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, his stomach churned violently, the pain crashing over him in relentless waves. Each breath felt like a battle against jagged blades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was doubled over, clutching the toilet as he </span><span>threw up</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sweat beaded on his forehead, and his throat burned with each dry heave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His insides churned, threatening to expel everything within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the bout of vomiting, the agony in his stomach showed no signs of easing. It felt as though his guts were being twisted in knots, the pain nearly causing him to black out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett staggered from the bathroom. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His steps felt unsteady as he collapsed onto the couch. He curled into a ball, clutching his stomach and letting out a weak, raspy plea. "Aurora, my stomach hurts... medicine..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His parents, drawn by the commotion, entered to find a scene of disarray. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room reeked of alcohol and was littered with empty bottles, and Barnett lay on the couch, pale and drawn. His lips were colorless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste rushed to his side, gently stroking his forehead. "Barnett, why did you drink so much?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Barnett call for Aurora, Joshua scowled in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Aurora? What's so special about that girl? She can't hold a candle to Bertha. If it hadn't been for our need of her, I never would have brought her back from the orphanage eight years ago. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">A girl like her belongs in the slums, and not being sold off as a child-bearing tool is more mercy than she deserves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lashed out at Barnett. "Look at yourself! </span><span>You skipped your work just to get wasted like this?</span><span> </span><span>You wanna turn yourself into a total loser</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, </span><span>Barnett opened his eyes slowly. His gaze was a mix of pain, guilt, and despair as he looked at his parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, Dad, I'm hurting..." His voice was weak, each word a struggle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's eyes welled with tears. "You think we're not hurting? Look what you've done to yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett closed his eyes in anguish, tears escaping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he finally acknowledged Aurora's love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the three years she had cared for him, his stomach issues had vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after her imprisonment, the pain had returned, growing worse each year. Despite this, he drank heavily, as if punishing himself would somehow bring her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was wrong... I was </span><span>so </span><span>wrong..." he murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste, seeing his suffering, felt a pang of sorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She patted his shoulder gently, reassuring him, "It's okay. Don't blame yourself. She always longed for family love. She won't truly abandon us, and she'll come back once she's calmed down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Joshua remained unconvinced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured, "That wretched girl nearly killed us all. She hates us and isn't likely to return."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his disdain for her, he didn't wish her dead. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, her other kidney was still healthy. Who knew when they might need it again?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="82.html">« Prev</a><a href="84.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
