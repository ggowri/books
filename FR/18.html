"Did you do this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett sat up slightly, his hands casually folded on his legs. His expression remained calm, and he exuded an air of nobility. "Did I do what? I don't understand what you're talking about."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Was it you who had Lily expelled from school?" Aurora's voice seemed to be squeezed out through gritted teeth. "Barnett, I'm warning you. Leave Daisy and Lily alone, or..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He narrowed his eyes, a dangerous emotion in them, thinking, "She is overreacting just because of the daughter of a servant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She can be so caring towards outsiders, but she is so cold and mean to me, her brother. Is this reasonable?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Growing more and more resentful, he gritted his teeth and asked, "Or what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora said fiercely, "I'll perish with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett felt his heart hurt. "I'm your brother. Is this how you should treat me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora didn't answer, but the coldness in her eyes said it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two locked eyes, and the air was filled with tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the ringtone of a mobile phone shattered the silence. Barnett glanced at it and saw that it was Daisy calling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled at Aurora and answered the phone amidst her anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, Daisy's anxious and helpless voice came through. "Mr. Elvador, please help me. I had no other choice but to call you. Could you use the Elvador family's connections to prevent the school from expelling Lily? She's my only daughter. I've raised her with so much hardship. She's almost graduated from college. If she gets expelled now, her life will be ruined."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Barnett listened to Daisy's sobs, his eyes remained fixed on Aurora, observing her every reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora unconsciously clenched her hands into fists, her nails digging deep into her palms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy didn't even know that Barnett was the mastermind behind all this and was still naively asking him for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing the whole truth but being powerless to assist Daisy, Aurora could only place her hopes on Barnett once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora suppressed her anger and said, "Help her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett raised his eyebrows and covered the receiver with his hand. "I can help her, but you need to go and apologize to Camille. Once you get Adolph's forgiveness, Daisy's daughter will be fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's eyes reddened with anger, but she had no choice but to give in. "Fine, I promise you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her yield, Barnett didn't hesitate to say to Daisy, "Don't worry. Your daughter will be okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up the phone, Barnett stood up. "I'll drive you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No. I can take a taxi." Aurora refused flatly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can drive faster." Barnett persisted. However, Aurora's next words were like a stinging slap in his face, leaving him no room for dignity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said indifferently, "Just the sight of you makes me sick."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she turned around and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's face flushed scarlet, and the veins on his forehead throbbed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to suppress his anger but couldn't hold it back. In a fit of rage, he kicked the coffee table in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The coffee set was instantly knocked over. The delicate coffee cups shattered on the ground, and the coffee splashed everywhere, soaking the surrounding carpet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, don't go too far." He stared at Aurora's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett thought, "I have deliberately shown weakness in front of her. Why can't she be as submissive as before? Why does she have to confront me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora always knew exactly how to hit the most vulnerable part of his heart, making him ache, and she did it effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora didn't stop for a moment. Soon, she walked out of the Elvador Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the entrance of the house, she ran into Darren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren had the air of a nonchalant playboy. His gaze blatantly scanned Aurora from head to toe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Your face is swollen, and you're limping. You look so pitiful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how pitiful Aurora looked, no one would show her any pity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora ignored him and walked past him indifferently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren frowned in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since he was Barnett's friend, whenever he came to the Elvador Villa in the past, Aurora would be bustling around like a servant, serving him coffee or water with great enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now... Such a drastic change made Darren feel rather uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Hey, where are you going? I can give you a ride."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora still didn't pay him any attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her indifference immediately piqued Darren's competitive spirit. He caught up with Aurora and grabbed her wrist. "I'm talking to you. Are you deaf?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora calmly said, "Mr. Lowell, if you wish, you can consider me not only deaf but also mute. As long as it pleases you, you can think of me however you want. I only have one request. From now on, don't talk to me, and treat me like air. Okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... I haven't offended you. Why are you acting so crazy?" said Darren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just consider me crazy." Aurora forcefully pulled her hand back and walked away without looking back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are sick," shouted Darren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora didn't give him a response anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren stood there stunned, looking at her limping back. Thinking about the dreadful injury on her leg, he felt extremely uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora pushed open the VIP ward where Camille was in the Orley Central Hospital and stood still by the bedside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman on the bed was completely different from what she remembered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the daughter of the Sherwood family, Camille had been used to be sweet-looking, fashionably dressed, and as lovely as a doll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, she was like a withered leaf in the autumn wind. Her plump muscles had vanished, leaving only a layer of pale skin wrapped around her bones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cheeks were sunken, and her cheekbones were prominent. Her limbs were like emaciated branches, with all the muscles atrophied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Camille like this, Aurora couldn't help but feel sad, and her heart began to ache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora and Camille hadn't had a good relationship. It was Camille who had unilaterally disliked and targeted Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason was simple. Camille and Bertha had grown up together and were very close friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camille's understanding of Aurora was solely based on what Bertha had told her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora didn't know what Bertha had said to Camille, but she was certain it wasn't anything good. Otherwise, Camille wouldn't have been so convinced that Aurora was bullying Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even now, Aurora couldn't figure out why, despite being good friends, Bertha had pushed Camille downstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was even more puzzled as to why Joshua, who was right beside Bertha, had allowed Bertha to commit the act and then framed it on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had been unlucky. She had happened to be at that place at that time, witnessed their attempted murder, and was seen by Celeste, who arrived at the scene immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Precisely because Camille and Bertha were good friends, Barnett and Adolph hadn't believed that Bertha would harm Camille.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They both thought that it was Aurora who was framing Bertha.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="17.html">« Prev</a><a href="19.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
