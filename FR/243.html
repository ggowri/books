The ceremony was a whirlwind of joy, sealing their bond with promises of a shared future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly after, Aurora made an unexpected detour. She went to prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't bothered visiting Joshua, Bertha, and the others since they got thrown behind bars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, with her Institute move coming up and no clue when she'd be back, she figured it was time to </span><span>face them</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This, she sensed, might be their final encounter. After all, they'd all been sentenced to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before their executions, she wanted to see her enemies brought low, to honor the Aurora of her past life, who'd suffered so much at their hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the prison's stark visiting room, Aurora first came face-to-face with Joshua.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd braced herself for his hatred, expecting eyes that burned with venom, yearning to tear her apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man behind the thick glass looked like he'd aged decades overnight. However, his gaze, to her shock, carried not rage but guilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was something else in his eyes, a flicker of paternal warmth. It was as if he were a father looking at his daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora narrowed her eyes, a suspicion taking root.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She picked up the phone, and Joshua mirrored her, his trembling hand clutching the receiver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could speak, his voice, raw and unsteady, crackled through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, I'm so sorry. It's all my fault. I never should've hurt you for Isabella and her wretched daughter Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know I was wrong. Can you ever forgive me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora let out a sharp, mirthless laugh at his heartfelt plea. "So that's it. If I'm not mistaken, Joshua, you've remembered our past life, haven't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's face crumpled, heavy with remorse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since his imprisonment, he'd endured daily beatings, and with each blow, memories of his past life had surfaced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now he understood the agony Aurora had suffered in prison, tormented and broken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cursed himself for not remembering that sooner, for not realizing the truth the moment Aurora was </span><span>re</span><span>born.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hated that it took a jail cell to open his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, it was </span><span>all </span><span>too late. Condemned to death, he could never make amends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why did fate let me remember... Just to punish me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears of regret streamed down his face as he looked at Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know my sins are terrible. I don't ask for much... Just your forgiveness. Please, Aurora, can you give me that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze was ice-cold, unyielding. "Forgive you? You don't deserve it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm kinder than you ever were, Joshua. Here I am, visiting you in prison. In my past life, you threw me into a cell for five years, and not </span><span>even </span><span>one of you ever came to see me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Compared to</span><span> that</span><span>, I'm practically a saint."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mocking words pierced Joshua's heart, each one a fresh wound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't you forgive me, just this once?" he pleaded. "I'm about to die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Death is what you earned," Aurora shot back, her eyes glinting with scorn. "What, you think you can guilt me into pity at the last second?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You made my life a living hell in our last life. I'd rather you paid for it forever. This is only your second life, so why should I forgive you now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just dropped by to see you hit rock bottom, Joshua.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And knowing you're getting the special treatment in here? That's enough for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You used to tell me five years in prison was no big deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, go on, and experience it yourself. Not everyone gets to savor the taste of a cell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When you're done, you can face your end. And if there's another life after this, I'll still wish you nothing but suffering, forever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's eyes widened, his body trembling as her merciless words sank in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora hated him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew his crimes were monstrous, but in his past life, paralyzed by a stroke and abandoned in the wilderness, he'd endured torment he thought had balanced the scales.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed he'd paid his debt to Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't fathom why she </span><span>still </span><span>refused to let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This life, too, had cost him dearly. He was sentenced to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surely, he believed, that was enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't know why she cursed him to eternal suffering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sobbing, he begged, "Aurora, I've learned my lesson. Why can't you forgive me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I paid for my mistakes in our last life and this one. Isn't that enough?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the next life, I swear I'll be a </span><span>proper </span><span>fathe</span><span>r</span><span>. Please, </span><span>just </span><span>believe me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Aurora's heart was stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forgiveness?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wouldn't give him that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wouldn't give him a chance to escape from the punishment he deserved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her, wounds didn't fade with time. They scarred and etched deep into her soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would never forgive, not in this life or any other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a faint, bitter smile, she said, "Joshua, your word means zero to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You used to say I was mean to Bertha because I was just born evil. Well, let me flip that back on you. Someone as messed up as you? You could live a hundred lives and still be trash. And trash like you deserves everything coming to it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I won't be," Joshua cried, desperation in his voice. "Aurora, I'm begging you, give me a chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Aurora had already set the phone down. She</span><span> </span><span>turned and walked away, not sparing him another glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua pounded on the glass, frantic, but she never looked back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never saw her again, not even before his execution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Isabella, Frank, and Bertha, their days were a relentless cycle of abuse from fellow inmates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha, already weakened by kidney disease, didn't survive long enough for her execution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was beaten to death by prisoners, her ears deafened, her eyes blinded by needles, her limbs and ribs shattered, and her skull caved in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lay in a pool of blood, memories of her former life playing like a film reel in her broken mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time her family cursed or beat Aurora, Bertha </span><span>just</span><span> stood nearby, smug and triumphant, looking down on her like a queen watching a fallen servant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The images fueled her bitterness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want to die. She believed she was supposed to be the victor, the one adored and centered in everyone's world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't understand how it had all gone so wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no amount of resentment could save her. Bertha died, consumed by regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella and Frank, physically tougher, endured daily beatings right up until the eve of their executions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora checked on everybody who did her dirty except Barnett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fake self just made her sick, acting all nice while plotting against her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even looking at him felt like a stain on her soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So she just cut him off completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Aurora stepped out of the prison, ready to climb into her car, she froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of people w</span><span>ere</span><span> being marched in by police, and at the front was a young man with garish yellow hair, dressed in cheap, flashy clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He exuded the careless swagger of a street thug, the kind who lived for trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's</span><span> </span><span>breath caught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that face all too well.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="242.html">« Prev</a><a href="244.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
