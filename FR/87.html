"Mr. Sherwood, what happened to your head?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph hesitated briefly before dismissing it casually. "Just a clumsy bump. What's going on with Barnett?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The image of Barnett coughing up blood flashed through Joshua's mind. His eyes turned icy with rage.</span><span> Then he started cursing Aurora without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all Aurora's fault!</span><span> That brat!</span><span> Who knows what poison she spewed to make Barnett spit blood?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That bitch can't stand to see our family thrive. Even after being cast out, she stabs us in the back</span><span>!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face twisted with anger, like blaming Aurora could somehow wipe away what they did to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste nodded sadly. "Aurora</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s just a letdown, like a curse on this family. All she does is bring us pain. Now she</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s put Barnett through so much. It</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s terrible. </span><span>She simply doesn&rsquo;t give a damn about us</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph listened in silence with an unreadable gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes hinted at deep contemplation as he weighed the truth in their words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His stance remained neutral. Like a silent observer lost in thought, he stood there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sudden, mocking laugh shattered the quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a raspy sound that jarred in the still corridor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste and Joshua, along with Adolph, turned to see a nurse pushing Camille in a wheelchair towards them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste and Joshua froze, their pupils dilating with terror and panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bravado they'd shown moments ago vanished, replaced by dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's face blanched, beads of sweat trickling down his forehead. Celeste felt an invisible grip on her heart, her body recoiling as her eyes were wide with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew the truth of the past all too well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua had witnessed Bertha push Camille down the stairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Celeste hadn't seen the fall, she'd ignored Camille's pleas for help and swiftly blamed Aurora, who was too stunned to react. "Aurora, why did you harm Mr. Sherwood's sister?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was also at her prompting that Bertha and Joshua got their stories straight, adamantly insisting that Aurora had attempted murder with malicious intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, Celeste had deleted the surveillance video that could have </span><span>prove</span><span> Aurora</span><span>&rsquo;s innocence</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guilt gnawed at them, and seeing Camille revived only intensified their </span><span>fear</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua, seasoned in the cutthroat world of business, quickly composed himself, though his eyes betrayed a hidden unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste, accustomed to a life of leisure since marrying Joshua, was overwhelmed by fear when she was faced with the sight of a fully awakened Camille.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice trembled as she asked, "W-what do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camille's laughter ceased abruptly, making her eerily indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five years as a vegetable had drained her of color. Her cheeks were hollow, making her eyes appear unnaturally large and eerie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph hurried to her side with evident concern. "Camille, you shouldn't be out here. Your body hasn't fully recovered, so you need rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camille shifted her cold and penetrating gaze to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Camille, what's wrong?" Adolph's voice wavered with uncertainty as he tried to decipher her expression, but her face remained indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been less than a week since Camille woke up, and her physical functions were still far from fully recovered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camille had pushed herself to regain speech, driven by the need to clear Aurora's name and expose Bertha as the true culprit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her own brother, Adolph, had never once asked who had caused her coma. The irony stung.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had, she could have communicated the truth by blinking or nodding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, it was Bertha who hurt Camille, who yearned for Adolph to avenge her and see Bertha imprisoned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Adolph never inquired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man who once cherished her had become a stranger, willing to protect her </span><span>enemy</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart felt shredded, each piece bleeding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her lips twisted into a chilling smile, and with immense effort, she croaked one word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Retribution!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was faint yet piercing, echoing in the silent corridor like a blade stabbing at everyone's hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She erupted into a manic laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her eyes, Adolph, Barnett and Hubery all got injured because they had it coming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She believed that those who had hurt Aurora would get the punishment they deserved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it was only the beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camille</span><span>&rsquo;s grin looked creepy, now that she got worked up.</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph's face darkened with fury and frustration. He couldn't strike out at his own sister, so he lashed out at the nurse. "Take her away! She's too weak to be causing a scene here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nurse hastened to comply, pushing the wheelchair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camille slumped, unable to resist, but her eyes remained fixed on Adolph, brimming with loathing and hatred like arrows aimed at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had so much she wanted to say, yet she could only echo, "Karma! Karma..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph's head pounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything he'd done to Aurora was for Camille, yet it </span><span>had earned her enmity</span><span>. He couldn't fathom how it had come to this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood, watching Camille disappear down the corridor, but her animosity lingered, suffocating him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long while, the emergency room doors opened. Darren, looking drained, removed his mask. "Barnett had a gastric perforation but is out of immediate danger. He'll need to stay for observation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste and Joshua breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Celeste soon sobbed. "This is all Aurora's doing. If not for her, Barnett wouldn't be suffering like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren's patience snapped as he scoffed, "Stop </span><span>lying to</span><span> yourselves. Aurora is the victim. Barnett's suffering due to his own guilt and remorse. If you truly care for him, reflect on how you've treated Aurora all these years."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he left them gaping and returned to the emergency room to bring out Barnett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, in another room, Hubery was wheeled out with his leg heavily bandaged.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="86.html">« Prev</a><a href="88.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
