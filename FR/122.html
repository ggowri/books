His usually deep and sharp eyes were now filled with complex emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Aurora and opened his mouth, but he found his throat dry. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how many words of comfort he might come up with, they all seemed so feeble and inadequate in the face of this tragic truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel also lowered his head, unable to bear to watch any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, Aurora's laughter subsided, finally turning into a long sigh, as if she wanted to expel all the grievances, pain, and unwillingness of the past twenty-odd years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Celeste, don't you always say I am a </span><span style="font-style: italic;">curse</span><span style="font-style: italic;">? Now, it seems that your beloved husband</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> is the curse</span><span style="font-style: italic;">. Everything you've suffered is because you misjudged people and fell in love with a scumbag like Joshua.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I wonder how you'll feel when you find out that your biological daughter was abandoned by the husband you love, your kidney was removed and transplanted into your husband's mistress' body under his instigation, and the daughter you doted on </span><span style="font-style: italic;">was the illegitimate daughter of your husband and his mistress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora closed her eyes. Involuntarily, the image of Celeste's heartbroken expression when she learned the truth emerged in Aurora's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, an indescribable sense of pleasure welled up in Aurora's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She slowly opened her eyes and raised her hand to wipe away the tears streaming down her face. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze once again focused on the stack of documents in her hand, which seemed to weigh a thousand pounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes scanned the words. In an instant, her face, which had been slightly pale from crying, turned red in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had always thought that the Elvador family's current huge business empire was built by Joshua through his extraordinary abilities and efforts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she had never imagined that Joshua was merely Celeste's husband and had nothing to his name in the beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora thought Joshua had turned bad after having an affair, for the sake of his mistress and their illegitimate daughter, Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the information told her otherwise. Joshua was just a scumbag who had been plotting to get Celeste's family properties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste was the only daughter of the Jerome family, a prominent family in Orley, and had been doted on since childhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua, on the other hand, was a college student who had struggled his way out of a poor mountain village. His mother had disappeared after giving birth to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After being admitted to Orley University of Technology, Joshua set his sights on Celeste, the wealthy heiress who could change his fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The</span><span>ir</span><span> </span><span>encounter</span><span> and falling in love with each other were all masterminded by Joshua.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's father, Zorro Jerome, who had been in the business world for decades and had seen countless people, saw through Joshua at a glance and knew he was not a good match for Celeste, so he firmly refused to allow the two to be together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Celeste, who was deeply in love, lost all her rationality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be with Joshua, she, who hadn't graduated yet, became pregnant with Joshua's child and was determined to be with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helplessly, Zorro had to compromise and agree to their marriage on the condition that Joshua </span><span>had to listen to whatever he said after joining</span><span> the Jerome family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua agreed on the surface, but he felt it was a great humiliation </span><span>deep down</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to live the life of the upper class he had always dreamed of, he could only endure this humiliation and bury his hatred deep in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Joshua's son was born, Zorro forcefully demanded that the child take Celeste's surname.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua was filled with hatred but had no way to resist. He could only play some tricks secretly to stir up trouble between Celeste and Zorro.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Zorro embarrassing Joshua again and again, Celeste felt more and more sorry for Joshua. She even promised that if she gave birth to a second child, it would take Joshua's surname.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua agreed verbally. But in his heart, he was filled with resentment towards </span><span>everyone in the Jerome family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his opinion, everyone in the Jerome family looked down on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This pent-up frustration and resentment grew deeper and deeper in his heart. He desperately longed to be recognized and respected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Isabella was like a "beam of light" that illuminated his twisted inner world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua indulged in the excitement of having an affair with Isabella, especially right under the nose of Celeste, which made the sense of excitement even more intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Isabella's pregnancy was his deliberate doing, just to disgust the people of the Jerome family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Celeste's second child had been a boy, Joshua might not have abandoned </span><span>them</span><span> </span><span>in the orphanage. After all, it was the one who could carry on the Elvador family's bloodline and had his surname.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the second child was a girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore,</span><span> Joshua made a snap decision to take Aurora away and abandon her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he brought Bertha, Isabella's child, home in the name of adoption and gave her to Celeste, who had just lost her beloved daughter, to raise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time he saw Celeste doting on Bertha as if she were her biological daughter, Joshua felt a twisted sense of pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Celeste gave birth to Aurora, her kidney was removed, and she could no longer conceive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In order not to let the Elvador family die out, Joshua went so far as to push Zorro off a construction building when Zorro was checking the situation and then carefully faked the scene of a fall from a height.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua took the opportunity to take over the Jerome Group and renamed it the Elvador Group. He even changed Barnett's surname from Jerome to Elvador.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The loss of Aurora, coupled with Zorro's sudden death, was like two heavy bombs that completely shattered Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her health deteriorated day by day, and she gradually became unable to cope with the company's affairs. From then on, she stayed at home and rarely </span><span>take care of the company&rsquo;s affairs</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, since Joshua only had Barnett as a son, he still paid some attention to Barnett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when Isabella became pregnant again and gave birth to a boy, everything changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua suddenly found Barnett, who had the blood of the Jerome family in his veins, extremely annoying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To pave the way for Isabella's son, Joshua secretly made Barnett the legal person of the company, planning to let Barnett take the blame if anything went wrong with the company in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha inherited Isabella's kidney disease, and Joshua thought of Aurora</span><span>, who could be useful</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought that since Celeste's kidney could be transplanted into Isabella's body, Aurora's kidney should also be able to be transplanted to Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the real reason Joshua brought Aurora back from the orphanage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To carry out this plan smoothly, he didn't hesitate to frame Aurora and send her to </span><span>prison. After all, in his eyes, no one would care if a prisoner's kidney was removed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the years, Joshua had quietly cashed out the company's assets and transferred them all to Isabella's name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, he had planned to cooperate with the Hawke Group, make a fortune, and then shift all the debts to Celeste and Barnett. He would then fly away with Isabella, Bertha, and his son and settle abroad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, the cooperation with the Hawke Group fell through, and he was beaten and had his leg broken. All his plans had to be put on hold for the time being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The information on the second page was like a nightmare, completely shattering Aurora's perception of how cruel Joshua could be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He's simply a devil. Zorro was brutally killed by him. Celeste was deprived of a kidney and had to raise Joshua's mistress' child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Barnett was tricked into becoming the company's legal person and is now trapped in prison, facing accusations of embezzlement of public funds and tax evasion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And I, because of him, have my future ruined and am left with lifelong disability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the thought, </span><span>Aurora tightly clenched the documents, her fingernails digging deep into her palm, leaving several blood marks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her,</span><span> Joshua </span><span>wa</span><span>s</span><span> far</span><span> </span><span>worse than a beast."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were filled with raging anger and hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Celeste and Barnett were detestable, they were victims of Joshua's schemes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two and Aurora were each more miserable than the other, yet only Joshua was still at large, having received no punishment at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was not willing to let this go</span><span>.
