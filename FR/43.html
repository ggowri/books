"Dad, calm down. Let's talk this through."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua glared at Aurora, his eyes burning with rage. "Let go of me! I'm going to teach this disrespectful brat a lesson she'll never forget!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett held Joshua back with all his strength, preventing him from getting anywhere near Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora shot Joshua an icy stare, her expression one of utter disdain for this so-called father of hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This old man never learned. She'd nearly scared him to death with a knife last time, and now just a few days later, he was back at it, thinking he could lay a hand on her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could feel the intense animosity emanating from Joshua. It was different from the dislike Celeste or Barnett had for her. This came from deep within, pure, unfiltered loathing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was her biological father, but every time he saw her, it was as if he were looking at an enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Aurora's cold gaze, Joshua snapped, "Apologize to your mother and Bertha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apologize? Why should I apologize?" Aurora shot back, her voice calm but firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's eyes widened with veins popping in his neck. "You hurt Bertha, and you made your mother cry. Don't you think you owe them an apology?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hit Bertha because she deserved it. As for your wife crying, it's because she's done too many shameful things. That has nothing to do with me," Aurora retorted, her voice biting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's body shook with fury, and he lunged toward her again. Barnett held him tighter, desperation in his voice. "Aurora, can't you just shut up for once?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora crossed her arms, sneering. "So when your dad wants to hit me, I'm not even allowed to talk back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora." Barnett frowned, disapproving. "He's still your father."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora scoffed coldly, "My father died a long time ago. I'm an orphan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's fury reached a boiling point, his face reddening as his hands trembled in anger. His eyes bulged, and his neck veins were practically bursting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a trembling finger pointed at Aurora, he yelled, "You bring nothing but disaster! Ever since you came back, this family has been in chaos. You're here to ruin us, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's lips curled into a cold smile as she snapped back, "I don't think I'm the one who deserves that compliment. In fact, I think you fit it much better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you hadn't been passed out like a dead pig back then, completely ignoring me as a newborn, I wouldn't have been stolen and turned into an orphan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you hadn't adopted Bertha, I wouldn't be here getting manipulated by her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The chaos in this family is all because of you, yet you blame me for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not only are you a disaster, but you're also a spineless coward."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's words hit Joshua like daggers, each one sharper than the last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The years of pent-up resentment and frustration poured out of her, and it felt so satisfying to finally let it all go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua, the chairman of Elvador Group, was used to being on top, surrounded by people who admired him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At over fifty, he looked fit, tall, and completely devoid of any signs of age or indulgence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this man, so highly regarded, was now being publicly insulted by his own daughter, and it made him choke with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His chest heaved, his breathing shallow, as he gasped for air, unable to form a coherent sentence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you..." Joshua sputtered, his mouth open but no words coming out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? If I were you, I'd have no face to show up in public after losing a child like that. But you? No guilt at all, still alive and well, and you still have the nerve to hit me. What gives you the right? Just because you're older?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora continued her tirade, not holding back anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they wouldn't let her live in peace, she'd make sure none of them would have it easy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste, hearing Aurora's harsh words, gasped and covered her mouth, her face a mixture of fear and panic. She shrieked, "Aurora, how can you talk to your dad like that? This is too much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha stopped crying, peering out from behind Celeste, muttering under her breath, "Aurora, how can you curse Dad like that? You're so ungrateful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora almost laughed out loud. "I'm the one being unreasonable? Ungrateful? Look at yourselves and ask if you even deserve to be called family. How have you treated me all these years? Have you ever considered me part of the family? You get what you give. Got it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua was beyond enraged now, his bloodshot eyes wild with fury. He looked like a bull ready to charge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He broke free from Barnett's grip and swung a fist at Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, neither Celeste nor Barnett stepped in to stop him. They stood by, coldly watching, as if they wanted Joshua to teach her a lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Joshua's fist was about to land, Daisy rushed forward, stepping in front of Aurora. "No, Sir! Don't hit her! She's hurt!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua roared, "Get out of the way! I'm going to beat this ungrateful little brat to a pulp!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he swung his fist toward Daisy's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy closed her eyes, bracing for the impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But, to her surprise, the punch never came.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She slowly opened her eyes, confused, and saw that Aurora had somehow pulled out a shiny wallpaper knife, the tip pointed directly at Joshua.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's eyes were as cold as ice, and her grip on the knife was steady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There wasn't the slightest tremor in her hand. If Joshua dared to make a move, that knife would go straight into his fist without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air seemed to freeze, and everyone gasped in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's anger was still burning, but now there was a hint of fear in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the second time Aurora had pulled a knife on him. How dare she?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stared at him coldly, as if she wanted to tear him apart. "Go ahead, try it. You wanted to hit me, didn't you? Let's see if your fist is faster than my knife."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had found the knife in the utility room, slipped it into her pocket for self-defense, and never imagined she'd be using it so soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's rage was like fire, but there was nothing he could do. His chest heaved with labored breaths, his face turning purple as if he were suffocating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His breathing grew even more difficult, and dizziness overtook him. His heart raced, and soon, his limbs were numb. With a thud, he collapsed to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste, Barnett, and Bertha were all horrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Joshua, what's happening? Don't scare me!" Celeste rushed to his side, shaking him in panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha, truly crying now, turned to Aurora with a look of pure hatred in her eyes. "It's all your fault! You did this to Dad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora simply didn't care. In fact, she looked almost amused, her eyes still smiling coldly as she watched the scene unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy, equally shaken, asked, "What's happening to him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora, unfazed, replied, "He's suffering from respiratory alkalosis due to excessive ventilation. It's caused a primary drop in H2CO3 concentration or PaCO2, leading to an increase in blood pH."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy blinked, not quite following. "What does that mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Respiratory alkalosis," Aurora answered flatly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy, though aware of Aurora's intelligence, was still shocked. "What do we do now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora shrugged, unconcerned. "What can we do? If you guys can treat him, great. If not, he can die for all I care."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="42.html">« Prev</a><a href="44.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
