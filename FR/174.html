She wrapped her arms around Julian, stopping him cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shook her head&mdash;a silent "don't"&mdash;before turning to face Hubery with the smuggest little smile. "Go ahead and say whatever you want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery expected her to squirm, maybe even look guilty. He'd played this scene out a dozen ways in his head, but not like this. Aurora just stood there with this look that screamed, "Yeah, I'm trading up for someone with deeper pockets. Die mad about it." Cool as ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her indifference lit a fire in him. Rage boiled up from deep within, so intense he wanted to lunge at her, grab her shoulders, and shake her until she snapped out of this "pathetic" act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he couldn't. His legs were gone, leaving him stranded in that wheelchair, forced to watch helplessly as Aurora clung to Julian, flaunting their closeness right in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery trembled with anger. His hands gripped the armrests so hard his knuckles turned white as if he could crush the metal beneath his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Aurora wasn't </span><span>gonna</span><span> waste her breath on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her, Hubery was yesterday's trash. His BS didn't mean squat anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this dipshit didn't get the memo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time she blew him off, he went more psycho.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery was used to being her everything. Used to Aurora breaking her back to keep his worthless ass happy, sending him every dirty dollar she scraped together. Having her kiss the ground he walked on had turned him into a straight-up narcissist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now his meal ticket was gone. Aurora's love, her attention - all that sweet stuff belonged to someone else. And it was eating him alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swallowed the fury churning inside him, forcing his voice to steady as he tried a softer approach. "Aurora, you won't find happiness with a guy like him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've never been out in the real world. You don't know how cruel people can be. Rich guys like him? They don't care about women. To them, you're just toys."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused, eyeing her up and down with a sneer. "You need to know your place. You've been to prison, and you're a cripple. What makes you think a rich man would want you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's only nice to you because he's never messed around with someone like you, a crippled novelty. Once the thrill wears off, he'll toss you aside like trash."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's tone softened further, his eyes glinting with a fake show of "affection."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We grew up together, Aurora. We're both orphans, unwanted and unloved. You're crippled, and I've lost my legs. We're the perfect match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you forgotten how good I was to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he watched her closely, putting on a mask of sincere concern. But in truth, he was just trying to tear her down, to keep her under his thumb with his twisted manipulation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora let out a sharp, mocking laugh. "Good to me? You mean setting me up and throwing me in jail for no reason is your idea of 'good'?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your version of 'good' was always chewing me out over Bertha? You knew who I was, but you never listened. Instead, you just kept stacking lies on top of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you dare compare us, Hubery. I'm nothing like you. I'm not an ungrateful snake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I'm crippled. But even so, I still wouldn't look at you twice." Her brutal words hit him like a sledgehammer, each one smashing into his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery felt his blood pressure spike. His vision blurred, and his breathing turned ragged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, how can you be so blind? I'm saying this for your own good. If it were anyone else, I wouldn't bother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked at him with pity, like he was some kind of sad joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it were anyone else, they would've slapped you silly for talking like that. The only reason I don't bother is because I don't want to dirty my hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hubery, let's make this the last time we ever cross paths. If we meet again, don't even think about talking to me. Every word you say makes me sick&mdash;literally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trust me, I'm not kidding. I can't stand you so much that just looking at you makes me want to puke."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Aurora turned away, grabbed Julian's </span><span>arm</span><span>, and walked off without a backward glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's grip tightened on his wheelchair, his body shaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He watched them walk away, bitterness welling up inside him. He knew he'd lost her, but his possessiveness wouldn't let him accept it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl who was once head over heels for him just walked away without a second thought, right into another man's arms. It ate away at him, filling him with resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Aurora was carrying another man's child, even if she was "tainted," he still couldn't bring himself to let her go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His teeth clenched as he squeezed the file folder in his hands. It was his ticket back to power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He landed a divorce case, representing a sales manager from Hawke Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he won, he</span><span> would</span><span> help his client take every last cent from his wife, earning himself a cool million dollars in fees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Better yet, he</span><span> could</span><span> have a new connection to lean on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He </span><span>was sure to</span><span> crush that pretty boy by Aurora's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, just you wait," he muttered under his breath, his voice dripping with madness. "I won't let you slip away that easily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora and Julian walked side by side down the street, their shadows stretching long under the streetlights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Julian stopped. He gently took her shoulders, turning her to face him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked up. The glow of the lamps bathed him in a golden halo, softening the usual hardness of his face into something tender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't listen to him," he said. "You've always been amazing to me. I'm not just messing around with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, he got close to her because his grandmother adored her, and he was fed up with fending off clingy women. Keeping her around seemed like an easy fix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as time went on, being with Aurora started to change him. She gave him a sense of peace and comfort he didn't realize he was missing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was quiet, gentle, kind, and genuine. Everything about her drew him in, making him want to stay close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora blinked, caught off guard. A warm feeling swelled in her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew he was trying to lift her spirits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled up at him, "I'm not bothered by what Hubery said."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd heard those kinds of insults so often they barely registered anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, one thing Hubery said stuck with her. She couldn't shake the thought that a deaf, crippled wreck like her didn't deserve someone like Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Acid churned in her gut as she dropped her gaze, trying to hide the storm in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Gotta </span><span style="font-style: italic;">speed</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> up my embroidery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I need to get my kidney back and take Lily and Daisy far away from here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more time she spent with Julian, the deeper she fell. Each moment with him was like quicksand - the harder she tried to pull away, the more stuck she became.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she wasn't stupid. Drawing this out would only make everything hurt worse in the end. Better to rip off the Band-Aid now, while they both still had a chance at walking away in one piece.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe if she bailed early enough, he'd have time to forget her. Then when her time finally ran out, it wouldn't destroy him completely.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="173.html">« Prev</a><a href="175.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
