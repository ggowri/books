"Aurora, this is way too risky."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora waved it off like it was nothing. "That's exactly why I need your help. All I'm asking is that you give the cops a ring if I get snatched. That's not rocket science, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, it wasn't exactly a tall order, but Celeste wasn't willing to roll the dice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From her past run-ins, she knew just how ruthless Joshua and Isabella could be.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was afraid that this time, they'd manage to take one of Aurora's </span><span>kidney</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, I&mdash;" Celeste started.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? You're backing out?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste quickly shook her head. "I'm not backing out. I just don't want you to end up </span><span>getting hurt</span><span> again."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora let out a sneering laugh. "It isn't about whether you're on board or not, is it?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste, looking utterly perplexed, asked, "What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your precious son sees me back in the picture. You really think he won't spill the beans </span><span>to</span><span> Joshua and Bertha?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's eyes widened in sudden dread, and she vehemently shook her head. "No way</span><span>. </span><span>Barnett wouldn't do that."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Barnett had been rough on Aurora, Celeste still had faith that he wouldn't stab his own sister in the back, especially since they </span><span>were well aware that</span><span> Bertha was the fruit of an affair.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think I'm lying?" Aurora sneered. "Well, why don't you </span><span>go</span><span> outside and see what Barnett's up to?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste still hung back, dead-set on the idea that Barnett wouldn't do anything to harm Aurora.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her heart was pounding like a drum.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quietly, she cracked open the study door a smidge. She didn't even have to step out; Barnett's voice from the living room came through loud and clear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, have you found a kidney for Bertha yet?</span><span> </span><span>Not yet? What gives? How hard can it be to find a match?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I </span><span>gotta</span><span> tell you something. Aurora, the one who went missing for eight years, is back. She's right here in our house, jawing with Mom in the study.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? You think Aurora's kidney might be a good fit for Bertha? You want me to haul her to the hospital for a donation?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But knowing her, I know she'd never go for it. She can't stand our family.</span><span> </span><span>Alright. Don't sweat it, Dad. I'll see to it that she gets to the hospital."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up the phone, Barnett just stood there in the living room, deep in thought for what seemed an eternity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he mumbled to himself, "You can get by with one kidney. Bertha's health is on the fritz. If she doesn't get that transplant soon, she's a goner. Aurora would just be out of a kidney, but Bertha would lose her life.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, while Dad was wrong to put Aurora in an orphanage, if he hadn't, she wouldn't have been adopted by the Barron family and lived like a princess. So</span><span>,</span><span> he deserves some credit for that."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Barnett clearly favored Bertha and wanted to take Aurora's kidney, he didn't want to be seen as the villain, so he concocted all these justifications to harm Aurora.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste heard it all, and for a moment, she nearly lost control, almost charging out to confront Barnett.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How could I give birth to such a brainless son?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Aurora ended up in an orphanage, and you think that's good luck for </span><span style="font-style: italic;">her?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her previous life, Aurora had suffered terribly, supposed to be cherished and nurtured like a delicate flower, but had instead withered away far too soon due to Joshua's cruelty.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste finally cottoned on to what Aurora had meant earlier.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was spot-on. Whether she was out for revenge or not, Barnett was bound to spill the beans about her situation to Joshua.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how they'd lived their lives, it seemed her kidneys were always earmarked for Isabella.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given Joshua's cut-throat nature, he'd managed to take Aurora's kidney in the past. There was no question he'd cook up something just as dirty this time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of shame washed over Celeste, and she dropped her gaze. "Aurora, I'm really sorry. It's </span><span>my bad</span><span> for not keeping your brother in line."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora fell quiet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett had always been two-faced, in this life and the last.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time he hurt her, he'd put on a sad act afterward, making it look like he really cared.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To the outside world, it seemed he was heartbroken for his sister.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in reality, he'd</span><span> never shown her an ounce of kindness, just endless humiliation, mockery, and disdain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Jerome, will you give me a hand?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste nodded stiffly. "Alright, you have my word..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hesitated for a second, locking eyes with Aurora, her own eyes brimming with hope. "Aurora, if I help you out this time, will you think about coming back home and living with me?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll make sure you get the biggest and swankiest room. You won't ever have to stay in that storage closet again."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora let out a mocking laugh. "Ms. Jerome, you're really pushing it. You think I'm just </span><span>gonna</span><span> brush off all the crap you've pulled on me over the years out of the goodness of my heart? And then you want to keep me trapped in this god-awful </span><span>Elvador</span><span> Villa?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think this place hasn't done enough damage to me?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me set you straight. Every single brick, every beam, every blade of grass in this house is like a slap in the face. I've never felt even a smidge of family love here, just your never-ending, crazy-making humiliation."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Celeste listened, memories of the past came flooding back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could clearly see all the times Aurora had been tortured, and each memory felt like a dagger to her heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on," Aurora said </span><span>all of a sudden</span><span>, her expression softening.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I shouldn't say I never felt any family love. At least Daisy really cared about me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just thinking about Daisy made Aurora's heart warm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In my past life, I always dreamed of growing up and making it big so I could buy Daisy a huge house and let her live out her golden years in comfort.</span><span> </span><span>But it never happened.</span><span> </span><span>This time, I think I </span><span>can make that happen</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste clenched her fists tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It hurt her to see her own daughter preoccupied with the thoughts of a servant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The feeling of being overlooked was excruciating&mdash;she longed to have Aurora look her way.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste couldn't help but wonder if Aurora had felt the same way in her past life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only through personal experience could she grasp the depth of that pain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, I'm so sorry."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora merely wore a smirk, leaving it </span><span>unclear</span><span> whether it was a sign of gratitude or mockery.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've said what I needed to say. I should be on my way now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you really leaving?" Celeste's heart sank at the thought.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since</span><span> awakening all those years ago, she had been preoccupied with thoughts of Aurora.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And seeing her now, looking just like she did in their previous life, stirred a longing in Celeste to shower her with love and make amends for the debts of the past.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="230.html">« Prev</a><a href="232.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
