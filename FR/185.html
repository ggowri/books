His old man beat the shit out of him daily, screaming his head off, starving him whenever he felt like it. When he </span><span>shit</span><span> himself? Just left him there to rot in his own filth&mdash;completely ignoring any father-son bond they might have had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Aurora now, he clung to her like his last hope, swallowing his pride to beg for mercy from his daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked down, meeting Joshua's pleading gaze. A </span><span>sneer</span><span> spread across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What makes you think I'd ever take you home, Joshua?" she asked coldly. "Is it because you dumped me at an orphanage? Or maybe because you cut out my kidney for Bertha?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice grew icier with each word, every syllable cutting into Joshua's heart like a knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You heartless monster. </span><span>You destroyed your wife and kids without blinking. All this shit you're dealing with now? You earned every bit of it." Her lip curled in disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Real rich that you've got the balls to ask me for favors now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Aurora kicked Joshua hard, sending him sprawling to the floor with blood trickling from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Joshua seemed immune to pain as he continued to beg Aurora, mumbling incoherent pleas for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stood her ground, watching him struggle on the floor without a hint of sympath</span><span>y</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I told you. I came here to see you and Bertha suffer with my own eyes. Now that I have, I can finally move on with my life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pure terror filled Joshua's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, he couldn't stay here. He needed to leave. He wanted to go home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He desperately wanted to say, "Aurora, can't you forgive me? I was tricked by that bitch Isabella. It's all Isabella and Frank's fault." But no matter how many words crowded his </span><span>mind,</span><span> he couldn't force any of them out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora shifted her gaze from Joshua to Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha looked like a drowned rat&mdash;pathetic, yet still baring her teeth at Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora flashed her a small smile. "Bertha, my kidney's been in your body long enough. Don't you think it's time you gave it back to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha may or may not have understood, but when she met Aurora's cold, merciless stare, she froze. Then, her body started to shake uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She scrambled backward, half-crawling, half-rolling, until she retreated all the way back into the pigpen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Aurora </span><span>wouldn't let </span><span>her</span><span> off</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced up at the sky. </span><span>The perfect sky had turned gloomy, thunder growling like it meant business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone who'd hurt her got what was coming to them&mdash;even worse than what they'd done to her. She finally felt like she could breathe again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel got antsy. "Mr. Hawke, storm's coming. Let's grab Bertha and </span><span>leave</span><span> before we get soaked."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian nodded and shot Daniel a look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel caught his meaning immediately. He strode over to Joshua's father, his voice ice-cold and uncompromising. "The key to the chains. Now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intimidating presence he radiated made the old man struggle to breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing these people weren't to be messed with, the old man quickly pulled out the key and handed it to Daniel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel grabbed the key and stormed into the pen, making quick work of the locks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He snatched that chain like it was nothing, yanking Bertha out of that nasty pig pen like she was headed to the chopping block.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha sensed the danger and fought like hell to break free. But she was wasted away to nothing now, no match for Daniel's raw power. With him dragging her like some junkyard dog, all she could do was crawl forward, fighting every inch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian crouched in front of Aurora again, his voice soft. "Aurora, come on. Climb on my back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Aurora didn't hesitate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their group made their way along the winding, muddy path toward the exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's eyes remained fixed on Aurora while </span><span>weird</span><span> sounds spilled from his mouth. </span><span>Snot and tears streaked down his face, mixing with dirt until he looked like a total train wreck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he could cry a river for all she cared&mdash;Aurora didn't give him a second glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's father, irritated by his son's crying, grabbed a broom from the yard and swung it at him. "I'm not dead yet, what are you mourning for, you miserable piece of shit?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beating was so brutal that Joshua passed out cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did the old man drop the broom, breathing heavily. He glanced at Joshua's motionless body on the ground and snorted with disgust, showing zero interest in whether his son lived or died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, fat raindrops began hammering down. The rain came suddenly and violently, and in the blink of an eye, everything was shrouded in sheets of water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The downpour intensified. Within minutes, Joshua was soaked through, lying pathetically in the mud while the rain washed over his battered body. Nobody came to check on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Daniel struggled forward, pulling Bertha along with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha stumbled through the mud, her nails splitting and palms rubbing raw as she struggled forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian carried Aurora on his back, his boots splashing through puddles with each step. He wasn't sweating getting soaked himself, but he was worried about Aurora catching something in this mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This rain couldn't have come at a worse time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With no shelter in sight, they were stuck between a rock and a hard place. Their only option was to keep moving forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rain blurred their vision, making the mountain path even more treacherous. The sky erupted with lightning and thunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a deafening crack split the air as lightning struck a massive tree dead-on. In an instant, the tree turned charcoal black.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's eyes widened as she witnessed the strike, a knot of dread tightening in her stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawke," Daniel called out, "we need to pick up the pace. We're surrounded by trees. It's dangerous out here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The narrow, rugged mountain terrain made it impossible for vehicles to access, forcing them to leave their car at the base. Now, walking was their only way out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian tightened his grip on Aurora and quickened his pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rain hammered them like bullets while thunder and lightning lit up the sky like a war </span><span>zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then this weird rumble started rolling in from somewhere far off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel, an ex-special forces soldier with extensive wilderness survival experience, caught that death signal instantly. His face went white as a sheet as he shouted, "Mr. Hawke! MOVE! LANDSLIDE!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could even finish yelling, a wall of mud, rocks, and trees came crashing down the mountain like a freight train from hell.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="184.html">« Prev</a><a href="186.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
