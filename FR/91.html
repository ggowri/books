Its plush pink cover featured bold letters reading: [Aurora's Special Seat].</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hanging from the rearview mirror was a photo of her lounging in the sunlight on the couch at the Hawke Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the photo, her face was serene. Though her expression was neutral, the image radiated contentment and happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora felt a wave of emotion as she looked at all the personal touches meant just for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes grew misty as she ran her fingers over the soft, plush material of the seat cover, feeling the warmth and thoughtfulness behind every detail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She remembered her first ride in Barnett's car after exiting prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His car had been filled with traces of Bertha everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, she had worn cheap jeans and a T-shirt. Her entire outfit probably cost less than Bertha's designer dress bag handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had felt so worthless then, never imagining a day someone would treasure her this much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan seemed to notice her emotional </span><span>turmoil</span><span> and said warmly, "Madam Hawke set all this up herself. Do you like it, Ms. Elvador?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was surprised but quickly </span><span>grabbed the whole situation</span><span>. While Julian was good to her, he would never deck out his car in such a girly pink style.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, it was unbelievable that Julian let Beatrice have her way with his car and even allowed her to claim the passenger seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora gently touched her gown and softly said, "I love it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the first time she had worn a formal gown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was also her first time wearing something expensive and beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would never again feel out of place like before, wearing cheap clothes in luxury cars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The contrast couldn't be more obvious. The Hawke family cared so much about her. In contrast, the Elvador family couldn't care less.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it didn't matter anymore since she had already left the Elvador family behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan looked at Simon, standing motionless at the mansion's entrance. "Simon, get in the car already."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon pouted with reluctance. "I don't want to watch Julian get all lovey-dovey with some girl."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan rolled his eyes but still tried to reason with him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're Ms. Elvador's stylist today. What if her makeup needs touching up? Mr. Hawke specifically had you brought over from Putnam because you're the only one he trusts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon's face lit up instantly</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a proud attitude, he declared, "Well, if it's Julian's wish, I suppose I'll have to agree."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he strutted to the car on his long legs, swaying his hips dramatically as he opened the passenger door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could take the seat, Daniel interrupted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, but this seat is reserved for Ms. Elvador. Please sit in the back." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Aurora hadn't been wearing an evening gown and looking so stunning, Daniel would have already invited her to take her designated seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon froze momentarily, shot Daniel a dirty look, reluctantly slammed the passenger door, and plopped down in the back seat in a huff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the car pulled away, an awkward tension filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon was still sulking, stealing glances at Aurora from the corner of his eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora could only respond with an awkward smile at his behavior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan couldn't help but chime in, "Come on, Simon. Quit pouting. Remember, your job is to ensure Ms. Elvador's makeup stays perfect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon crossed his arms and declared, "Of course! When I'm on the job, I guarantee our girl here will look flawless until the party's over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora couldn't help but laugh at Simon's dramatic attitude, feeling the tension melt away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said softly, "Thank you so much for all your help today, Simon. I would've been lost without you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon's stern expression softened at her words, and a slight smile tugged at his lips though he tried to maintain his aloof facade. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph, at least you know talent when you see it. Don't worry, your pretty head! Just follow my lead, and you'll be the belle of the ball."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora gazed out the window at the passing scenery, her heart filled with anticipation as the car cruised smoothly along the road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A black Rolls-Royce approached like an elegant panther, gliding closer until it stopped at the hotel entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car's sleek body reflected the surrounding lights, radiating luxury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the doors opened, curious onlookers had already gathered around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel stepped out first, walking confidently to the car's rear to open the back door with practiced efficiency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon was the first to emerge, swaying his hips as he stepped out dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He put on an aloof expression, but the excitement in his eyes was impossible to hide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Simon's appearance had already drawn attention, it was merely the opening act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Ethan came around from the other side, extending his arm with gentlemanly grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A delicate, porcelain-like hand emerged slowly from the car, gently resting on Ethan's offered arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd held their breath at the sight of that hand, eagerly waiting to see the owner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes were on Aurora as she gracefully stepped out of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sunlight bathed her in a golden glow, creating an ethereal aura around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few loose strands of her elegantly styled hair fell around her smooth neck, dancing in the breeze and adding a playful touch to her appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wore a pink floor-length gown that hugged her curves perfectly. The sheer fabric offered tantalizing glimpses of her silhouette, and the hem swayed with each step like flowing clouds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her features were stunning, perfectly arched eyebrows, bright, clear eyes, a straight nose, and lips as delicate as rose petals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was a masterpiece, as if sculpted by a master artist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers </span><span>were rooted</span><span>, their eyes wide and jaws dropped in amazement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The usually bustling hotel entrance fell completely silent as everyone focused on Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time seemed to </span><span>have stopped</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel carefully lifted the train of her dress, taking care not to create a single wrinkle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group slowly made their way into the hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes</span><span> followed their movement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua and Celeste, standing among the crowd, couldn't believe </span><span>they</span><span>'d run into Aurora at an event like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua glared at her with murderous rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He should have known she would never stay </span><span>low-key</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they forced her to marry Julian, she verbally agreed. Still, her face showed reluctance, and she acted like a pure, innocent maiden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at her now, she was nothing but trashy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She just couldn't wait to throw herself at him, dressed up like that. She was obviously trying to seduce Julian at the party!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, perhaps Julian wasn't her only target. She was probably after every wealthy heir at the party!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This shameless woman had some nerve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste, however, had a different take on the situation than Joshua.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Celeste hadn't thought that far ahead, seeing Aurora didn't bring her joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her brows remained tightly furrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Aurora ran away from home, Barnett had drowned his sorrows in alcohol until he developed a stomach ulcer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste herself had spent every day worried sick about Aurora's wellbeing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they had been sick with worry, here she was, not only living her best life but showing up at Beatrice's birthday party dressed to the nines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Enraged</span><span>, Celeste stormed over without a word and slapped Aurora hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She screamed, "Aurora, you ungrateful </span><span>brat</span><span>!
