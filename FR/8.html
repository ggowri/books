I said stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora spun around at the sudden grasp on her arm, her eyes widening before hardening when she recognized him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't meant to blank him&mdash;her left ear was shot from that first brutal year in prison, and the repeated beatings had messed up her right one too. These days, unless someone was right in her face, their words were pretty much lost on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back off," she snapped, yanking her arm away, her eyes fixed anywhere but on him. "Just... let me go, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's your problem?" Barnett snapped, his guilt morphing into rage. "It's Bertha's birthday, for Christ's sake! You already made a scene at the party, and now you're just gonna bail? Grow up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look," he sighed. "The doctor just confessed</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>he admitted you paid him to fake your injuries. This whole victim act, these lies to get sympathy... I'll let it all slide."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He yanked her arm harder, ignoring her struggle. "Get inside. Now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His grip was crushing, and Aurora felt her bones might snap any second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get off me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'd rather freeze to death on the streets than spend another second in this house!" Aurora spat back, mustering what little strength she had to wrench away from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words hit Barnett like a physical blow, and something snapped inside him. Rage clouded his judgment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You coming back or what?" he snapped, kicking her leg. He'd meant it as a warning tap, but Aurora crumpled to the ground with a scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She curled into herself, clutching her leg, face drained of color. Sweat beaded on her forehead as tears poured down her face, each breath coming out as a pained gasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, I barely touched you!" Barnett's voice cracked, the words sounding hollow even to him. "Stop being dramatic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my god, Aurora!" Daisy dropped beside her, hands hovering helplessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain in her arm sent Aurora spiraling back to that hellish second year in prison. Those faces-twisted with hate, snarling like animals&mdash;were burned into her memory. The reason for the beating had faded, but those wooden bats? Those she'd never forget.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd kept swinging until six bats splintered, her legs shattering beneath them. Her pleas for mercy only made them hit harder. Their ringleader had yanked her head back, breath hot against her ear. "Try running to the guards. See what happens. You've messed with the wrong guy. This is just a taste."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, trapped in that flashback, Aurora felt the nightmare wasn't over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God... it hurts..." Aurora could barely speak, curling into herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I barely touched you," Barnett mumbled, his confidence wavering. "Why are you...?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy shot him a glare before gently rolling up Aurora's pant leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight knocked the breath from their lungs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her leg was a nightmare&mdash;the bone twisted sideways like a broken twig. Old scars mapped her skin like a web, mixing with angry red welts and half-healed wounds. The leg itself was skeletal, wasted away to almost nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett felt the blood drain from his face. He stood there, rooted to the spot, as reality crashed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of this was more shocking than the injuries he saw at the banquet...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This... this can't be right," he whispered hoarsely. "She was healthy before prison. How could five years..." His voice died as understanding dawned, horror spreading across his features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Prison wasn't just a place for punishment. For an eighteen-year-old girl, it was a hell where monsters roamed freely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart broke, shattering into countless pieces. His eyes reddened, and he clenched his teeth to suppress the anguish threatening to overwhelm him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, Barnett bent down and scooped Aurora into his arms. He burst through the villa doors, heart pounding, only to freeze in the living room. The harsh reality struck him&mdash;he didn't even know which room was Aurora's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shame twisted in his gut. Years under the same roof, and he knew nothing about her life here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath to steady himself, he turned to Daisy. "Where's her room?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This way," Daisy whispered, her voice trembling as she walked ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett followed, growing more uneasy with each turn. He'd never ventured this far into the house's forgotten corners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Daisy pushed open the door, his heart stopped. It wasn't a room&mdash;it was a glorified closet. Damp walls, random junk crammed everywhere, and wedged in the middle, a narrow bed. No window, no ventilation, just darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This..." he choked out, "this is where Aurora sleeps?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="7.html">« Prev</a><a href="9.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
