"You... you dare to kill?" Her voice cracked, each word filled with pain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily blinked innocently. "That's right. I've already killed six people. One more won't matter. You messed with the kid I care about most, so you're done." Her tone was light, as if taking a life was as trivial as swatting a fly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To the woman, Lily's words were devilish whispers. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Doubled over in pain, she clutched her stomach, blood seeping through her fingers. "Please</span><span>... </span><span>my son</span><span>... </span><span>he</span><span> just turned one</span><span>. He needs me&mdash;"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily was merciless, twisting the knife deeper with each word. The woman's screams were raw and desperate, chilling to the bone. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's gaze was icy. "Your </span><span>kid</span><span> is young, and mine isn't? Whether your </span><span>son</span><span> has a mother is none of my business. Hurt someone I care about, and you pay with your life."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman begged, on the brink of collapse. "Don't kill me! I'm sorry. I'll make it right! I'll treat Jen</span><span>-trash</span><span> like my own!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dare call her Jen-trash?" Lily snapped. That was the last straw. She pulled out the knife and slit the woman's throat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman fell with a thud, gasping, her limbs jerking in a grotesque struggle. Blood bubbled from her throat, eyes wide with terror. In the end, fear and despair won, and she took her last breath.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's dagger, still slick with blood, gleamed in the sunlight. She wiped it on the woman's clothes, then turned to the child, who sat trembling, tears streaming down her face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the woman, Lily was a cold-blooded killer. But facing Aurora's daughter, her fierceness melted away. Her gaze softened, her voice gentle. "Sweetheart, don't be scared. No one will hurt you anymore."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The child, shaken by the bloody scene, could only stare. "Who... who are you, miss?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily reached out, stroking the child's thin face. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The resemblance to Aurora was uncanny, especially how Aurora looked when she got out of jail&mdash;skin and bones, her eyes large and innocent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears slipped from Lily's eyes. "I'm... your birth mother's sister. You can call me Aunt Lily."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Birth mother?" The child pointed at the dead woman. "Wasn't she my mommy?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily shook her head. "No, sweetheart. She wasn't your mother. She was a human trafficker."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The child's eyes lit up instantly, her fear vanishing. She smiled, "Aunt Lily, </span><span>c</span><span>an we go see Mommy now? I don't want to stay here anymore. Everyone here hates me. They don't give me food. I'm so hungry."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's tears spilled over at those words. She pulled the child into a tight embrace.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The child was just as pitiful as Aurora.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she hadn't found her, her life would have been a carbon copy of Aurora's.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's heart raced with fear. "Ye</span><span>ah</span><span>, sweetie, I will take you away. We're leaving right now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily </span><span>scooped</span><span> up the child and was about to leave when a man burst in. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the woman lying dead on the floor, he yelled, "Did you kill my wife?</span><span>!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He noticed the child in Lily's arms and sneered, "Where are you taking that little brat? Think you can just kill someone and walk away? Not on my watch! Help! Murder!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The child started trembling in Lily's arms as soon as she saw him and whispered, "Daddy..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's anger spiked at the child's words. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This man must have hurt her too, or she wouldn't be so scared.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily stepped toward the man, but a crowd of villagers rushed in, blocking the doorway. They all started shouting, "Don't let the murderer escape!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's got a knife!"  </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone call the cops!"  </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing he had backup, the man regained his courage and moved toward Lily, trying to snatch the child. Lily held the child with one arm, knife in the other, ready to strike. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden wail of approaching sirens cut through the chaos.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In one fluid motion, Lily set the child down and yanked the man backward, her knife finding his jugular.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't move, or this knife won't show mercy," Lily said, her voice low and icy.  </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man trembled. "I... I won't move. Just don't kill me."  </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Police swarmed the perimeter, their shouted commands slicing through the night air. "Drop the weapon! Now!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's breath came steady. This was always how it would end. Aurora's tormentors were dust&mdash;this was victory enough. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced down at the trembling girl clinging to her leg like a lifeline.  </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily smiled gently. "Sweetie, don't be scared. No one can hurt you anymore."  </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The child sensed the danger, tears streaming down her face. "Aunt Lily, are they the bad guys coming to get you?" She pointed her little hand at the police.  </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily almost broke down in tears at the child's protective words. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She held back the tears and shook her head. "</span><span>Sweetie</span><span>, </span><span>those are</span><span> police officers. They'</span><span>ll protect you</span><span>. Let go of me and go to them, okay?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="197.html">« Prev</a><a href="199.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
