Five years behind bars because he couldn't speak up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All thanks to Hubery Winston's sorry self.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, Aurora went full hustle mode&mdash;working her fingers to the bone, entering every competition she could find, throwing every dollar at his law school dreams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And how did he thank her? Used her like a stepping stone, building his fancy career by throwing her under the bus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His first act as a rising star was to betray her, ensuring she was locked away in prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past life</span><span>, Hubery had reveled in years of splendor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lived in a multimillion-dollar penthouse in Orley's bustling heart, cruised in a luxury car worth a fortune, and dressed in </span><span>numerous </span><span>tailor-made suits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From his polished exterior to his curated demeanor, he radiated the aura of an elite, every detail crafted by wealth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in this life, stripped of Aurora's support, Hubery had grown into nothing more than a petty thug, aimless and insignificant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the police led him away in handcuffs, Aurora stopped one of them. "Officer, what's he in for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most people wouldn't get an answer, but Aurora was the country's golden child, the state's pride and joy. So the</span><span> officer</span><span> gave it straight, "Public debauchery."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's breath hitched, her face flashing with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Public debauchery?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So, w</span><span style="font-style: italic;">ithout my help, Hubery's no better than a speck of dirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, any trace of interest in him vanished. She could tell he was just a worthless figure, forever banished from her world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she turned to </span><span>leave</span><span>, Hubery's voice rang out, desperate and ragged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on! Don't I know you from somewhere?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora glanced back, her eyes meeting his for a fleeting second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression remained calm, almost indifferent. "Someone of your status didn't deserve to know me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their fates had flipped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery was no longer the renowned Orley lawyer of her past life, just a broke, powerless delinquent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she was no longer the scorned, neglected daughter of the Elvador family. She was the adored princess of the Barron family, Julian's fianc&eacute;e, a prodigious genius, and a pioneering scientist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this life, her many titles formed an impenetrable shield, ensuring no one could dare to harm her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Aurora slipped into her car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the vehicle pulled away, Hubery felt a pang of loss, as though something irreplaceable had slipped through his grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze clung to the ca</span><span>r</span><span>, a wild urge to chase after it surging within him. But bound by shackles and flanked by officers, he could only stand rooted, watching her leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His best years were doomed to waste away behind bars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time raced forward, and ten years passed in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was now twenty-seven years old.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, she'd only lived to twenty-three, her body and spirit broken by the Elvador family's cruelty, her life snuffed out by poison to shield Lily from blame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this life, she vowed to never let death claim her so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At twenty-seven, Aurora had blossomed into a woman of striking elegance. Her tall, graceful figure and captivating charm turned heads, blending sophistication with an effortless warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the past decade, her research had consumed her, leaving little time for visits home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, after a major breakthrough in her work, she could finally take a real break.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than that, she was preparing to marry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's wedding was a spectacle, drawing luminaries from the realms of commerce and politics, their presence lending the event an air of grandeur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only blemish was the weather. There was a steady rain that blanketed Putnam that day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, that was fine. The ceremony unfolded within the lavish halls of Celestia Palace, a luxury hotel, where the rain couldn't dim the celebration's brilliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The venue buzzed with guests, their excitement palpable as the event drew near.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearly everyone had arrived, filling the space with chatter and anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy, however, was a bundle of nerves, pacing restlessly as she dialed Lily's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, Aurora's wedding is about to begin! Why aren't you here yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm almost there, Mom," Lily answered, her voice tight with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood at a bus stop, her face etched with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For ten years, Aurora's words of encouragement had been her guiding light. Lily had thrown herself into her studies, graduating with top honors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through relentless effort, she'd secured a coveted position at the Science and Technology Research Institute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the Institute was sprawling, and with Aurora immersed in a different field, their paths seldom crossed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their packed schedules left little room for catching up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That day, a critical research task had held Lily back, delaying her until the last moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she'd finished, she'd rushed out, only to be caught in the downpour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sheltering under the bus stop's awning, she fumbled with her phone to book a ride, her fingers moving with frantic haste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After about ten minutes, a sleek black car rolled to a stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without glancing at the license plate, Lily sprinted through the rain, flung open the passenger door, and slid inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, take me to Celestia Palace," she said, catching her breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan, who'd just leaned down to grab his phone, looked up to find a stranger in his front seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman wore a simple white T-shirt and blue jeans, her hair pulled into a neat ponytail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rain had left her bangs and lashes glistening with droplets, and her damp T-shirt hugged her frame, tracing the delicate curves of her figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's eyes lingered, a spark of recognition flickering in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt as though, on another rainy day, a girl just like her had sat beside him in this very seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared, caught in the strange familiarity of the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily, noticing the car hadn't budged, shot him an impatient glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was dressed in a tailored black suit, his features sharp and undeniably handsome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, can you hurry, please?" She pressed. "My friend's getting married at Celestia Palace, and I'll miss the wedding if we don't get moving."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan blinked, shaking off the haze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only wedding at Celestia Palace today was Julian and Aurora's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Could she be a friend of Ms. Barron's?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze swept over her again, catching the work ID hanging around her neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">A</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> researcher at the Institute, likely a colleague of Ms. Barron.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Her name's</span><span style="font-style: italic;">...</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> Lily?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The name stirred something deep within him, familiar yet elusive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Oh my, she mistook me for her Uber driver</span><span style="font-style: italic;">?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A spark of amusement lit his eyes. He raised an eyebrow and turned the key, the engine purring to life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his black Maybach glided away, another car pulled up to the bus stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's phone buzzed. She answered, and an irritated voice snapped, "You said you were at the bus stop!

You jumped into someone else's ride? Come on, you could've told me! Cancel the order yourself." The driver hung up, clearly annoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily turned to Ethan, </span><span>clearly confused</span><span>. "Wait, you're not my Uber driver?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's lips curled into a teasing smile.
