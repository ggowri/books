He looked like he might drop his jaw to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, he was mentally rolling his eyes. </span><span style="font-style: italic;">"Mr. Hawke, the cold, aloof man who is as emotionally distant as they come, completely impervious to the charms of women, is playing it so wild and spicy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan couldn't help but think about Julian's grandmother, who had been fretting over Julian's lack of interest in marriage, sighing all the time. The old woman had already turned gray from worry. But now, seeing this scene unfold, wasn't it a "surprise" of a lifetime?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sly grin, he pulled out his phone, snapping a quick photo, the sound of the shutter barely audible. His fingers swiftly typed a message and sent the picture to Julian's grandmother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan imagined her reaction&mdash;she would laugh herself silly when she saw this. His grin only widened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he basked in his mischievous delight, he saw Julian's hand move sharply, landing a precise blow to the back of Aurora's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One second, she was writhing restlessly in his arms, and the next, she went limp, her body going completely still.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's excitement instantly evaporated, and his face froze in complete confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"Wait, what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't supposed to happen!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasn't the correct sequence supposed to be the aloof CEO scooping up the heroine with one hand, opening the car door with the other, gently laying her down in the leather seat, and then following her inside to continue their passionate moment in the spacious back of the car...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Based on his years of reading romance novels, this was supposed to be the way things unfolded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So why the hell did Julian knock her out?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan blinked in disbelief, only to meet Julian's icy gaze. "Got enough of a view?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan jolted back to reality, trying to recover his composure. He smiled sheepishly and stepped forward, about to brief Julian on the handover of the east district property. But as his eyes casually glanced at Aurora's face, he couldn't help but blurt out, "Wait... Ms. Savior?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know her?" Julian raised an eyebrow, clearly surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, she's the girl who embroidered on your suit," Ethan replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's eyes narrowed as he recalled the intricate embroidery on his jacket. "So it's her." His thoughts drifted for a moment, his gaze lingering on Aurora's unconscious face as he considered the implications.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The east district project was vital for expanding Orley's commercial reach, and the suit he wore had been custom-tailored for high-profile events like auctions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he never imagined the fabric would be deliberately damaged&mdash;though he suspected the rival families bidding against him were the culprits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Repairing a high-end custom suit was a delicate and difficult task, one that only skilled hands could handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected much, but the embroidery on his chest had been a pleasant surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The needlework looked strangely familiar, almost identical to a piece he'd bought at auction a year ago for 30 million dollars. It had been a gift for his grandmother's birthday.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His grandmother had loved it, especially since she adored embroidery, and Julian had planned to buy more from the same artisan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was told there were only two works by that particular artist in existence&mdash;he'd bought one, and the other, a more intricate piece, was left unfinished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The artist had mysteriously stopped working on it a month ago, and Julian couldn't help but wonder if something had happened to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe... the artist died?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawke?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian snapped back to attention, looking from the embroidered flower to Aurora in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If her embroidery skills were as impressive as he thought, perhaps he could ask her to finish the piece. He could present it to his grandmother as a birthday surprise this year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He carefully lifted Aurora into the car, realizing she might have been drugged. "To the hospital," he instructed firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Aurora woke up again, she found herself in a hospital room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The burning heat she'd felt earlier had finally subsided, and her mind was clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the memories of the evening came flooding back, especially Bertha's cruel actions, a wave of rage surged within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She swung her legs over the side of the bed, determined to leave the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan, after handling the admission paperwork and buying some essentials, returned to the room to find it empty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half an hour later, Aurora hailed a cab and returned to the Elvador Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she stepped through the door, she was met with a barrage of insults from Joshua. "You ungrateful wretch, how dare you come back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could steady herself, a cup flew at her, crashing to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's fury reached a boiling point. "How dare you dodge it? I'll teach you some manners, you disrespectful brat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha feigned concern, stepping in to calm things down. "Dad, please, let's all just stay calm. I'm sure Aurora didn't mean to."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She pushed you at the banquet and embarrassed you in front of everyone. She did it on purpose! She can't stand seeing me happy, and she wants to hurt us, the Elvador family!" Joshua was beside himself. "Aurora Elvador, kneel down right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora glared coldly at the father-daughter duo, her back straight, eyes burning with intensity as she fixed her gaze on Joshua.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was icy and without a hint of warmth. "Why should I kneel? It was Bertha who drugged me at the banquet, trying to ruin me. But instead of confronting her, you're blaming me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha's eyes instantly filled with tears, and she choked out, "You pushed me and made me look foolish in front of everyone. I can forgive that, but you can't just accuse me without any proof!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua, furious at Aurora's rebuttal, screamed, "You're still trying to argue? Bertha has always been sweet and obedient&mdash;she'd never do such a thing! If you don't apologize to her today, I'll show you what discipline means!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste, standing off to the side, hesitated for a moment before reluctantly backing Joshua's words. "Aurora, just apologize. Don't make things worse."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett also frowned. "Aurora, you went too far today. Apologize to Bertha."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's eyes roamed over the familiar yet cold faces before her. The hatred inside her surged to the breaking point, erupting like a volcano.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the years of restraint, all the anger, poured out in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes turned bloodshot, filled with a madness that seemed to consume her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're all on her side, pushing me into a corner! Fine, fine!" Aurora's voice was low and feral, her body trembling with raw emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they wouldn't give her justice, she would take it herself</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a furious roar, she lunged forward, grabbing the ashtray from the coffee table. She shoved Bertha to the ground and brought it down hard on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha's scream echoed through the room, her eyes wide with terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora, her heart filled with rage, kept striking Bertha again and again, the blows landing with a sickening thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die! Die! All of you, die!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="49.html">« Prev</a><a href="51.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
