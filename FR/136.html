His gaze was cold when it locked onto Wilson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wilson met that cold gaze, and an overwhelming chill spread through his body in an instant. Cold sweat beaded densely on his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suppressing the discomfort and pain coursing through him, he stammered, "Mr. Hawke..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was about to speak further, Julian abruptly shifted his gaze away, cutting him off completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian had already turned to Aurora. With his long strides, he reached her in just a few steps and naturally took her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On Aurora's skin, a large red mark from the scalding oatmeal stood out harshly, with blisters beginning to rise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's brows furrowed deeply. He guided Aurora to the sofa and had her sit down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Beatrice, Ashley, and Daisy stepped out of their rooms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice immediately noticed the burn on Aurora's arm. Her eyes turned red with distress. "What happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley's eyes welled up with tears. Ever since Aurora had affectionately called her, she had regarded her as her sweetheart, cherishing her dearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally, if Aurora so much as sneezed or coughed, Ashley would worry about her fragile health.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, seeing her burned like this, she was beside herself with worry and quickly ran to fetch the medical kit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy, meanwhile, spotted Lily and exclaimed in surprise, "Lily, what are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze then swept over the chaotic scene in the room, the mess on the floor, and the disheveled appearances of Wilson and Lizeth. She frowned and asked, "What happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily recounted the entire incident without missing a detail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy's eyes filled with disgust as she shot a sharp glare at Wilson and Lizeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice, furious, struck her cane heavily against the floor. A loud thud echoed through the silent living room. "You dare harm my grandson's wife in the Hawke Estate? You two are utterly audacious!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian gently placed Aurora's hand on his lap, took the medical kit from Ashley, and began treating her burn himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His movements were incredibly gentle. As he applied the medicine, he asked with concern, "Does it hurt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora kept her gaze fixed on him and shook her head lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian felt heartache. His touch became even softer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, the entire living room was so silent that even the smallest sound could be heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice, Ashley, Daisy, and Lily all had their eyes on Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Wilson and Lizeth, completely ignored, felt as though every passing second was a torment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until 10 minutes later that Julian finally finished treating Aurora's burn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian closed the medical kit and lifted his head. His gaze was cold when swept over Wilson and Lizeth. His voice was low. "You'd better give me an explanation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though his voice wasn't loud, it carried an undeniable authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wilson clenched his teeth, the muscles in his face twitching with barely restrained anger. "Mr. Hawke, we didn't come here to stir up trouble. We came for our son. Didn't expect to find the person responsible for our daughter into a coma patient right here! That's why we lost our tempers and hit her. But she deserved it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lizeth, disregarding her disheveled state, spoke anxiously, "Mr. Hawke, this woman is no saint! Five years ago, she was just eighteen, she was already ruthless, </span><span>wanna</span><span> kill my daughter. And now, five years later, who knows what despicable means she used to seduce you? You mustn't be fooled by her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! That's exactly right! We hit her not just for our daughter but also for your sake. If word gets out that the heir of the Hawke family is involved with a criminal, it won't do your reputation any good, wouldn't you agree?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wilson's last sentence carried an implicit threat as if warning that if Julian insisted on protecting Aurora, he would waste no time in spreading the news of his relationship with a former convict throughout high society.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he clearly didn't understand Julian at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian had never cared for public perception. He had even let rumors about his supposed inadequacy just to keep women at bay. A mere threat to his reputation was meaningless to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could threaten him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian smiled slightly, but it was laced with mockery and disdain. His gaze on Wilson and Lizeth grew even colder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been preoccupied with East Suburb project lately and almost forgot about Sherwood Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At these words, Wilson and Lizeth instantly stiffened. Their once arrogant expressions faded, draining the color from their faces bit by bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wilson instinctively clenched his fists. He had never expected Julian to say something like that. It was a blatant warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... what do you mean by that?" Wilson asked nervously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian didn't bother acknowledging them. He calmly pulled out his phone from his pocket and dialed Ethan's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice struck Wilson and Lizeth. "Launch a full-scale attack on Sherwood Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wilson and Lizeth's eyes widened in </span><span>shock,</span><span> horror written all over their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian was declaring war on Sherwood Group without hesitation or negotiation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sherwood Group was the top corporation in </span><span>Orley</span><span>, a powerhouse that had stood strong for years, with business spanning multiple industries and deep-rooted influence. It wasn't an entity that could be shaken easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the way Julian spoke made it sound as effortless as discussing the weather. His tone was indifferent, yet absolute, leaving Wilson and Lizeth with no choice but to believe he meant every word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wilson had spent decades navigating the business world and knew the elite circles of </span><span>Peloland</span><span> inside and out. The Hawke family, as one of the most powerful aristocratic families in Putnam, had vast influence and connections. If they truly decided to move against Sherwood Group, it wouldn't be difficult at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wilson's face turned ashen, despair flooding his eyes. "Mr. Hawke, we were only acting out of love for our daughter. How can you be so blind to the truth? Is it really worth launching a business war over a woman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's face darkened. He repeated, "Acting out of love for your daughter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He savored the words, his expression growing even more unreadable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you truly love your daughter, you should find the real culprit from five years ago instead of blindly blaming Aurora."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wilson and Lizeth froze. Their voices overlapped in confusion. "What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaning back against the sofa, Julian exuded a languid elegance, but his tone remained sharp and commanding. "Your daughter has already woken up. If you want to know the truth, why don't you ask her yourselves?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shocking revelation left them momentarily speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Camille is awake?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before they could fully process it, Julian continued, "However, it seems your precious son has been hiding her away. If you truly want answers, you might want to start by questioning him in prison."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wilson and Lizeth fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If what Julian said was true, then had they wrongfully accused Aurora all these years?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they couldn't bring themselves to believe they had wronged Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Aurora wasn't the real culprit and someone else was responsible, then what did that make their actions? They had ordered people to harm Aurora in prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had they taken revenge on the wrong person while the true culprit remained free for five years?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, that can't be true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lizeth shook her head frantically, her eyes red as she glared at Aurora with stubborn desperation. "It was you. It had to be you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's eyes narrowed. "Give you one day for the truth. Twenty-four hours from now, expect to see you admit your mistake."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I'm satisfied, Sherwood Group will remain intact. If I'm not, then Sherwood Group will have no reason to exist."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cold gaze swept over Wilson and Lizeth, his expression devoid of mercy as he said, "See them out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wilson and Lizeth walked out of the Hawke Estate in a daze, their steps unsteady as if they had aged 10 years in an instant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After treating their injuries at the hospital, they immediately drove straight to the detention center.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="135.html">« Prev</a><a href="137.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
