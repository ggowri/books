Joshua would never do this to me... He loves me! How could he possibly do something like this?" Celeste whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice trembled uncontrollably while her hands shook like she was going through withdrawal. The documents&mdash;scalding hot in her mind&mdash;slipped from her fingertips and scattered across the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste felt her inner defenses crumbling like a sandcastle at high tide, but she still refused to accept the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How could this possibly be real?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always been certain that her family was picture-perfect&mdash;her husband adored her, and her children represented everything she hoped for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, everything turned out to be a massive lie, an elaborate con that Joshua had orchestrated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reality hit her like a brick to the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The world didn't just randomly serve up coincidences. When they stacked up one after another, someone was definitely pulling strings behind the scenes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had disappeared literally the day she was born.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her father took a fatal fall just three days after Aurora's birth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost immediately afterward, Joshua swooped in and seized control of Jerome Group, rebranding it as </span><span>Elvador</span><span> Group. The power transfer happened practically overnight while she was drowning in grief over losing her loved ones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later on, Joshua even changed their son's name from Barnett Jerome to Barnett </span><span>Elvador</span><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then, as if that wasn't enough, Joshua brought Bertha into the </span><span>Elvador</span><span> family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste had been consumed by guilt over her daughter, she poured every ounce of her maternal love into Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though they had housekeepers on staff, Celeste insisted on doing everything herself&mdash;from bottle feedings and diaper changes to those first babbled words and wobbly steps. She never missed a single milestone in that child's development.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She invested every ounce of her energy into raising the kids while Joshua handled all the company decisions, and she happily the whole stay-at-home mom lifestyle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sometimes a tiny red flag would pop up in her mind, but she always pushed it away. After losing both her father and daughter, she was alone in the Jerome family. She clung to Joshua like the last lifeboat on the Titanic, convincing herself it was love and everything was fine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The truth, though, was more brutal than anything she could've imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During her C-section, Joshua had actually bribed the doctor to remove one of her kidneys while she was on the operating table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For all these years, she'd loved Bertha with her whole heart and had even thrown her biological daughter Aurora under the bus to protect her&mdash;a choice that left Aurora suffering in prison for five whole years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, she finally discovered that the daughter she'd treated like a precious jewel was actually Joshua's love child with his damn mistress!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each revelation hit her like a wrecking ball to the chest, making it almost impossible to breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her world crashed and burned in seconds, everything around her turning into a blurry mess while feelings of despair and helplessness flooded over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mind kept replaying all the horrible things Aurora had endured over the years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After returning to the </span><span>Elvador</span><span> Villa, Aurora had been treated like the ultimate outcast&mdash;the entire family saw her as public enemy, constantly creating problems for her and making her life a living hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Were Joshua and his mistress secretly celebrating while their daughter received all the love and my daughter was tortured beyond recognition?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"AHHH!" Celeste suddenly clutched her head and let out a piercing scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Joshua, you have the blackest heart I've ever known!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything she had ever done to Aurora transformed into razor-sharp daggers that sliced straight through her conscience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste felt so overwhelmingly guilty and ashamed that she could barely look Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what felt like forever, she finally mustered enough courage to slowly lift her head, her eyes reflecting a cocktail of desperation, guilt, and heartbreak as she looked at Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't believe this. You made up this story, you're bitter we loved Bertha more. Trying to get back with lies. That must be it." Celeste insisted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She frantically shook her head, her hair flying wildly as she stared at Aurora with desperate intensity. Her eyes bored into Aurora, desperate to find the answer, but all she got back was that emotionless stare without a single ripple of emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste had gotten one thing right&mdash;Aurora absolutely wanted revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was exactly why she'd deliberately hidden the truth that Bertha was actually Isabella and Frank's biological daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted Celeste to experience the soul-crushing agony of treating her husband's affair baby like a treasure while tossing her own blood aside like trash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had zero interest in watching Celeste get some sick satisfaction from learning that Joshua had been played like a fiddle by Isabella and Frank. As far as she was concerned, everyone who had hurt her deserved to drown in their own misery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, Celeste looked like she was about to pass out from the sheer pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her husband had conned her out of a kidney, murdered her father, abandoned their daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even sent her to prison, and forced her to donate a kidney to his illegitimate daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Joshua, how could you do this to me&mdash;" She let out a gut-wrenching scream that sliced through the quiet hospital room, carrying endless despair and regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart felt like some invisible hand had ripped it into a million bleeding pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora watched Celeste's complete breakdown with a rush of savage satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that fleeting moment disappeared instantly, replaced by a wave of deep sadness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt depressed about having such clueless mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Here was this supposed high-society heiress who couldn't even spot a fake, stuck in some teenage-level romance fantasy while Joshua&mdash;the ultimate social climber&mdash;played her like a fiddle and wiped out her entire family fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Aurora had just been born into some normal, average family, her life probably wouldn't have turned into this train wreck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora couldn't stand looking at Celeste for another second, she turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Celeste saw this, she completely lost it, struggling like a wild animal and using whatever strength she had left to grab Aurora's arm while sobbing hysterically, "Aurora, please don't go! You're all I have left! I know I messed up&mdash;I'm begging you to forgive me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's expression remained stone-cold, not softening even slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd heard the words "I messed up" way too many times&mdash;she was numb and couldn't be bothered to believe these cheap apologies anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze swept over Celeste like an arctic wind, her eyes practically freezing the air between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. </span><span>Elvador</span><span>, you didn't mess up&mdash;I did. I was stupid to believe you. But don't worry, I've seen through your fake faces now, and I won't make that mistake again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if I end up dying in the streets, I won't come crawling back. Any debt I owed you for giving birth to me? I paid that off when I cut off my finger. We're completely done now&mdash;no debts, no ties, nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she yanked her hand away from Celeste without an ounce of mercy and stormed toward the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, wait&mdash;don't go&mdash;please forgive me just one more time," Celeste begged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She completely ignored her injured leg and desperately struggled to grab Aurora, while a voice screamed from the depths of her soul that if she let </span><span>Aurora walk</span><span> away, she would lose her daughter for good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears poured down her face, falling in fat droplets onto the bedsheets and leaving dark, wet stains everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thrashed around wildly until she tumbled off the hospital bed with a sickening thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain didn't even register as she sprawled pathetically on the floor, staring at Aurora's back with desperate hope in her eyes, praying she'd turn around and show even a flicker of concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Aurora didn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't hear a thing, or maybe she just didn't want to, as she walked away with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if she had heard Celeste's pleas, her heart had hardened beyond softening again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Aurora disappeared through the doorway, Celeste's eyes dilated in terror, her face a mask of pure fear and hopelessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't leave!
