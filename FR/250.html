"No, I've never seen him before. So I thought he was a human trafficker.

Great-grandma, don't worry. I know that.

Anyone stupid enough to try snatching his daughter was asking to get destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dropped everything like it was on fire and booked it to the police station.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's when he spotted Barnett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've told you</span><span>,</span><span> I'm not </span><span>some</span><span> human trafficker</span><span>!</span><span> I'm </span><span>that girl</span><span>'s uncle," Barnett was still explaining to the police.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Julian appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked at each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So it's you. After spending ten years in prison, you still can't behave?" Julian mocked indifferently. "What? Are you planning to hurt my daughter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's silence, Barnett said, "Julian, you know that's not what I meant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian </span><span>rubbed his temple</span><span>. "All I know is that you almost dug out my wife's kidney for your adopted sister."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett felt a pang in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hated himself, just as Celeste had hated herself until she died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">God has given me a chance to start over, but why couldn't I have been reborn sooner?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Otherwise, in this life, I wouldn't have hurt Aurora again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In both lives, after coming to his senses, he met the same fate and endured excruciating agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett pleaded, "Julian, I just wanted to see Aurora and Aria</span><span> here, not doing anything bad</span><span>. After all, I'm their brother and uncle. I mean them no harm."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian remained unfazed.

But if there's a next time, I won't show mercy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian stood up and turned away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett covered his face in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In both lifetimes, Aurora had never forgiven him. She hadn't even accepted his apology and compensation. The guilt within him yawned like a bottomless chasm, threatening to consume him whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett left the police station dejectedly. Initially, he'd intended to head back to Orley, yet a lingering reluctance gnawed at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without further hesitation, he made his way straight to the Science and Technology Research Institute and resolved to wait for Aurora there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He begged, "Aurora, I know I was wrong. Can you forgive me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't have lofty demands. All he yearned for was to hear Aurora grant him forgiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she was willing to forgive him, he would readily agree without a second thought, even if it meant facing death on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This had become his obsession, not just his own, but also Celeste's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, we </span><span>wronge</span><span>d you. </span><span>Bu</span><span>t I've already paid the price in my past life. Isn't that enough?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>O</span><span>ur mother has</span><span>...</span><span> passed away</span><span>.</span><span> She died without your forgiveness. You have no idea how much pain she was in at the end. She left this world with nothing but regrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't we just move past what happened in our past lives? What's it gonna take for you to let this go?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, I'm begging here. Just forgive me, please?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At almost thirty, Aurora had grown harder, colder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were dead empty, like looking into ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not then. Not now. Not ever." She just cut him off sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she walked away without even a look back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett wouldn't quit though. He chased after her, tried to grab her, but she slipped right past him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, are you really that heartless?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora made no reply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Me, heartless?</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">You all are way worse than I ever was!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The agony of the past life is undeniable.

You really gonna wait till I'm dead to forgive me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's eyes were cold as ice. "If you're gonna off yourself, do it somewhere else. I can't stand to watch. Now drive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car roared away, leaving Barnett standing there alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears streamed down his face nonstop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The damage was irreparable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how hard Barnett tried to atone for his mistakes, they were indelible, impossible to wipe away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this lifetime, he was fated never to win Aurora's forgiveness and was doomed to spend the rest of his days consumed by regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Aurora, is this the way you choose to punish us?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How cruel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's P</span><span>O</span><span>V:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could offer my most sincere love to those I held dear and could lay down my life even for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, if they didn't cherish it, I could reclaim every bit of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they hurt me, why should they ask for my forgiveness?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Letting bygones be bygones?
