Tell me, what kind of mother tries to slap her daughter when she sees her? Did you think slapping me was some reward?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that's the case, let me clarify something. You can save Bertha that kind of 'reward'."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's voice was honey-sweet, but her words dripped with venom, each syllable grinding Celeste's dignity into the dirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guests around them started whispering and exchanging glances, eyeing Celeste with judgment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a high-society lady, Celeste valued her reputation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with Aurora showing zero respect, Celeste's face alternated red and white with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I only hit you because I was worried about you!" Celeste exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You ran away from home without a penny to your name!

Where did you get that kind of money?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God knows what unsavory things you've been doing. As your mother, I must set you straight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every word from Celeste was carefully chosen. Though some implications remained unspoken, everyone present could read between the lines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's eyes turned ice-cold as she stared at Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made her sick to her stomach that a mother would throw such disgusting accusations at her daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Worried about me?" Aurora let out a bitter laugh. "Drop the act, Mrs. Elvador."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I lived with the Elvador family, you all either beat me or cursed at me.

"If we'd known you'd turn out like this, we never should have brought you back from the orphanage!" he spat. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We should have left you there to rot!</span><span> </span><span>Running away for a month! I bet you bought that dress with dirty money from selling </span><span>your body</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, you're trying to seduce men at Madam Hawke's birthday party? Dream on!</span><span> </span><span>I'm your father, and I have every right to teach my shameless slut of a daughter a lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's words hit like a bombshell, sending shockwaves through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whispers spread through the gathering as people shot Aurora's looks of disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua felt a surge of satisfaction at the reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">You little bitch,</span><span> he thought to himself, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">I'm your dad, and there's nothing you can do about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was too soft on you before, letting you get away with everything. But now you've crossed a line with your shameless behavior. When a child turns out badly, it's the father's fault. Even if I have to beat you to death, I won't let you continue acting like this," Joshua thundered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua raised his massive hand, ready to strike Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste rushed forward to restrain Aurora, making it easier for Joshua to hit her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, </span><span>stop being so stubborn.</span><span> Haven't you embarrassed us enough?" Celeste sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before either of them could reach Aurora, Ethan and Daniel swiftly kicked them to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Joshua and Celeste tried to fight back, Ethan called security guards to pin them down, leaving them helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's face turned bright red with rage.

"You'll pay for treating me like this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through her tears, Celeste wailed, "Aurora, we're your parents! How can you let them treat us this way?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now they suddenly remembered they were her parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Where was their parental love during those three years at the Elvador family, when they treated her like thin air and gave her nothing but the silent treatment?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Where was it when they forced her to take the blame for Bertha, leaving her to endure five years of abuse in prison?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Where was it when she returned home after prison, only to face their constant abuse and threats, landing her in the hospital multiple times while they prevented Camille from identifying the real culprit?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, only when she stood at the top, with the power to look down on them, they suddenly remembered they were her parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora felt no pity watching Joshua and Celeste kneeling at her feet like dogs. She felt only satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ethan, did Mr. Hawke send them an invitation?" she asked coolly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No," Ethan replied with a stern face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to the head of security, Sam Cooper, with an icy stare. "Explain yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam broke into a cold sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I apologize for my negligence.

"Break their legs first. That'll stop them from wandering where they don't belong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sam's eyes widened in fear.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="91.html">« Prev</a><a href="93.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
