Sweat beaded along his forehead and slipped down, mixing with tears he didn</span><span>'</span><span>t even realize were falling.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those ten years in prison had given his stomach some peace&mdash;he</span><span>'</span><span>d gotten used to the regular meals and medication.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, the sharp pain was back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It stabbed through him like a knife, the same way it had when his stomach was once perforated and he</span><span>'</span><span>d coughed up blood.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was unbearable. It made him want to die just to make it stop.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a choked gasp, Barnett collapsed onto the folding bed, curling into himself, clutching the diary to his chest like it could hold him together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Aurora</span><span>...</span><span> I</span><span>'</span><span>m sorry.

Do you want me to be ridiculed by my colleagues? Don't bring this kind of trash to disgust me."]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Mom and Dad only gave it a passing glance. Their eyes were filled with complex emotions, containing too many unspoken feelings.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[But through their expressions, I understood that they despised my gift as cheap and pitiful.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Yes!

It hurt so much.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[I didn't understand.

Living alone was better than the feeling of being looked down on every day.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[With mixed emotions, I dragged myself to school, absent-minded the entire day, my mind constantly replaying the events at home.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[After school that evening, I rode my bike back to the orphanage.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Along the way, the light rain pattered on me, its icy coldness biting through my clothes.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[The familiar gate of the orphanage came into view, and I surprisingly felt a sense of comfort.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[But before I could even park my bike, I saw the Elvador family's car parked in front of the orphanage.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[My dad got out of the car, and upon seeing me soaking wet, he didn't ask if I was cold. Without saying a word, he slapped me across the face.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[The crisp sound of the slap drowned out the sound of the rain. It landed so hard on my face that I felt my face burned.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[He pointed his finger at me, shouting, "You ungrateful girl! We've been looking for you all these years. After finally finding you, you cause trouble the moment you come home, and now you're trying to threaten us by running away?"]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[His eyes were wide with rage, his face contorted in anger as if I had committed an unforgivable crime.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[I covered my stinging face, tears welling up in my eyes, and desperately tried to explain, "Dad, I'm not threatening you, I just don't want to be hit or scolded..."]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[But my mom interrupted me before I could finish.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Tears were streaming down her face, and she looked heartbroken. With a trembling voice, she scolded me, "You come back so late. Were you out there messing around with people of ill repute? Girls your age are most likely to go down the wrong path. If you end up pregnant, you'll disgrace the family!"]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Her eyes were filled with disappointment and anger, and those tears seemed like the greatest accusation against me.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Barnett also stepped forward, his voice filled with malice as he warned me, "If you bring shame to the Elvador family, I'll break your legs. I'd rather lock you up than have you embarrass us."]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[To them, I seemed like a person guilty of the greatest crimes, and all my explanations felt so meaningless.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[They forcefully took me back to the Elvador Villa.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[As soon as we entered the villa, Barnett coldly warned, "If you don't learn to behave, don't bother going to school."]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Studying is the only way I can change my fate. How could I give up?]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[I silently thought to myself, maybe I wasn't trying hard enough, which led to such deep misunderstandings from them. Starting today, I will work hard to change their perception.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Even though all this home has given me is pain, I still long to find even a little warmth, a sense of belonging here.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Aurora, keep going!]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett stared at the words as if seeing the helpless yet stubborn Aurora from back then, struggling in the face of her family's misunderstandings and accusations.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hands trembled violently, nearly dropping the diary.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could I be so foolish, so cruel... I'm an idiot. I have to find Aurora, no matter the cost, and ask for her forgiveness," he muttered, overwhelmed with regret and guilt, his tears blurring his vision once more, dripping onto the yellowing pages of the diary.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett no longer had the courage to keep reading. Even without looking, he could probably guess what Aurora had written.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, for those three years, no one in the family had ever shown Aurora an ounce of care, only three years of harm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The contents of the diary brought his memories flooding back. In his mind, images of his entire family either hitting or scolding Aurora resurfaced.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the course of three years, their intentional and unintentional harm toward Aurora amounted to hundreds of instances. Nearly every week, Aurora would be humiliated and punished.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These images tormented Barnett, making him feel as if he were being torn apart. His head throbbed with pain, dizziness overwhelming him, the pain in his mind almost unbearable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, I'm so sorry. I will spend the rest of my life making it up to you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He placed the diary in the drawer, stumbling out the door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I have to find Aurora. I have to beg for her forgiveness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's hair was disheveled, his face streaked with tears as he rushed toward the door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stopped anyone he saw and asked, "Have you seen my sister?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's your sister?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My sister is Aurora Elvador. Have you seen her?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person shook their head. "No, I don't know her. Haven't seen her."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett continued asking other people, his demeanor increasingly frantic.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone he asked shook their head.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood on the busy street, dazed and lost.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's been ten years. Aurora, why aren't you home? Where have you gone? I really know I was wrong.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have to find Aurora and apologize to her in person.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, where are you? Aurora, where are you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett kept muttering to himself. Suddenly, his eyes lit up. "Julian! Yes, ten years ago, Aurora was with Julian. She must be at the Hawke Estate."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as though he had grabbed onto a lifeline. He immediately began rushing toward the Hawke Estate.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His steps grew faster and faster as if every step could shorten the distance between him and Aurora.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart was filled with both anticipation and unease, longing to see Aurora but fearing whether she would forgive him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he arrived in front of the Hawke Estate.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tall iron gate looked especially cold under the sunlight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett ran up to it, desperately banging on the gate, shouting, "Open the door! Let me in! I need to see Aurora!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice trembled, and the guilt and regret that had been suppressed for years erupted at that moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, it's Barnett. I've been released from prison. I've come to see you. Are you inside? If you are, please come out. I'm sorry. I came specifically to apologize to you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kept pounding on the gate, hoping the people inside could hear him, hoping Aurora would come out to meet him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as seconds ticked by, the gate remained tightly shut, and there was no sound.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett grew more and more desperate. He feared Aurora wasn't there, or that she didn't want to come out to see him, that she wouldn't forgive him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pounded harder, his voice growing more frantic. "Aurora, I know I was wrong. I really was wrong. Please come out and see me. I beg you..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the door slowly creaked open.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy stood in the doorway, looking at Barnett outside the gate.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She showed no emotion, her voice cold as she spoke, "Ms. Elvador is not here. Please leave."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy had aged considerably since the last time Barnett had seen her. Her hair had turned completely gray, and her back had become hunched.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Aurora and Lily had passed away one after the other, Daisy had been heartbroken. She was hospitalized for six months before being released.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since then, she had stayed at the Hawke Estate, her health too poor for her to do much of anything. She had been living there, spending her days in retirement.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett couldn't believe it. "Daisy, don't lie to me. Aurora has always been closest to you, she treated you like her own mother. If you're here, she has to be here too.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora must still be angry with me, refusing to come out to see me, right? It's okay. I'll wait here until she's ready to see me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy looked at the broken man in front of her and found it somewhat laughable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The once proud and arrogant eldest son of the Elvador family, who made Aurora's life miserable, is now in this pitiful state.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Now he realizes he was wrong? </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Finally, he's regretting it?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Doesn't he think it's too late? </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Ms. Elvador has been dead for ten whole years.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If only the Elvador family had treated Ms. Elvador a little better, how could she have passed away so young?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though ten years had passed, when Daisy thought back to what happened back then, her eyes instantly reddened.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a deep breath, hiding all of her sorrow.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold glance at Barnett, she turned and walked away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett urgently gripped the iron bars, squeezing so tightly that his knuckles turned white. "Daisy, don't go. Please, let me see Aurora. I know I've done so many wrong things in the past. I'm a bastard. I'm sorry.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now I truly understand my mistakes. These ten years in prison, I've regretted every single day. I've thought about it constantly. If I could see Aurora again, I would do anything to atone for my sins.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daisy, please. Tell me where she is. I just want to apologize. I just want her to know that I've really changed."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, tears flowed uncontrollably from Barnett's eyes. His body trembled slightly, the weight of his regret completely crushing him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy's heart ached. She remembered all the suffering Aurora had endured in the Elvador Villa, and those images pierced her heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Some wounds, once inflicted, can never be healed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Regret is useless. Ms. Elvador would never care for your apology."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Daisy slammed the door shut with a loud sound.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett went wild, screaming, "You have no right to stop me from seeing my sister! You have no right to make decisions for Aurora!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Open the door! Open it now! Aurora and I are siblings! We are family, and no one can change that!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how much he yelled, no one paid him any attention.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thud, Barnett collapsed to the ground, lost and broken. "Daisy, I know my apology can't fix anything, but it's the only thing I can do.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I beg you, for Aurora's sake, give me a chance to see her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I promise, as long as she's willing to meet me, to let me speak, I'll never disturb her life again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, I'm truly here to apologize. Please, let me see you. Even if you can't forgive me, just give me a chance to see you. Please..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how much Barnett begged, no one opened the door for him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sat there outside as if he would never get up unless Aurora agreed to meet him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the sky opened up, and heavy raindrops began to pour, hitting Barnett's body with a sharp, relentless sound.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rain drenched him entirely, water trickling down his hair and face, his clothes clinging to him, making him look utterly pitiful.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, no one paid him any attention until a car pulled up in front of the villa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A person holding an umbrella stood before him. Barnett slowly lifted his gaze, and when Aurora's stunning face came into view, a faint smile finally appeared on his face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, you finally came out to see me."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="203.html">« Prev</a><a href="205.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
