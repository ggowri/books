All of you! This room isn't for people like you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The laughter died down. Everyone turned to stare at Daisy, their eyes dripping with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your room? Please. The Grand Hotel's VIP suite isn't even available for regular bookings. You two nobodies think you can just waltz in here and eat?" one of them scoffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got some nerve! Aurora was dirt-poor in high school. She couldn't even afford food. </span><span>While we're all chowing down in the cafeteria, she's sitting there like some sad puppy, drinking water to kill the hunger pangs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And we'd try to share our food, you know, feeling bad for her, but she would act like she was too good for our scraps. Never met someone with their head so far up their own ass!" another one jumped in, hawking a </span><span>loogie</span><span> on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've known what she's like forever. And now she's here pretending to be some hotshot? It's hilarious!" someone else sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, if you came to the reunion just to cozy up to James, just admit it. We all know you're struggling. Why put on this ridiculous act?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Being smart doesn't mean a thing if you have no morals. You've even been to prison! How </span><span>dare you </span><span>show your face here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They kept going, their voices buzzing around Aurora like a swarm of annoying flies, hurling insults left and right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they talked, they strutted over and plopped down around the table like they owned the place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One guy slid into the seat next to Aurora, throwing an arm around her shoulder with a sleazy grin on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me what you want, and I'll treat you. </span><span>Y</span><span>ou're probably too broke to even buy a meal. Fresh out of school and straight to prison? Bet you've never tasted anything decent in your life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora jerked her arm free, shaking off his grubby hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Show some respect!" she snapped, her voice icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guy, a pudgy jerk in a suit named Gavin Murray, turned red with embarrassment after being shut down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lurched to his feet, jabbing a fat finger at her nose, and let loose a torrent of curses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, don't you dare act all high and mighty with me! I'm warning you. Miss this chance today, and you'll never step foot in the Grand Hotel again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others jumped in, egging him on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! Gavin's doing you a favor by offering to pay. How can you be so ungrateful?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gavin might have been the worst student back in high school, but he's a construction boss now, raking in at least a million dollars a year. He's doing better than any of us here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin soaked up the praise, puffing up like a peacock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rolled up his sleeves with a smug flourish, waving his hand in Aurora's face. His fingers glittered with gaudy rings, catching the light as if he were scared nobody would notice his wealth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he yanked out a designer phone and a set of BMW keys, slamming them on the table with a loud smack, desperate to flaunt his cash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole over-the-top display left Daisy gaping, mortified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora, on the other hand, looked at him with nothing but contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want to waste her breath on these clowns. She knew explaining herself wouldn't matter. They'd never believe her and would just accuse her of putting on airs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> she pulled out her phone, ready to call Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the second she took it out, another round of laughter erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"See? Told you she's a broke loser. She can't even afford a decent phone and still claims this room's hers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who uses a relic like that anymore? We've all got the fancy brands!" They whipped out their own phones like it was a competition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora ignored their taunts. She unlocked her screen and scrolled to her contacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first number pinned at the top was Julian's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she was about to hit call, Gavin snatched the phone from her hand and hurled it to the floor with a vicious swing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a piece of junk. Stop embarrassing yourself. I've got a few old phones lying around. After the reunion, I'll give you one. They are way better than that trash."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The phone hit the ground and shattered, bits and pieces scattered everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at that! I barely touched it, and it's in pieces. Did you fish that thing out of a dumpster or what?" Gavin jeered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His jab sparked another wave of cackling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were treating Aurora like a punching bag, laughing at her expense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her phone smash sent Aurora over the edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That phone was a gift from Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't know the brand, but it meant a lot to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, as she stared at the wreckage, fury surged through her like wildfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without thinking, she reared back and slapped Gavin hard across the face. The sharp crack echoed through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're nothing but a disgusting pig! Who the hell wants your filthy old phone?" she roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't stop there. Her hand flew again and again, smacking his oily, flushed face until it glowed red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin hadn't seen it coming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone else froze, stunned into silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their minds, Aurora </span><span>was</span><span> always the quiet type.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in high school, she poured everything into her studies, skipping hangouts even during breaks.</span><span> Could be called </span><span>a </span><span>total </span><span>loner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she'd been average and dumb, no one would've noticed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with her looks and smarts, she was hard to miss, and her ice queen attitude always rubbed people the wrong way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time they snapped out of their shock, Aurora had landed six solid slaps on Gavin's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally shook off the daze, his temper exploding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You little bitch! How dare you hit me? You're dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised a meaty fist, ready to strike her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the door swung open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Who's</span><span> Ms. Walker?" a soft, feminine voice called out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every head swiveled toward the entrance. A waitress stood there, smiling warmly, pushing a fancy cart with a gorgeous birthday cake on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Who's</span><span> Ms. Walker?" she asked again, her tone gentle when no one answered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A woman in a red dress stepped forward. "That's me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her name was Stella Walker, and Walker was indeed her last name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tilted her head, puzzled. "What's this about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The waitress sized her up. Seeing her decked out in a festive dress, with flawless makeup and a stylish look, the waitress assumed she was the birthday girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her manager had emphasized earlier that the president of Hawke Group had booked Room 101 for some Ms. Walker's party.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone important enough to catch the eye of Hawke Group's president was a big deal, and the hotel couldn't afford to mess this up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> the waitress cranked up the fake smile, rolling the cake to Stella. "Ms. Walker! Special birthday cake from us here at Grand Hotel. Happy birthday!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella's face went blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was totally thrown off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't her birthday today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She still had half a month to go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Did James set this whole thing up with the hotel?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Yeah, had to be him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">We haven't all hung out since high school, and who knows when we'll get the gang back together after this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella figured James was just trying to do something nice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his fancy new sales manager gig at Hawke Group, he definitely had the juice to make things happen. Booking the VIP suite was proof of that, right? Getting her a birthday cake early would've been nothing as well.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="175.html">« Prev</a><a href="177.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
