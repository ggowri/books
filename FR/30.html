You need to take care of yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren had expected Aurora to remain silent as she usually did, but this time, she spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was soft yet cold. "Joshua insisted on hitting me. What's the use of taking care of myself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren was taken aback by her response. He thought for a moment and said, "He hit you, but you could have dodged. If you just stood there, of course, you'd get hurt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stared at him blankly, making Darren feel uncomfortable under her gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you looking at me like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren's words, though seemingly caring, were anything but genuine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When someone was truly concerned about you, they didn't just tell you to rest&mdash;they would take you to the doctor, get you medicine, and take care of you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had no intention of engaging with Darren, but he frowned, acting as if he was showing concern and she was ungrateful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora said weakly, "How do you know I didn't move? I can't even walk fast without difficulty. Tell me how I was supposed to dodge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren felt like he was being interrogated. While Aurora hadn't intended to question him, she was simply stating the obvious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Darren was a man used to having the last word and disliked being contradicted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He became irritable and started speaking without thinking, "Mr. Joshua Elvador is a reasonable man. If you hadn't provoked him, he wouldn't have hit you. You need to look inward. Don't blame everyone else for your problems."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He actually expected her, the victim, to find fault in herself</span><span>?</span><span> Aurora felt a sharp pain in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the weaker party, she didn't even have the right to fight back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't some privileged lady. She was just a woman who had been oppressed and tamed to the lowest rung.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was the one being bullied, yet she was still the one being lectured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora suddenly felt exhausted. She didn't want to engage in meaningless arguments anymore. Indifferently, she said, "Get out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren's face was filled with astonishment. "What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said, get out." Despite her weak voice, Aurora's tone was firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren had never been dismissed like this before. He turned angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're really ungrateful," he muttered, turning to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking a few steps, he still felt unsatisfied and added, "You deserve </span><span>all </span><span>the suffering you're going through."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those words felt like a sharp knife stabbing directly into Aurora's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face turned pale, and she felt her blood freezing in her veins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit her lip so hard that it bled, the taste of rust filling her mouth, but she didn't even notice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that no one in this world could really understand her pain. No one would stand up for her or seek justice on her behalf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even her suffering seemed to be seen as something she brought upon herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren ran into Barnett outside the hospital room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said irritably, "I suggest you don't go in. She's in a bad mood. You'll just get yelled at."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's gaze was fixed on Aurora's frail, bruised body through the glass of the hospital room. "How is she?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren snorted coldly. "She's doing just fine. She still had the energy to argue with me. By the way, why did your dad hit her? Seriously, he did go a bit overboard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett didn't respond. He just stood there, watching Aurora, too pained to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren continued to grumble, "Was it because she bullied Bertha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop talking nonsense," Barnett interrupted sharply, his brows furrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't that the case?" Darren pressed on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it's not."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright," Darren conceded, seeing that Barnett wasn't willing to elaborate. "I'll get back to work. You should go rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett stood outside the hospital room, his eyes never leaving Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long while, he finally turned around and left, dragging his heavy steps behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, sunlight streamed through the windows into the spacious and bright kitchen of the Elvador Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy stood in front of the counter, carefully packing the food she had prepared for Aurora into a thermos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had woken up early just to make this for Aurora, hoping that Aurora's mood might improve if she ate well in the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Daisy was about to grab the salmon chowder, a slender, fair hand reached out and picked up the chowder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy looked up to see Bertha about to eat it. Without thinking, she quickly stopped her. "Ms. Bertha Elvador, this is for Ms. Aurora Elvador."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha narrowed her eyes, her tone arrogant and disdainful. "Daisy, remember your place. You're just a servant in this house, not the owner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew she had no right to lecture Bertha, but Bertha seemed to have never understood her own position either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy said helplessly, "Ms. Bertha Elvador, Ms. Aurora Elvador is injured. This chowder </span><span>is good for her</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha's face immediately turned sour and bitter. She sneered, "What do you mean? Are you saying I don't deserve to have my strength replenished?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Bertha Elvador, that's not what I meant," Daisy tried to explain. "I'm saying Ms. Aurora Elvador is very weak right now. Since there's only one bowl of salmon chowder left, I thought it would be good for her nutrition."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're still saying I don't deserve it!" Bertha raised her voice, not letting it go. "What's wrong with me having some salmon chowder in my own house? You, a servant, have no right to tell me what to do. You look down on me because I'm not your parents' biological daughter, don't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy shook her head frantically, trying to defend herself, "Ms. Bertha Elvador, I never meant that..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha began to cry as if wronged, tears streaming down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Joshua and Celeste were just coming downstairs for breakfast. Hearing the commotion from the kitchen, they frowned in annoyance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on? Stop all this noise!" Joshua's voice was authoritative and stern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste quickly walked over. Seeing Bertha crying, she asked with concern, "Bertha, what's wrong? Why are you crying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha found her support and threw herself into Celeste's arms. "Mom, Daisy looked down on me. She said I'm not your biological daughter and don't deserve to have salmon chowder!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's face darkened, and her gaze turned as sharp as a knife as she looked at Daisy. "Did you really talk to my daughter like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy shook her head frantically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never expected Bertha to twist her words so blatantly. At that moment, she truly understood the anger and helplessness Aurora must have felt when being framed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Elvador, I never said Ms. Bertha Elvador doesn't deserve salmon chowder. I just said I wanted to take it to the hospital for Ms. Aurora Elvador to help her recover."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste was still not satisfied with this explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daisy, are you saying Bertha is lying to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua interrupted her. "Daisy, it seems you're getting senile and can't tell who's more important anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bertha is the real daughter of the Elvador family. As for Aurora, she has no manners whatsoever. She almost killed me last night. She doesn't deserve salmon chowder. She's just a criminal who belongs in prison for the rest of her life."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="29.html">« Prev</a><a href="31.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
