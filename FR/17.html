"What's wrong? Did I hurt you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora couldn't hear what Daisy was saying clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's slap had made her already-poor-hearing right ear even worse. She could only vaguely hear faint sounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she knew lip-reading and understood what Daisy was saying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before going to prison, Aurora hadn't known lip-reading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason she learned it now was that after losing her hearing in the left ear, she often couldn't hear the instructions given to her by those people. As a result, they tortured her even more brutally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To get beaten less, Aurora forced herself to learn lip-reading. Even if she couldn't hear clearly, she could understand their meaning through lip-reading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora swallowed the bitterness and forced a smile, saying, "Daisy, I'm fine. I'm just hungry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about the unpleasant things that happened in the morning, Daisy felt indignant on Aurora's behalf in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Aurora is so kind and sensible. How come they can't see that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What would you like to eat?" asked Daisy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora replied, "Spaghetti with bolognese sauce."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I'll go make it right away," said Daisy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora nodded and sat up, then leaned against the headboard, looking out of the window with dull eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After an unknown amount of time, the door was pushed open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora thought it was Daisy. But to her surprise, it was Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste met Aurora's indifferent gaze, and her heart ached. But she didn't back down. Instead, she sat down by the bedside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Aurora, I made spaghetti with bolognese sauce for you. Come and have a taste."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste even tried to feed Aurora personally, but Aurora dodged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can do it myself." Aurora reached out to take the plate and fork.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lowered her eyes to look at the plate of spaghetti with bolognese sauce. Without excessive seasoning, it still smelled delicious and could fully stimulate her appetite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora picked up some and put them in her mouth, chewing slowly. Immediately, the familiar taste filled her mouth, and her whole body warmed up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do you like the spaghetti I made?" Celeste looked at her expectantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora paused in the action of eating spaghetti. "You made it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. Even Bertha has never eaten spaghetti made by me. You're the first one." She seemed to be showing her love for Aurora, her biological daughter, by saying this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, instead of being touched, Aurora sneered and said nothing, continuing to eat the spaghetti.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste did not know the special meaning of spaghetti with bolognese sauce to Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A simple plate of spaghetti with bolognese sauce had warmed her entire winter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all these years, Aurora could still clearly remember that the first time Daisy made spaghetti with bolognese sauce for her was in the winter when she was in her first year of high school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On a pitch-black night, she rode her bike back home against the wind and snow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole villa was dark, and no one had left a light on for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Elvador family had eaten and drunk their fill and gone to bed early, while Aurora was shivering from the cold and could only eat the already-cold food to fill her stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, that night, her stomach started to churn uncomfortably. She didn't feel better until she vomited up everything she had eaten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Daisy who had found Aurora sick when she got up in the middle of the night, took care of Aurora, and cooked Aurora a plate of steaming spaghetti with bolognese sauce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From that day on, Daisy would leave a light on for Aurora every night and wait for her to come back from school to make her food like spaghetti with bolognese sauce, ravioli, or oatmeal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the Elvador family knew that Barnett had a weak stomach, but no one knew that Aurora had also developed a stomach problem since becoming a part of the Elvador family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora thought, "I had never had stomach problems in the orphanage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After returning to my so-called home, I had irregular meals, which ruined my stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How ironic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora could never forget the taste of the spaghetti with bolognese sauce made by Daisy. Of course, she could tell who made the spaghetti in her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She ate up all the spaghetti.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smile appeared on Celeste's face. "Is it delicious?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staring at her lips, Aurora got straight to the point. "Say what you want to say directly. You don't need to beat around the bush with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her emotionless words instantly distanced the relationship between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste frowned, looking displeased, "Aurora, I have good intentions towards you. Why can't you let go of your grudges?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora didn't say a word, just stared at her. Her gaze seemed to be able to see through her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under such a gaze, Celeste gradually gave in. "Aurora, what exactly do I have to do for you to accept me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora still didn't speak because she knew that even if she said something, Celeste couldn't do it. So there was no point in talking to Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste talked softly for a long time, but all she got in return was Aurora's indifference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, she sighed helplessly and said earnestly, "Aurora, although you're angry, you can't ignore the Elvador Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the Elvador Group and the Sherwood Group don't resume cooperation, the losses of the Elvador Group will keep increasing. You're a member of the Elvador family, and you should do your part for the family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, Aurora had always thought Celeste was a decent person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But seeing Celeste like this today, Aurora realized she had been wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste was just like the others in the Elvador family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Celeste wanted to pretend to care about Aurora, Celeste should at least pretend better. But Celeste didn't even bother to pretend, using the spaghetti with bolognese sauce made by Daisy to deceive Aurora while talking about high-sounding principles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Aurora felt extremely sad that she shared the same blood as the Elvador family. "Get out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" asked Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Either you get out, or I will." Aurora lifted the quilt, pretending to get out of bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In just five years, how have you become so unreasonable?" Celeste was so angry that her chest heaved violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora sneered, "You've been living a carefree life outside. Five years is, of course, short for you. But in prison, I was either beaten or scolded. These five years should have been Bertha's punishment. It was you who deleted the surveillance and got me imprisoned, leaving a stain on my life. Is this what you call 'good intentions'? Then please, don't be 'good' to me. I can't bear it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... You are unreasonable," retorted Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora said calmly, "Yes, I'm unreasonable. It would be better if you never talk to me again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste turned around angrily, too ashamed to face Aurora any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stayed in Barnett's room for a whole day. At night, Joshua came in and started yelling at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason was that the Elvador Group had lost another one billion dollars within that day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The losses of the Elvador Group would not stop as long as it didn't cooperate with the Sherwood Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora kept smiling at Joshua. Her expression almost made Joshua faint from anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before leaving, Barnett gave her a deep look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, Aurora didn't understand the meaning of this look until the next day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she woke up, Aurora found that her right ear had regained a little hearing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she went downstairs, she heard two maids talking about Daisy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them said, "Why isn't Daisy here today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other replied, "I heard something happened to her daughter. The school seems to be planning to expel her daughter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora suddenly looked at Barnett, who was sitting on the living room sofa reading a newspaper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if sensing something, Barnett turned to look at her, giving her a meaningful smile.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="16.html">« Prev</a><a href="18.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
