"Hello?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's voice came through the phone. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawke, there's a crucial matter in the East Suburb project that requires your personal attention. I'll pick you up in a bit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright," Julian responded, taking a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan noticed that his voice sounded different from usual as if he was weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawke, are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine," Julian replied curtly before hanging up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He forced himself to sit up, but his vision blurred due to low blood sugar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian gritted his teeth and swore to himself, "I will definitely eat properly from now on, no exceptions!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After washing up, Julian, dressed in a black suit, opened his bedroom door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he opened the door, the familiar scent of cilantro hit him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian had a bad feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stood there with her usual gentle smile, "Mr. Hawke, good morning. Perfect timing. I made pasta. Would you have some?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's gaze fell on the pasta on the dining table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps because he had eaten too quickly yesterday, Aurora mistakenly thought he hadn't had enough. Today, the portion was even larger than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's smile deepened. "You woke up early today, so you don't have to rush like yesterday. Take your time. If it's not enough, there's more in the kitchen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's mouth twitched involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt the need to explain to Aurora that he was allergic to cilantro, but seeing the expectant look in her eyes, he couldn't bring himself to say it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It's just an allergy. I'll take some medicine later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he thought this, his steps toward the dining table were still hesitant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he sat down, the doorbell rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's eyes lit up.</span><br><span>Ethan's here already?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Then I can pretend I'm in a hurry and take this plate of pasta with me. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I'll give it to Ethan in the car. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That way, Aurora's kindness won't go to waste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So he said, "I'll get the door."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora couldn't hear the doorbell, but she understood Julian's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly said, "Mr. Hawke, I'll get it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she hurried over and opened the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian sat at the dining table, not touching his food. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared intently at the door, eagerly anticipating Ethan's arrival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when he saw who it was, his expectations were instantly shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't Ethan at the door&mdash;it was Lily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Aurora opened the door, Lily, like a cheerful little bird, spread her arms and gave her a big hug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, I missed you so much," Lily said, taking a deep breath near Aurora's neck. "You smell so good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian felt as if something of his had been taken over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora asked in surprise, "It's not the weekend today. Why are you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily let go of her, her face beaming with a smile. "I don't have classes this morning, so I came to see you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can I come to see you whenever I don't have classes?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's cheerful and playful demeanor made her seem like a carefree little girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the look in Lily's eyes as she gazed at Aurora was filled with tenderness and concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily just wanted to make Aurora happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's expression softened, and she patted Lily's head as if soothing a child. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I'd love to see you every day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could she not like someone as </span><span>cute</span><span> as Lily?</span><br><span>Just looking at Lily brightened her mood considerably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora took Lily's hand and led her inside. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, have a seat. There's more pasta in the pot. I'll get you some."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily giggled, "Aurora, you're so </span><span>nice</span><span>. If I were a man, I'd definitely marry you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora gave her a helpless look. "You and your sweet talk."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily stuck out her tongue playfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intimate bond between Lily and Aurora made Julian feel uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Lily passed by him, she merely nodded in his direction as a form of greeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she happily followed Aurora into the kitchen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the kitchen, Aurora's voice could be heard. "Why are you following me in here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily replied in a coquettish tone, "I finally get to see you. I just want to spend more time with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was amused by Lily's words&nbsp;and laughed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two chatted and laughed in the kitchen, making Julian feel somewhat out of place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Ethan walked in from outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawke, are you ready?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily, who was about to serve herself some pasta, froze at the sound of his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why does this voice sound so familiar?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned her head to look toward the dining area and saw a man in a silver-gray suit, wearing gold-rimmed glasses, walking over. He looked refined and handsome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she saw him, Lily's eyes widened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Isn't that the man who gave me a million dollars?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Isn't he friends with those scumbags Darren and Barnett? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why is he here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And it looks like he's Mr. Hawke's subordinate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's mind was in complete chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Ethan seemed to sense something and glanced toward the kitchen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily was so startled that she quickly turned her head away, stiffening in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's gaze lingered on Lily's silhouette. "That person..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why does her back&nbsp;look so familiar?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Ethan pondered, Aurora walked out with a plate of pasta and introduced. "This is Lily, Daisy's daughter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Daisy's daughter?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">She looks about the same age as Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Lily?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but think of the Lily he knew, feeling that their silhouettes were even more alike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan stared intently at Lily as if waiting for her to turn around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily was so nervous that she broke out in a cold sweat, feeling utterly panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Aurora asked, "Ethan, have you eaten? Would you like some too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan withdrew his gaze and smiled at Aurora. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was about to take the pasta from her hands, Julian's deep voice interrupted, "He's already had breakfast."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Julian picked up the plate of pasta in front of him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have some urgent matters to attend to. I'll take this with me and eat on the way. Ethan, let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian turned and strode out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan reluctantly glanced at the pasta in Aurora's hands and then took one last deep look at Lily's back in the kitchen before quickly following Julian out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once outside, Julian shoved the plate of pasta into Ethan's hands. "Here, eat it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan was both surprised and flattered. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when he looked down and saw the cilantro on the plate, he immediately understood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled teasingly, "Cilantro is so delicious, yet you can't eat it. What a shame."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian opened the car door and got into the driver's seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>S</span><span>eems your salary is still too high."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan paused mid-bite. "Why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Y</span><span>ou talk too much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan then had to keep his mouth shut.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="157.html">« Prev</a><a href="159.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
