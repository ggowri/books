It must be a long day. Come sit on the couch and I'll massage your shoulders!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those beautiful memories now played relentlessly in Barnett's mind, forming a stark contrast with the Aurora before him, whose eyes were ever cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he struggled fiercely, Ethan had him pinned to the ground. Immobilized, he could only look up at Aurora and Julian from this humiliating position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, I'm your brother. Are you really going to watch outsiders treat me like this?" Barnett said, his voice thick with resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stood silently, saying nothing. Her slender figure radiated an unexpected resilience. Her eyes remained calm</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>She seemed</span><span> </span><span>deaf to Barnett's pleas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such silence proved more devastating than any words could be, shattering his heart into countless pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett finally understood&mdash;the Aurora who had once been easily manipulated and desperate for family affection was truly gone forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The anger and resentment in his heart surged, raging through his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face flushed crimson, features contorting as he spat venomously, "Let's set aside what happened to Mom and Dad for now. What about Bertha? You knew appearance meant everything to her, yet you had someone shave her head. How can you still be as vicious as ever?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He deliberately emphasized "as ever," as if searching for reasons to keep blaming Aurora, despite knowing deep down that she had never been malicious before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora listened expressionlessly as if Barnett</span><span> was talking nonsense</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that's what you think, so be it." Her voice was soft but carried an unmistakable coldness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett faltered, feeling powerless. He never expected </span><span>that </span><span>Aurora wouldn't even bother defending herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth, madness flashing in his eyes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't get carried away. I'll rescue Bertha soon. She's accustomed to fine things&mdash;that embroidery was just a worthless piece. Bertha wouldn't take it even if I offered it to her for free. You must have deliberately ruined it yourself and framed her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had heard too many such accusations. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were in the past</span><span>, she might have been devastated by Barnett's allegations. Now, her heart had completely hardened toward them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gently tugged Julian's sleeve and said calmly, "Mr. Hawke, let's go. I have nothing more to say to him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian looked down at Aurora, the coldness in his eyes instantly replaced by tenderness. "You get in the car first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora nodded slightly and, under Julian's gentle gaze, seated herself elegantly in the vehicle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel stepped forward, carefully adjusted the hem of her dress, then positioned himself to block Barnett's view of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett glared, shouting hysterically, "Aurora, get out! Bertha shouldn't suffer in prison. You must come with me to the police and explain that you staged all this yourself. You spread rumors and caused trouble&mdash;you're the one who belongs in prison!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's harsh voice cut through the night, as if this desperate attempt might still salvage something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian frowned, disgust flashing in his eyes. He'd never encountered someone so pathetic in Putnam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking down at Barnett, he extended his fingers to grip Barnett's jaw, forcing the man to meet his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's stare was penetrating, sending a chill down his spine. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite coming from the prestigious Elvador family and living a life of luxury, Barnett couldn't help but tremble under that gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You care so much about Bertha. Do you have feelings for her?" Julian asked, his voice low, dripping with sarcasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett was stunned, speechless. His mouth hung slightly open, and his face was filled with disbelief, as if he'd heard the most </span><span>ridiculous</span><span> </span><span>joke imaginable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could respond, Julian remarked icily, "How disgusting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he released Barnett's chin with a grimace of revulsion, as if he'd touched something utterly foul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel immediately offered a white handkerchief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian accepted it, wiping his hands deliberately before casually tossing it onto Barnett's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The white cloth slipped from his face to the ground, gathering dust&mdash;much like Barnett's shattered dignity in that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian turned and prepared to enter the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperate now, like a drowning man clutching at straws, Barnett shouted, "Mr. Hawke, please let Bertha go. I can give you 20 million dollars as compensation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian paused, turning his head slightly to cast a cold glance at Barnett. "Money is the last thing I need."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then what do you want?" Barnett couldn't conceive of any other way to persuade Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian didn't answer immediately. He stood quietly for a moment before his lips curved into a barely perceptible smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, what he wanted was to make Aurora happy&mdash;to ensure those who had hurt her received the punishment they deserved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he saw no need to share these thoughts with Barnett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without sparing him another glance, Julian entered the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Daniel got in, Ethan shoved Barnett aside and entered</span><span> the car</span><span> as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car pulled away slowly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching it disappear, Barnett collapsed to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally realized that he had destroyed the last remnants of family bonds between himself and Aurora. And it was entirely his fault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett struggled to his feet, his steps unsteady, walked dazedly toward his car, and headed towards the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he arrived at the ward, the anesthetic had worn off for Joshua and Celeste. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Excruciating pain had them writhing and wailing in their beds, and their cries echoed throughout the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Use the pain pump! Quickly, use the pain pump!" Joshua shouted hoarsely, sweat beading on his forehead as his face turned ashen with agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nurse was about to administer the pain medication when Barnett burst in shouting, "Don't use it!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was ragged and filled with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua was instantly furious. Despite the pain in his legs, he pointed at Barnett and snarled, "Have you lost your mind? Are you trying to kill your mother and me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett suddenly erupted in laughter&mdash;hollow, filled with boundless sorrow. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His manic appearance frightened Joshua and Celeste so much that they fell silent, momentarily forgetting the pain in their legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nurse was equally terrified by Barnett's demeanor and nearly dropped the pain </span><span>pump.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett rushed forward and swept all the medicines off the cabinet onto the floor. Glass bottles shattered with a crisp sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His bloodshot eyes bulged as he stared at his parents in their hospital beds and roared, "Aurora's legs were broken in prison, and she couldn't even get treatment. She had to endure it. You hurt her that badly&mdash;what makes you think you deserve treatment?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="107.html">« Prev</a><a href="109.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
