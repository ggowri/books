Should thank me for wanting your skanky ass! Every dude in town had a piece, so drop the virgin act! Fighting back? I'll fuck you up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man went psycho, beating her down like a rabid dog.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her screams echoed through that nasty pig pen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Between sobs, she cried out, "I'm the lady of the </span><span>Elvador</span><span> family! My dad's a chairman! My mom's </span><span>from </span><span>old money! My brother's a CEO! They're coming for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spat back, "Chairman? Haha, your old man's a fucking vegetable who can't </span><span>even </span><span>wipe his own ass</span><span> now</span><span>! Wake up</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't even pop out a kid, you</span><span> </span><span>cum dumpster. Think you're getting out? Dream on, bitch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man kept stomping on her until he was wheezing like a chain smoker, too wiped to throw another kick. Finally quit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stumbled out, breathing heavy and trying to straighten his nasty clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he spotted Aurora, Julian, and Daniel right there in the yard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes locked on Aurora like a starving dog eyeing meat. Pure lust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's one fine piece you got there. Good breeding stock. Bet she'd pop out boys left and right." He smirked. "You selling her? Name your price and I'll take her now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He flashed those yellow teeth&mdash;looked like they'd never seen a toothbrush in their life. Just looking at that mess made you </span><span>wanna</span><span> gag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's eyes narrowed dangerously. He pulled Aurora against his chest, wrapping her in his protective embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Daniel didn't waste time with words. He launched into action with a flying kick that sent </span><span>this </span><span>middle-aged creep flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man soared a good ten feet before crashing hard onto the ground, nearly knocking himself unconscious from the impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That single kick was all it took for him to realize these three weren't people to mess with. </span><span>He scrambled up like a drunk raccoon and ran like hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A figure dragged itself out of the pig pen, chains scraping across concrete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was nothing but skin and bones. Cheekbones sharp enough to cut glass, eyes sunken so deep they looked dead, face like something out of a horror movie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hair was a matted mess, caked with dirt and grime. She wore a tattered shirt on her upper body but nothing to cover her lower half.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her skin was unbearable to look at&mdash;crisscrossed with countless scars that seemed to come from both knives and whips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both her legs were twisted all wrong, definitely broken on purpose. No way in hell she could stand&mdash;had to</span><span> crawl along the ground</span><span> like an animal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd locked her down with these massive chains around her ankles, metal grinding against metal every time she moved her broken body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora recognized her instantly&mdash;</span><span>it</span><span> was Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My parents and brother will rescue me," Bertha mumbled as she painfully dragged herself forward. "They love me most. They even framed their own daughter for me. I'm their precious jewel. They'll come for me eventually... I need to take care of myself. Eat. Must eat..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She finally reached the pig trough in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trough contained chicken feed that gave off a nauseating, rank smell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Bertha grabbed handfuls of the feed and shoved it into her mouth, not caring how filthy it was as she gobbled it down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karma had done a real number on her. The formerly spoiled rich girl who treated everyone like garbage was now scraping the bottom of the barrel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora watched her with a mixture of shock and bitter satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bet you never thought you'd end up like this, huh, Bertha?" Aurora's tone was ice-cold, her eyes mocking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sound of Aurora's voice, Bertha froze. She slowly turned around, her lifeless eyes meeting Aurora's scornful gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, confusion clouded her face, like she couldn't quite place Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her hatred for Aurora had taken such deep root that her body reacted instinctively. Just seeing Aurora's face triggered an overwhelming disgust that instantly ignited her rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha didn't even bother to wipe the chicken feed from her mouth as she let out a deep, vicious growl like a wild animal. She lunged at Aurora with everything she had, looking like she genuinely wanted to tear Aurora's throat out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she barely made it a foot before the iron chain yanked her back hard. She toppled forward and slammed face-first into chicken shit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That didn't stop her crazy rampage though. She clawed and scrambled on the ground, thrashing around like a complete lunatic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll kill you! I swear I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked down at her with pure disgust. "Kill me? As if you could."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was ice-cold but had a hint of satisfaction. "Hey Bertha, </span><span>wanna</span><span> know something? I came all the way out to these mountains </span><span>just to see how pathetic your life turned out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back at the </span><span>Elvador</span><span> Villa, </span><span>you were nothing but drama. That was my home, but I was treated like some stray dog. My parents and brother couldn't stand me&mdash;they favored you over everything. They even threw me under the bus and let me rot in prison </span><span>'cause</span><span> of you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wanna know how I survived all that shit in the joint? All those beatdowns? This right here. Payback time. Can't wait to watch your whole world go up in flames."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something in Aurora's words triggered Bertha. She fought against her chains wildly, making them pull tight and screech against the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My dad's the chairman! My mom's from old money! My brother's the CEO! They'll come rescue me, and they'll destroy anyone who messes with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora let out a harsh laugh. "Chairman? Old money? The CEO? Ha! </span><span>One's</span><span> now paralyzed from a stroke, another lost an eye and I sent her to a mental hospital, and the third is rotting in prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you? Do you even look human anymore? You're nothing but trash that every man in the village used. Even pigs have more dignity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha's eyes flashed with madness when she heard this. Her screams grew more piercing. "That's not true! It can't be! I'm a wealthy heiress! I'm meant to live above everyone else! You're evil! You deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora didn't bother saying anything more. She just watched as Bertha crawled on the ground, howling in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Scream all you want. Cry all you want.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon enough, Bertha would be dead too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a shame she couldn't hear it. Those gut-wrenching wails would have been music to her ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stood quietly, watching Bertha's tortured cries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a hand shot out and grabbed her ankle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hand felt like a dead branch, rough and ice-cold, like being wrapped in the grip of some cold-blooded creature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora felt it and jumped, instinctively kicking out. Her foot connected directly with Joshua's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood immediately poured from his nose. But he acted like he couldn't feel any pain, using his last bit of strength to look up at Aurora with pleading eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lips trembled as he tried to form words. "Take... me home..."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="183.html">« Prev</a><a href="185.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
