Aurora had come to despise him, and Julian, that madman, had turned against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the heir of Sherwood Group, he had never imagined he would end up in a detention center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His brows furrowed deeper. If it hadn't been for Aurora causing a scene at Beatrice's birthday banquet, he and Bertha wouldn't have been in this mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After five years in prison, Aurora had become so unreasonable, completely unlike the gentle woman she once was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Adolph couldn't have foreseen the shame he would feel when Camille returned and the truth came to light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His blind defense of Bertha would come back to haunt him, each realization stabbing into his heart with precision, leaving him in unbearable pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overwhelming guilt would haunt him for the rest of his life, a shackle he would never break free from.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, even if he kneeled before Aurora, begging for forgiveness, she wouldn't spare him a glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of being ignored and despised was more painful than death itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, at this moment, he stubbornly clung to his stance, convinced he had done nothing wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the Hawke Estate, all eyes were on Aurora, filled with genuine concern and affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a small burn on her wrist had everyone worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice gently held Aurora's reddened wrist, filled with worry. "Julian, take Aurora to the hospital." she urged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The feeling of being cared for was both unfamiliar and comforting to Aurora. She couldn't help but crave this tenderness, secretly wishing she could spend the rest of her life with Beatrice and Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But reason quickly doused her fantasies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Beatrice wanted to match her with Julian, but her body was already failing her, like a crumbling building on the verge of collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could she selfishly tie Julian, a man with a bright future, to someone as broken as her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madam Hawke, I've already applied medicine. I'm really fine. Please don't worry about me</span><span>.</span><span>" Aurora said earnestly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Beatrice still couldn't let it go. "Burns are no small matter. What if it leaves a scar? You're frail. Such a good opportunity for a full-body check-up to put everyone's mind at ease."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since she learned about the inhumane abuse Aurora had endured in prison, including losing a kidney, Beatrice had been deeply concerned about her health. She had always wanted to take Aurora for a thorough check-up, but the busy household affairs had delayed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Julian was home, she wasn't going to miss this chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's eyes flickered with complex emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Beatrice cared for her sincerely, but she also knew that a full-body check-up would reveal the scars from prison and her deafness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want to burden the Hawke family or disrupt the peace they had found.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madam Hawke, I'm really fine</span><span>.</span><span>" Aurora insisted firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her determination, Beatrice sighed and didn't push further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gently stroked Aurora's hand and said softly, "If you feel unwell, tell me immediately. Don't suffer alone, understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes." Aurora nodded obediently, lowering her eyes to hide the tears welling up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want Beatrice to see her vulnerability, to turn this care into a burden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she looked up again, the tears were gone, replaced by a warm, resilient smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced around at everyone, their eyes filled with sincerity and concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a wave of warmth washed over her. Perhaps fate hadn't been entirely cruel to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the hardships and the estrangement from her parents, there were still people in this world who genuinely cared for her. This warmth was enough to shield her from all the coldness in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled brightly, the sunlight streaming through the large windows casting a warm glow on her, making her look radiant and healthy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, you must be hungry. I'll make breakfast with Ashley and Daisy</span><span>.</span><span>" Beatrice said softly, standing up without waiting for Aurora's response. She warmly invited Lily to sit and chat with Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the living room, only Aurora, Lily, and Julian remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily had a lot on her mind, eager to share it with Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, sitting on the sofa silently, Julian made Lily hesitate with his commanding aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly turned to Aurora and said, "Aurora, I saw some beautiful flowers outside the villa when I came in. Would you like to take a look with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora happily stood up and took Lily's hand, leading her outside. "These flowers were carefully selected and planted by Mr. Hawke," she said, her voice tinged with pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily noticed the sweetness in Aurora's expression and felt a pang of worry.</span><br><span>Has Aurora fallen for that man?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Julian seemed outstanding, her intuition told her he was dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tilted her head slightly and glanced at Julian out of the corner of her eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian was squinting, staring at the two of them quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at him, feeling as if a small deer was being watched by a fierce leopard, a chill running down her spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not until they walked out of the villa that the oppressive feeling of being stared at finally faded away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily finally breathed a sigh of relief and muttered to herself.</span><br><span>What a scary man! Better keep a </span><span>distanc</span><span>. Once you provoke him, you probably won't be able to get rid of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they walked into the garden, they were surrounded by blooming flowers, the air filled with a rich, enchanting fragrance that lifted their spirits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora." Lily suddenly stopped, looking at Aurora seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora, puzzled by Lily's solemn expression, asked softly, "What's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to leave here?" Lily's eyes were filled with determination and hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora fell silent, unsure how to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily, growing anxious, quickly added, "Last time at the hospital, you asked if I wanted to study abroad. I've thought about it, and I really do. I want to take you and mom. Once we're abroad, the </span><span>Elvador</span><span> family, the Sherwood family, and that scumbag </span><span>Hubery</span><span> won't be able to trouble you anymore. Aurora, come with me. </span><span>Orley</span><span> isn't the right place for you to stay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And..." Lily glanced around cautiously before continuing in a low voice, "I know you're doing well with the Hawke family, but such wealthy families have too many rules. I'm not saying the Hawke family is bad, but... Mr. Hawke, he's a dangerous man. Aurora, do you understand what I mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had been watching Lily's lips intently, understanding every word. She knew Lily meant well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, she often felt she shouldn't stay at the Hawke Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Hawke family owed her nothing, and while she appreciated Beatrice's intentions to match her with Julian, deep down, she didn't want to be with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her eyes, Julian was too brilliant, too dazzling. He deserved a better life, not to be dragged down by someone as broken as her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew she wouldn't last much longer. Why should she burden him?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, I understand," Aurora said softly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's eyes lit up with hope. "So, you'll come with me?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="137.html">« Prev</a><a href="139.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
