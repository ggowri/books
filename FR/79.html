"Mom, I'm sorry. </span><span>You&rsquo;re still wounded on your belly</span><span>, yet you're comforting me instead. Please go back to your room and rest, don't tire yourself out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Bertha so thoughtful, Celeste felt greatly comforted, and her original fatigue dissipated a lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gently patted Bertha's back and said softly, "Silly child, I'm fine, as long as you're okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste turned to Joshua with a serious look in her eyes. "Joshua, send more people to look for Aurora. After all, she is also your daughter. No matter what she has done, we cannot abandon her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Joshua was reluctant, he still nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Celeste took Bertha and left the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the door of the ward, she met Isabella, who had a kind expression on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste smiled, her tone polite and gentle, "Hello, Dr. Steele."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella smiled in response, "I was going to your ward to find you, but you weren't there. So I came to see Mr. Elvador. Mrs. Elvador, you look well. It seems you're already fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste said gratefully, "Thanks to your help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella's tone was somewhat serious. "It's okay. But you still need more rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha cooed to Celeste, "Mom, you should listen to the doctor. I'll take you back to your room."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste nodded and let Bertha support her as they slowly walked towards her ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella watched the departing figures of Celeste and Bertha, holding her head high with pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they had gone far, Isabella pushed open the door to Joshua's ward and then locked it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua had been impatient for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To avoid being discovered, he pulled Isabella into the bathroom. Then he tore her black stockings and eagerly pressed her against the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella also actively responded to Joshua's movements, her eyes blurred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bathroom was filled with seductive moans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five minutes later, </span><span>it was over</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Isabella left the ward, the smile on her face disappeared without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cursed, "Useless old jerk!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the next three days, Aurora stayed in Orley Caring Hospital to recuperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren appeared at the door of her ward every day on time, holding a large bouquet of flowers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora actually didn't want to see him. She was worried that the Elvador family would notice and come looking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Early on the fourth day, Ethan handled the discharge procedures for Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Less than half an hour after she left, Darren appeared with flowers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon learning the news of Aurora's discharge, he was so angry that he cursed without regard for his image, "Aurora, you have guts! I come to see you every day, yet you didn't tell me in advance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What made him even more angry was that he didn't even have Aurora's contact information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren angrily threw the flowers into the trash</span><span> can</span><span> and left the hospital in a huff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in the car, </span><span>Aurora sat in the back seat</span><span>.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan </span><span>started the car</span><span>, and </span><span>it</span><span> slowly moved through the streets of Orley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, the car stopped at a red light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora slowly rolled down the window, a breeze gently brushed her face, bringing a hint of coolness, but also blowing away the gloom that had </span><span>harbored</span><span> in her heart these days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She closed her eyes, feeling the gentle caress of the wind, and showed a long-lost ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The green light came on, and the car slowly moved forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a black Maybach came from the opposite lane, just brushing past Aurora's car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver inadvertently turned his head and happened to see Aurora closing the car window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Aurora only showed her profile, he recognized her at a glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's heart skipped a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted, "Aurora!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice stood out abruptly in the traffic, causing passersby to look sideways.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery didn't even care about traffic violations. He just wanted to keep Aurora and never let her leave again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He ignored the surrounding traffic conditions and jerked the steering wheel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's sudden lane change caused the surrounding vehicles to instantly fall into chaos, with honking sounds rising one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a loud bang, his car collided with another car. The car shook violently, but Hubery didn't notice at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery didn't bother to check his injuries, he just opened the car door and ran in the direction Aurora had left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted while running, "Aurora, </span><span>don&rsquo;t go</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The owner of the car that was hit immediately got out of the car and chased after Hubery, angrily cursing, "Stop! Are you trying to flee?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed Hubery's clothes, but Hubery mercilessly shook him off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's mind was filled with Aurora. Without thinking, he punched the man to the ground and continued to chase after Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora, sitting in the car, had just rolled up the window when she heard a loud bang from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked back, and Ethan also glanced in the rearview mirror, frowning. "There seems to be a car accident behind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's heart tightened, she faintly heard someone calling her name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sense of unease welled up in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ethan, speed up," Aurora urged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until they safely returned to Hawke Estate that Aurora felt relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice, Ashley, and Daisy had been waiting at the gate, like mother hens waiting for their beloved child to return home. As soon as they saw Aurora, they hurriedly surrounded her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when they saw Aurora's pale face, their hearts tightened at the same time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong?" Beatrice's voice was filled with concern and worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you feeling unwell somewhere?" Daisy also came up and reached out to touch Aurora's forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley also looked anxious. "Aurora, why do you look so bad?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing the concerned gazes of the three, Aurora was deeply moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shook her head, wanting to explain, but before she could speak, Ethan took the lead. "Ms. Elvador was frightened by the car accident just now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three were startled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice quickly checked Aurora's body. "Aurora, are you hurt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora quickly held Beatrice's hand and comforted her, "Madam Hawke, I'm fine. It was someone else who had a car accident."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did they breathe a sigh of relief, and the expressions on their faces relaxed a lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Hubery had been subdued by the police.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was still looking around, searching for Aurora's figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until the police put him in the police car that he realized he had caused big </span><span>trouble</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was facing charges of hit-and-run.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="78.html">« Prev</a><a href="80.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
