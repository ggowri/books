If you forgive me, I will do anything </span><span>for you.</span><span>" Celeste pleaded, tears flowing uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora coldly stared at Celeste, her lips tightly closed, not saying a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with Aurora's icy indifference, Celeste was utterly devastated. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nearly crawled toward her, stretching her arms as far as they would go, looking like a drowning person clutching at their last chance of survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to touch Aurora, to hold her, to make her feel how truly remorseful she was. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before her fingertips could even brush the hem of Aurora's clothes, Ethan grabbed her and yanked her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora!" Celeste wailed, sobbing uncontrollably, tears running down her face in messy streaks. "I've begged you this much... Can't you show me a little pity?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora clenched her jaw and spat out each word, slow and deliberate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pity you? Do you even hear yourself? Isn</span><span>'</span><span>t that ironic? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When Bertha drugged me the night of the auction and nearly ruined my purity, did any of you feel any pity for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste froze as if struck by lightning. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes flickered with panic as memories came rushing back, replaying that night in her mind over and over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, she, Joshua, and Barnett had stood in front of Aurora, who had just barely escaped from Bertha's scheme, and instead of standing up for her, they had taken Bertha's side. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They accused Aurora of being unreasonable and of plotting to frame Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Driven to the edge, Aurora had snapped. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had tackled Bertha to the ground and bashed her with an ashtray. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But later, things got even worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Celeste thought about what came after, it was as if all the strength drained from her body. She collapsed to the floor, limp and lifeless like a deflated balloon, unable to even meet Aurora's gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora smiled coldly</span><span>,</span><span> "Mrs. Celeste Elvador, you</span><span>'</span><span>ve remembered, haven</span><span>'</span><span>t you? That night you hit me with an ashtray, nearly causing me to lose consciousness. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That night, the rain was pouring heavily. You threw Daisy outside the villa, letting her beg, asking you to feel sorry for me because I was your biological daughter. But your family ignored her completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You left me lying on the cold floor. If I hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t woken up in the middle of the night and forced my weak body to leave that house, I would</span><span>'</span><span>ve died there. How could there be any talk of today</span><span>'</span><span>s revenge?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For so many years, I kept wondering was it my fault? Was I just not good enough? Is that why you all hated me so much? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But then I realized, it was never about me. The truth is, none of you are even remotely human. All I did was put you all where you guys belong. If anything, all of you should be grateful I didn't make you suffer the way you made me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's words hit Celeste like hammer blows, each syllable driving deeper into her chest. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The countless cruelties they had inflicted on Aurora resurfaced, each memory like a dull knife cutting her open, piece by piece. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart felt like it was being torn apart, the pain so suffocating she could barely breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And in that moment, Celeste finally understood that she didn't even deserve to say sorry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The things she had done to her own daughter were so monstrous that even the deepest pits of hell wouldn't be punishment enough.</span><span> </span><span>She didn't deserve forgiveness. She had no right to ask for Aurora's pity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, when Aurora had lived like less than a stray dog in the Elvador Villa, Celeste had never once spared her a shred of mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Celeste was dragged away by Ethan, her body limp as he pulled her along. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her feet scraped against the floor, leaving faint marks behind. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were empty as if her soul had already left her body, leaving nothing but a hollow shell behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, it was Joshua and Bertha's turn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua had already fallen into despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Aurora didn't even spare her </span><span style="font-style: italic;">birth</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> mother. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And me? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The one responsible for her entire tragedy? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why would she show me any mercy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua couldn't move, and he couldn't even speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he could do was look at Aurora with pleading, remorseful eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't waver in the slightest. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If murder were legal, she would've gladly torn this bastard apart with her own hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take them away. I don't want to see their faces," Aurora ordered coldly, her voice devoid of emotion. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment she spoke, Daniel stepped forward to grab Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha, already a trembling mess, shrieked in panic, "No! I don't want to go to that place!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel didn't bother being gentle. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed her like she was nothing more than a squawking chicken. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She kicked and thrashed wildly, her eyes blown wide with terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was about to haul her out of the villa, Bertha suddenly screamed, "Aurora! You can't do this to me! Your kidney is still inside my body! If you let me go, I'll give it back to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment those words left her mouth, Daniel froze mid-step and turned to look at Julian and Aurora, waiting for their response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha, on the other hand, felt a surge of hope. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Aurora with desperate anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone assumed Aurora would compromise for the sake of her kidney. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, she sneered, blinking those bright eyes of hers, which now carried an icy edge. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She spoke slowly, her words laced with mockery, "And why would I take my kidney back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, the room instantly fell silent. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could wrap their heads around what she had just said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That's your kidney. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">You're just going to let her keep it? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Just like that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha stared at Aurora in shock, her face twisted with confusion. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stammering, she asked, "Y-You don't want your own kidney back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's smile deepened, but it sent chills down everyone's spine. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, I want it back, of course. I just never said I had to take it right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tone remained steady and unhurried as she continued, "I'm living a perfectly happy life as I am. One kidney is more than enough for me. But you? You only have one left. If I take it back now, you'll die immediately, and I'll be labeled a murderer. That wouldn't be very fun, would it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I'll wait. I'll let you rot in that hellhole, struggling with just one kidney. And after you've suffered, after you've been chewed up and spit out by the world&mdash;do you really think you'll outlive me? When you finally drop dead, I'll take back what's mine. I get my kidney back, all fair and legal. So, why rush?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha's face instantly twisted with shock and fear as she processed Aurora's words. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It finally dawned on her&mdash;Aurora hated her, hated her to the core, so much so that she was willing to torment her in such a cruel way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Aurora didn't want to dirty her own hands. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why she had come up with this plan&mdash;to throw Bertha into the mountains and let her suffer in that godforsaken place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha had been pampered like a princess since birth, never having endured a single hardship. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she were thrown into the wilderness, she would suffer immensely. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body, fragile and unused to any form of hardship, would deteriorate day by day. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And if the men in the mountains decided to take advantage of her, forcing her into pregnancy, the burden on her already weak body would only grow heavier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mere thought sent violent tremors through her entire body. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She started thrashing, screaming desperately, "No! You can't do this to me! Even if you torture me to death, I will never agree to donate my organs! You still won't get my kidney!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora arched a brow. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether you agree or not doesn't matter. As long as your biological parents sign the organ donation papers after you're dead, that's all I need."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha felt like she was staring at a demon that had crawled straight out of hell. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's methods had become terrifyingly ruthless&mdash;far beyond anything she had ever imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Bertha didn't know was that Aurora had learned all of this from her and Joshua.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora smirked.</span><br><span>Since these two had once plotted to leave me brain-dead and harvest my organs, it was only fair to return the favor. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'll let Bertha experience what it feels like to be carved out piece by piece. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That will be the best revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha shook her head frantically, her voice cracking. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! My parents would never agree to it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella and Frank glared at Aurora, their fury barely contained. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't even think about it, you little bitch! We'd rather die than agree!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora let out a cold, taunting laugh. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you refuse to donate Bertha's organs, I have plenty of ways to deal with your son abroad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tilted her head, feigning deep thought as she said, "Guns aren't banned overseas, and weed is legal. What should I do with him, hmm?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The casual way she said it sent a chill down their spines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, as if struck by a sudden idea, Aurora's eyes lit up and she chirped, "Oh! Since my kidney and Bertha's turned out to be a match, do you think I'd be a match for your son too? What do you say? Should I pay him a little visit?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="149.html">« Prev</a><a href="151.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
