But remember, if someone has ill intentions towards you and deliberately bullies you, don't put up with it. You don't owe kindness to such people. Stand up for yourself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And if there's something you like and don't want to share, you're perfectly entitled to keep it to yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confused, I asked, "Mommy, won't I be a bad girl?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mother gently stroked my head and murmured, "Your top priority is to protect yourself. Being a good kid comes second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Baby, keep in mind that your father and I strive so hard and reach the peak of the social ladder to shield ourselves and you from any harm. We are your most powerful support. We shouldn't initiate conflicts, but we won't back down from them either. Got it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the time, I did not fully understand her words, but knowing that she would do me no harm, I firmly trusted them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, whenever facing difficulties, I was never self-abased or depressed. And at school, no one dared to pick on me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was partly due to my personality, but I was also aware that my prominent family background played a role.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nevertheless, I have never misused my influence to boss around anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I enjoyed a great time in kindergarten and was happy each day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recently, though, I'd been spotting a strange man, about my father's age, tall and handsome, who bore some resemblance to my mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He often appeared near my school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'd seen him numerous times on my way to and from school. Each time I caught sight of him, he was staring right at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>About half a month later, the driver who was supposed to pick me up was late that day. All the other children had already been taken away, and I was the only one left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strange man approached me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at me affectionately and didn't seem like a bad guy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aria," he murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staring at him in confusion, I asked, "Sir, do you know me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm your uncle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uncle?" I furrowed my brows in doubt. "You're lying. You're not my uncle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face contorted with pain as he explained, "Aria, I'm truly your uncle. How about I take you home?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he reached out to carry me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But because he was a stranger to me, I refused to let him touch me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My parents had told me not to go with strangers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I promptly dashed behind the teacher, clung to her leg, and exclaimed, "Madam, I don't know him. He must be a human trafficker. Please call the police and have him arrested right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett stopped dead in his tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His past life memories didn't hit him full force until after Celeste died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those nightmares that tortured him in prison? They were all real&mdash;scenes from his previous life playing on repeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every day was pure hell, and all he wanted was to find Aurora and make things right. But after watching Celeste die without forgiveness, he just couldn't face her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew damn well he'd hurt Aurora just as bad as Celeste had. If Aurora couldn't forgive Celeste, what chance did he have?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett stayed in Orley for many years, suffering every day throughout that time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his desire not to upset Aurora's life, he couldn't help but come to Putnam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he could only catch a glimpse of Aurora from afar and behold her happiness with his own eyes, it would be a pleasure for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was precisely because of his trip to Putnam that he discovered Aurora and Julian already had a daughter named Aria Hawke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her name and appearance were the same as before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the previous life, Aurora died without knowing that she had a daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this life, she </span><span>finally </span><span>led a blissful life with those who cherished her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Barnett, not getting Aurora to forgive him was his biggest regret. Close second was failing to win over his only niece in his last life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He and Adolph still lived in the old villa that Aurora once stayed in, spending their days missing her until they died a few years later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time around, seeing Aria again lit him up inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't planned on showing himself&mdash;just watching her from a distance would've been enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But today her ride was running super late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw Aria at the school gate, looking all lonely and lost, he couldn't help himself. He had to go to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just didn't expect her to be so on guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately explained, "Aria, I'm really not a bad guy. Believe me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria didn't buy his words and commanded the security guards, "Catch him. He's trying to abduct me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The security guards were cognizant that Aria was the daughter of Aurora and Julian, the little princess cherished by the Hawke family and the Barron family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone who dared to kidnap Aria was simply courting death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The security guards seized Barnett</span><span> right away</span><span>. Without giving him a chance to explain, they sent him to the police station. Despite his numerous attempts, the security guards remained unyielding and refused to listen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria looked at Barnett, who was struggling </span><span>hard</span><span>, her expression cold and indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tilted her head. Somehow, his sad face upset her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria furrowed her brows and surmised that it must be this strange man who had spoiled her mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Trying to abduct me? Dream on!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the car from the Hawke family finally pulled over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria climbed into the car. Through the window, she could still observe Barnett persistently trying to explain the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She returned to the Hawke Estate and ran in cheerfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great-grandma, I'm back from school."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice grinned from ear to ear at the sight of Aria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Baby, you're back. Slow down and be careful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria threw herself into Beatrice's arms and rubbed her little face against her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice asked, "Baby, how was your day at school? Did you have a good time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria nodded obediently. "Yes, I had a good time as usual. But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what?" Beatrice asked curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria replied truthfully, "I met a strange man at the school gate. He said he was my uncle and tried to take me away."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="248.html">« Prev</a><a href="250.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
