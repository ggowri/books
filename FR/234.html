He's your own brother! Now that you're back on your feet, can you really have the heart to let him rot in jail over something that isn't even that big of a deal?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're the youngest whiz-kid scientist in </span><span>Peloland</span><span>. I bet if you put in a good word with the court, they'd go easy on him.</span><span> </span><span>Just cut him some slack for the sake of family, please?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora suddenly roared, her eyes blazing with fury, "Enough already!</span><span> </span><span>Cut him some slack? Who gave a damn about me when I was going through hell?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I know </span><span>he's</span><span> my brother. But what kind of brother teams up with others to steal my kidney? That's just messed up!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In my past life, he framed me, and I </span><span>ended up in jail for five years</span><span>. Before that, he gave me grief for three whole years in the </span><span>Elvador</span><span> family. Even after I got out, he just kept on putting me down.</span><span>"</span><span> </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The fact that I haven't come after him for payback in this life should be seen as me being lenient. If he hadn't stirred the pot, I wouldn't even acknowledge he exists."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what did he do? He tried to take my kidney and leave me a wreck, and you still expect me to just forgive and forget?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Celeste, you've got to know how much I loathe the thought of being disabled. In my past life, your family reduced me to a shadow of who I used to be. Do you really think I can just roll over and take it again?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled up in Celeste's eyes and streamed down her face as she shook her head vigorously. "No</span><span>. T</span><span>hat's not what I'm saying at all!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora let out a scornful scoff. "Barnett's not a little kid anymore. He's a grown-up, and he's </span><span>gotta</span><span> face the </span><span>outcome for</span><span> what he's done.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But don't you fret. He's an accomplice, so he won't get the death penalty for this. He'll just do a few years behind bars. It's not the end of the world."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's eyes popped wide open in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that line all too well.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, Barnett had said the exact same thing to Aurora.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's five years in prison? You're just sitting in jail, but Camille's a vegetable."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste couldn't bring herself to meet Aurora's gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora continued, "Since Barnett thinks prison's no biggie, let him have a taste of it for himself. I'm sure he'll see things differently once he's in there.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you worry. I'm not going to pull any strings to torture him. All he'll lose is his freedom. I lost a leg and a kidney in my last life. He's got it a whole lot better than I did."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste just stood there, dumbfounded, her mind a complete blank.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora shouldered past her and walked out of the room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she stepped out of the room, she bumped into a tall figure.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked up in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never </span><span>in a million years thought she'd run into </span><span>Adolph </span><span>at the hospital</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the guy who'd hurt her in her past life, but compared to the hell the </span><span>Elvador</span><span> family and Hubery had put her through, his actions were just a drop in the bucket.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was caught off guard and didn't know what to do at first.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph, sharp as a tack in his sleek black suit, couldn't tear his eyes away from her the moment he saw her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most folks wouldn't give scientists a second look, but Adolph was a cut above the rest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd heard about Aurora's reputation since his school days.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd always been proud of his top-notch grades, but next to her genius, he felt like a fish out of water.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though they were the same age, while Aurora was already hitting the books at college, he was still playing with toys in kindergarten.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In more ways than one, Aurora was his idol, and he was a die-hard fan.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly</span><span> finding himself wrapped in his idol's embrace, Adolph was so stoked that his whole face turned as red as a beet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing right beside him, Camille let out a gasp of surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow! Adolph, is this really your idol, Aurora? I just saw a news report about her yesterday, and now here she is!</span><span> </span><span>She's even more stunning in person than on TV!" Camille gazed at Aurora with shining eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora shook herself from her thoughts, her expression neutral, and her tone cool.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could you let go of me now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph snapped back to reality, realizing he was still holding Aurora's slender waist, their bodies pressed together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her waist was so tiny and soft, and the scent of her shampoo mixed with body wash was intoxicating.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, he didn't want to let go.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Adolph could gather his wits, a firm hand suddenly pushed him aside, pulling Aurora into a strong embrace.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice that followed was cold and unyielding. "What were you planning to do with my fianc&eacute;e?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Aurora gone, a sense of emptiness washed over Adolph, and his heart plummeted like a stone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to face the newcomer and froze.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Julian, the heir of the prestigious Hawke family in Putnam.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph didn't like him at all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd seen online that Aurora was engaged to this very prince of the Hawke family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph knew he could never measure up to Aurora; to him, she was like the brightest moon&mdash;untouchable and distant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Julian may be impressive, but he's just a businessman. What gives him the right to pursue a genius like Aurora?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Besides, they were just childhood friends who haven't seen each other in eight years.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The whole 'fianc&eacute;e' thing is child's play, just a game we played as kids.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, Adolph eyed Aurora with a worried look. He was on high alert, ready to jump in and protect her if Julian even thought about giving her a hard time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, as he stole a glance at her, he was floored to see her eyes light up like a Christmas tree at the sight of Julian.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian, now a sprightly twenty-two, still had that boyish charm that could make heads turn, but there was also a newfound calm and poise that came with maturity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, Aurora had been through the wringer, and Julian had been her knight in shining armor, a ray of hope in the pitch-black darkness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The little boy she once knew had finally come into his own.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, he recognized her right off the bat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The coldness in Julian's eyes melted away, replaced by a warm glow as he made his way towards Aurora.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, you're finally back," he said, his voice soft as silk.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached out, his fingers grazing her face ever so gently, tracing the contours of her young features.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've missed you like crazy all these years."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora gave him a tender smile. "Me</span><span>,</span><span> too. I've missed </span><span>you</span><span> loads."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then..." Julian's eyes were swimming with emotion. "Let's head back to Putnam and get engaged."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Aurora was about to give the okay, a tall figure came charging toward her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swooped her up in a bear hug. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora? Is it really you? My sweet little sis is finally back! I've been missing you like crazy!" William was blubbering, completely overcome with feelings.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once chubby and adorable little sister had blossomed into a young woman.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, Laura came dashing over too. "My daughter! My precious angel!" She squeezed Aurora tight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Benjamin couldn't keep his emotions in check. He opened his arms wide, pulling Laura, William, and Aurora into a big family embrace.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, </span><span>a</span><span>fter you left the research institute, you came to Orley and got yourself kidnapped! Do you have any idea how worried sick I was? What if something bad had happened to you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air was filled with a mix of laughter and tears as the family hugged it out, over the moon with happiness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste stepped out of the </span><span>ward</span><span>, watching this heart-warming reunion unfold. In an instant, she felt like a fifth wheel.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her own daughter had pushed her to the sidelines.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="233.html">« Prev</a><a href="235.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
