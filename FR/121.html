When the two least expected it, she suddenly struck and kicked the young man accurately in the vitals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a scream instantly, covering his crotch with both hands and rolling on the ground in pain. His testicles were crushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young lady was so frightened by the sudden turn of events that her face turned pale with shock. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as a terrified scream was about to escape her lips, Lily rushed forward in a flash. The brick in her hand rained down on the young lady's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were several crisp cracking sounds. Four of the </span><span>woman</span><span>'s front teeth flew out along with splashes of blood, and her nasal bone broke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She also collapsed to the ground, wailing non-stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After doing all this, Lily didn't stay for a second. She quickly found a secluded and unoccupied corner and took off her outer clothes, gloves, and mask one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took out a lighter she had prepared in advance and lit it, watching as these evidences were consumed by the flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, the couple reported the incident to the police. The police carefully examined the grove for a long time, but no clue at the scene could point to Lily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So the matter was left unresolved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason why Lily retaliated so brutally against this couple wasn't because she was </span><span>heartbroken over the one million dollars she didn't get but out of deep pity for Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The longer it took to free Aurora from her pain, the more suffering Aurora had to endure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those two stupid jerks who dared to make Aurora suffer should also suffer. That was the real reason Lily beat them up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, at Hawke Estate, Aurora hadn't stepped out of the gate for a full seven days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She spent every day focused on embroidering The Garden for Beatrice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the seventh day, Daniel finally returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Julian's study, the atmosphere was so oppressive that it was hard to breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel gently placed a thick stack of documents on the desk. The sound of the paper rubbing against each other was particularly clear in the silent room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawke, all the information about the Elvador family is here," said Daniel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian slowly reached out his hand and flipped through the pages one by one with his long fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he read on, he frowned tighter and tighter. His originally cold face was covered with a gloomy look, and his expression grew increasingly terrible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The information about Aurora that Ethan had found last time had already made Julian feel distressed about Aurora's bumpy life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, what Daniel had investigated this time was like a huge tempest, completely shattering Julian's perception.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Aurora had experienced was far more tragic than Julian had imagined.</span><span> Her life in the past was basically a living hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's hand clenched involuntarily. His heart was filled with mixed emotions. There was pity for Aurora's tragic experience and anger towards the heartless people in the Elvador family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long silence, Julian stood up and picked up all the documents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel looked at him and couldn't help asking, "Mr. Hawke, this </span><span>truth is so harsh</span><span>. Ms. Elvador might not be able to bear it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A complex emotion appeared in Julian's eyes. "She has already endured so much pain. She should know the reason for her suffering. </span><span>Well, we shouldn&rsquo;t keep her in the dark</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Julian walked out of the study and headed toward Aurora's embroidery room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always been cold-hearted and decisive in the business world. When facing the schemes of his opponents, he was sharp and resolute, never hesitating or backing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, standing in front of the door of Aurora's embroidery room, he didn't dare to push the door open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian had imagined countless times in his mind what expression Aurora would have when she </span><span>learned</span><span> </span><span>these cruel truths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would it be a shock? Pain? Or despair?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each </span><span>scenario</span><span> </span><span>was like a blunt knife, slowly grinding at the tip of his heart, making Julian feel a dull ache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Julian's hesitant look, Daniel </span><span>was shocked and curious</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having been by Julian's side for so many years, Daniel was all too familiar with Julian's ruthless methods. But it was the first time Daniel had seen Julian care so much about a woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, during the in-depth investigation, Daniel couldn't help but feel sorry for Aurora's experience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had seen the darkness of human nature, but people like the Elvador family, who targeted their biological daughter, eager to devour her flesh, drink her blood, and squeeze out all her value, were something he had seen for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the two were hesitating, the door of the embroidery room suddenly creaked open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>W</span><span>hen </span><span>Aurora</span><span> </span><span>saw Daniel, </span><span>astonishment crept over her face</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she quickly looked at the documents in Julian's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>S</span><span>he instantly understood that Daniel, who had been missing for seven days, must have figured out all the mysteries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you found out?" Aurora's voice was slightly hoarse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian nodded slightly. "It's all here. Do you want to see it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From his expression, Aurora guessed that the content in the documents might be even more terrifying than she had imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She involuntarily clenched the corner of her clothes with her hands, and her heart started pounding rapidly, thumping wildly in her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she had always tried to be strong, facing the truth that was about to be revealed, fear welled up in her heart like a tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..." Aurora opened her mouth, but her voice seemed to be stuck in her throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a deep breath, trying to calm herself down. "I want to know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tone was trembling yet also carried an unwavering determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A look of hesitation flashed in Julian's eyes, but he had to hand the documents in his hand to Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora slowly reached out and took them, feeling the stack of papers as heavy as a thousand pounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She opened the first page and scanned the words on it. Her face instantly turned deathly pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The documents detailed all the schemes and persecutions the Elvador family had inflicted on her over the years. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once-vague memories were catalyzed by these words and became incredibly clear now, replaying like a nightmare in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had always thought that she was stolen after birth by vile human traffickers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the information showed that it was her biological father, Joshua, who had left her at the orphanage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had always thought that Bertha was an adopted daughter that Joshua and Celeste had taken in because they were too heartbroken after losing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the information mercilessly revealed that Bertha was the daughter of Joshua and Isabella.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua had had an affair with Isabella, the female doctor who was doing Celeste's </span><span>prenatal check-ups when Celeste was pregnant with Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To make room for the child Isabella was carrying, Joshua heartlessly left Aurora, who had just been born, at the entrance of the orphanage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the following twenty-odd years, Joshua had also gradually helped Isabella rise to the position of hospital director.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Joshua." Aurora gritted her teeth, and tears welled up in her eyes, blurring her vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a deep breath, forced back all the tears, and continued to read the content of the documents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Isabella had hereditary kidney disease and happened to be a perfect match with Celeste. When Celeste had a cesarean section, Joshua made a snap decision to also have Isabella, who was pregnant with Bertha, have a cesarean section. The bribed surgeon removed Celeste's kidney during the cesarean section and transplanted it into Isabella's body.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stared at these words, stunned, and her mind went blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder during the three years Aurora had returned to the Elvador Villa, Celeste had always had a backache and got tired easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whenever Aurora and Bertha argued, Celeste would scold Aurora, "If it weren't for giving birth to you, my body wouldn't be so bad. Can't you get along well with Bertha now that you're back? Do you have to make me angry on purpose? </span><span>You wanna see me die</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So Celeste's backache and fatigue weren't because of giving birth to Aurora at all but because Bertha's mother needed her kidney, and Celeste had abused her biological daughter for the daughter of her enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora suddenly burst into laughter, tears coming out of her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her laughter was filled with endless sadness and mockery.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="120.html">« Prev</a><a href="122.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
