After what nearly happened last time, she probably wanted to avoid him at all costs. There was no way she would willingly go home with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly dropped his teasing tone and said, "I'll take you to a hotel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily did not refuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the car, the atmosphere felt heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gazed out the window, her face emotionless. The streetlights flickered past, casting fragmented shadows on her features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan glanced at her through the rearview mirror. Seeing her cold and distant demeanor, he sighed helplessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It seems that my behavior last time really scared her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could understand that. After all, Lily was just a university student, simple, innocent, and timid. It was better for him to stop making inappropriate jokes, or she might really think he was some kind of pervert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he didn't realize was that if Lily hadn't mistaken him for being gay, she would have already made a move on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car soon arrived at the hotel. Ethan parked and got out first, opening the door for Lily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he walked into the hotel and helped her check-in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once everything was settled, he pulled out the bank card he had failed to give her last time and handed it to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was wrong before," Ethan said, his voice low and sincere, laced with guilt. He added, "I truly want to apologize. This card is a token of my sincerity. I hope you'll accept it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to keep his tone gentle, forcing the card into Lily's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily was momentarily stunned, her gaze falling on the card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't expected him to still give it to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I don't need this," she said slowly, her voice still cool. But only she knew how much she longed for the money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, she had to keep up appearances. Her image had to stay intact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When it was time to act, she had to commit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take it back." She handed the card back to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan had expected her actions. She was stubborn and disobedient </span><span>even,</span><span> she still had the innocence of a university student.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was turning down a million dollars without hesitation. Most people wouldn't be able to do that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's impression of Lily improved even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least all his efforts tonight weren't in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With firm insistence, he pushed her hand away. "I said it's yours, it's yours. If you don't want it, throw it in the trash."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone left no room for argument, his gaze carrying a hint of dominance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, it's late. Get some rest. I should head back." Ethan said, turning to leave. As he did, he raised an eyebrow, feeling secretly pleased.</span><br><span>I must have looked incredibly cool. Maybe I even managed to make her swoon a little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he didn't know was that behind him, Lily was watching his retreating figure with amusement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled slightly, a teasing glint in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her evaluation of him was simple.</span><br><span>He is dumb, silly, and ridiculously fun to mess with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just because he was being so generous, she would temporarily forgive him for being friends with scumbags like Barnett and Darren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as he didn't provoke Aurora, she would let him be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling much better, Lily tucked the bank card away carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tomorrow, she would find Aurora and discuss leaving the country.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though her mother said the Hawke family treated Aurora well, she knew that relying on others was never a good idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially men, one day, they might adore you and treat you like a queen, but the moment they lose interest, they can turn cold and take everything back without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was sure that after everything Aurora had been through, she had long since given up on men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She slept soundly through the night, and as dawn broke, the sky outside gradually brightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily woke up early, freshened up quickly, and left for the Hawke Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yesterday, she had already gotten their address from her mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her bond with Aurora wasn't just a coincidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Aurora, in the entire </span><span>Elvador</span><span> family, only Daisy had ever truly cared about her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Lily? Back when Aurora was about to take her Scholastic Assessment Test, Lily had braved a downpour to deliver her exam admission ticket, only to fall and break her right hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of that injury, she struggled during her Secondary School Admission Test, writing slowly that she missed several major questions. She could have gotten into a prestigious high school, but she was only admitted to an average one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had blamed herself for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neither Daisy nor Lily owed her anything, yet they had always treated her sincerely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why, after getting out of prison, when the </span><span>Elvador</span><span> family used Daisy and Lily to threaten her, she endured it all in silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want them to suffer because of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Lily, Aurora wasn't just a friend. She was also a mentor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was a freshman in high school while Lily had just entered middle school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily, before meeting Aurora, had always had average grades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to Aurora&rsquo;s tutoring, she could become the top student in her grade, for consecutive three years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From her first to third year of middle school, she consistently ranked first in her grade, earning scholarships every year and significantly easing her mother's financial burden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the Secondary School Admission Test, her injured hand slowed her down, missing out on a top school. But even when Aurora was in prison, she hadn't forgotten about Lily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During her mother's visits, Aurora had asked her to bring all her high school notes to Lily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why Lily had managed to get into </span><span>Orley</span><span> University of Technology, one of the most prestigious universities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">A woman as kind and brilliant as Aurora shouldn't have to endure mistreatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily was determined to take her away, far from those who sought to hurt her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Hawke Estate, Aurora slowly opened her eyes, still feeling a little dazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She remembered waiting in the living room for Julian to come back. She had only meant to take a short rest because she was too exhausted, but before she knew it, she opened her eyes to find that morning had arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked around and found herself lying in her room. She knew it must be Julian who brought her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face heated up at the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since coming to the Hawke Estate, she had been relying on him too much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora felt a little guilty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to do something for Julian, but he lacked nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking for a moment, she decided to make him breakfast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She washed up and went downstairs. Before heading to the kitchen, she unlocked the front door, just in case Ethan and Daniel arrived and rang the bell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Lily had just arrived at the Hawke Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tilted her head back, studying the grand estate before her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The off-white marble walls shimmered under the sunlight, exuding a soft yet noble elegance. Every corner was adorned with intricate carvings, a testament to its unparalleled luxury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Towering columns supported the grand entrance, their wrought-iron designs finely detailed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The front yard was filled with blooming flowers, their fragrance thick in the air. Each petal was flawless, layered like a meticulously crafted masterpiece.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at all this, Lily couldn't help but wonder.</span><br><span>In such an extravagant place, is Aurora living well?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, she stepped forward and rang the doorbell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even after a long wait, no one answered. Frowning, she wondered.</span><br><span>Is everyone still asleep?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hesitating, she pushed the door. To her surprise, it opened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hesitated for a moment but still walked in. As she entered the living room, a rich aroma filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walking toward the kitchen, she saw Aurora busy at the stove.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes welled up with tears as she softly called out, "Aurora."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="133.html">« Prev</a><a href="135.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
