Last time around, she had paid dearly for her mistakes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She owed Aurora everything, and in that lifetime, she had repaid every ounce of debt.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a desperate cry, Celeste lunged forward, wrapping her arms tightly around the small frame of Aurora.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, don't leave me. Please, I know I made a mistake. Can you forgive me? Please forgive me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her sobs were gut-wrenching, each word punctuated by gasps and sniffles. The scene left the spectators feeling pity welling up inside them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well," one murmured softly to another, "she is Ms. Barron's biological mother after all. And back then, it was Joshua, the real scumbag, who abandoned Ms. Barron. It wasn't entirely Mrs. Elvador's fault."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly," another agreed, nodding emphatically. "Only mothers who've lost children can truly understand what this must feel like. I think we should let her have her daughter back."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah," others whispered in agreement.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their voices were audible enough to ripple through the room like an undertone of sympathy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura stood frozen, her mind going blank except for the overwhelming ache in her chest. Her eyes locked onto Aurora's figure, brimming with longing and sorrow.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to grab Aurora and hold her close, but deep down, she knew better. Celeste, flawed though she might be, was still Aurora's birth mother. Despite her failures as a parent, the love Celeste seemed to radiate toward Aurora felt genuine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Am I really about to lose my precious daughter forever?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mere thought sent a sharp pang through Laura's heart. Her nose stung, and her eyes welled up instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperation tinged her voice as she reached out, speaking timidly, "Aurora, come here, sweetheart. Come to Mommy." Every word trembled with hope and fear that Aurora would refuse.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before anyone could react, William stepped forward, his expression darkening with a furious glare directed at Celeste. "You're not a good mother," he spat venomously. "Just the other day at the children's clothing store, you tried to hit my sister because of some other girl! Aurora, don't go with her!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Aurora shoved Celeste away. Caught off guard, Celeste stumbled backward, landing hard on the floor with a thud.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora loomed over Celeste and shot her an icy stare. "In my last life, you drained every ounce of hope I ever had for you. In this life, I refuse to be your daughter again. I only have one mother, and that's Mrs. Barron!" Aurora whispered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those final words, Aurora turned on her heel.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" Celeste screamed, lunging forward to grab Aurora's arm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" she yelled, clinging desperately. "You're my daughter! You came from my body! How can you do this to me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slowly, Aurora turned back, her eyes glittering with bitter mockery.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste flinched under that piercing stare, shame washing over her like a tidal wave.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't deserve to demand anything from Aurora, not after the way she had treated Aurora in their previous lives.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, Celeste had showered all her affection on Bertha, treating Aurora worse than the hired help.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go," Aurora commanded coldly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Celeste clung on stubbornly, refusing to give up. "I won't let go!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, William sprang into action. With a fierce growl, he lunged forward, sinking his teeth into Celeste's hand where it gripped Aurora's wrist.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pain shot through Celeste, forcing her grip to loosen instinctively.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seizing the opportunity, William grabbed Aurora's hand and bolted, dragging her straight back to where Benjamin and Laura stood waiting.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin scooped Aurora into his arms protectively, pulling her close while wrapping his other arm around his wife, who was now crying tears of relief. His gaze hardened, turning glacial as he addressed the intruders. "Throw these lunatics out."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, burly security guards descended upon Celeste and Joshua, hauling them away without mercy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's screams echoed through the hall, but no one paid her any mind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The banquet hall fell silent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin's steely gaze swept across the crowd, lingering particularly on those who had sided with Celeste moments earlier. His cold stare seemed to freeze the very air around them, pinning them in place with its unspoken threat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those guests felt the full force of his disdain. One by one, they dropped their gazes in a silent plea for mercy. Their hearts were racing, pounding out a frantic rhythm as they prayed to themselves.</span><br><span>Please, Mr. Barron, have a heart. Let us off with a warning. Forgive our cowardice and spare us your wrath.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, they had only acted out of pity for the underdog. Malice? No, they harbored no ill intent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that was precisely the problem. Without even a whisper of the truth, they had pointed fingers, passing judgment with the reckless abandon of children. As adults, shouldn't they have had the discernment to question? Instead, they let themselves be swept away by Celeste's honeyed words. Fools like that had no business standing shoulder to shoulder with the Barron family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To partner with such people would be to chain an anchor to the Barron family, dragging it down into the muck of their incompetence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin's face betrayed nothing, his expression looking cool and unruffled. But when he spoke, his words fell like a brutal blow that left them reeling.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone who sympathized with that woman may leave now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Heads snapped up, eyes widening in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just for daring to speak out of turn, they were being dismissed outright.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their reputations were tarnished, and their business ties were severed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They opened their mouths to protest, but the moment their gazes met Benjamin's frigid stare, their courage crumbled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once those disgraced figures slunk away, tails between their legs, the banquet hall felt suddenly cavernous.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the fools excised, a serene hush descended over the room. The banquet resumed, gliding forward with effortless grace.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the jarring interlude of Joshua and Celeste's disruption, the evening soon regained its rhythm, unfolding with seamless elegance as if the storm had never passed through.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, outside the villa gates, Celeste and Joshua continued their futile attempts to regain entry. No matter how loudly they pounded or pleaded, there was no response.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Celeste spun around, her eyes blazing with hatred so intense that it seemed to solidify into something tangible.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under her icy eyes that looked ready to devour him whole, Joshua recoiled instinctively. Fear gripped him, sending him stumbling back two steps.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, listen to me!" he begged, raising his hands defensively.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is there to explain? You dumped our daughter at an orphanage!" she shrieked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, I get it now," she sneered. "Your whole plan was to bring your bastard child home and make me raise her instead. Am I right? Tell me, weren't you thrilled watching me play mommy to your illegitimate brat?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all your fault! Everything is on you!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a feral scream, Celeste pounced, her nails raking across his face. Blood gushed freely, streaming down his cheeks in crimson rivers.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You crazy bitch! Stop this!" he shouted, trying to fend her off.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She laughed maniacally, her voice dripping with madness. "Crazy bitch? Yes, that's exactly what I am. I went insane long ago."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Insanity had taken root in her soul since the day Aurora had been cast into that orphanage in her past life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, fueled by rage, Celeste unleashed every ounce of pent-up fury upon the man before her, catching Joshua, a man twice her size, completely off guard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pinned him to the ground and pummeled him mercilessly, her fists flying in relentless succession.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each punch landed harder than the last, memories of Aurora's suffering flashing vividly in her mind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Aurora was her biological daughter, Celeste refused to give Aurora a single penny, yet she raised Bertha's allowance to a staggering million dollars.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Bertha who had cruelly pushed Camille down the stairs, leaving her in a vegetative state. Celeste erased the surveillance footage with her own hands just to clear Bertha of blame.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha ceaselessly provoked Aurora, but their family treated Aurora with nothing but beatings and curses, driving her to the point where she cut off one of her own fingers simply to sever ties with them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha drugged Aurora, attempting to ruin her. When Aurora fought back against Bertha, Celeste actually smashed Aurora over the head with an ashtray until blood streamed down her face. She even left Aurora there on the cold floor to fend for herself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These unbearable images tormented Celeste so deeply that death felt like sweet relief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how much agony consumed her soul, she couldn't bring herself to give up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was reborn. In this life, she had a family who cherished her and a group of friends with extraordinary influence. With their love and support, there was no doubt that she would carve out a dazzling future.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Aurora refused to return to Celeste, Celeste would watch from afar, silently blessing her beloved daughter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua and Bertha would pay. Every single one of their sins would haunt them until their dying breaths.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora," Celeste murmured, "you will be happy. Even if you never forgive me, even if you never call me 'Mom' again, I swear to protect you for the rest of my days. For you alone, I will live."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes gleamed with both madness and determination.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="224.html">« Prev</a><a href="226.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
