Since you're married to Madam Hawke's son, can't you get Adolph in with us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy listened to Bertha's familiar pronunciation of his name and made it clear: This girl had a crush on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy smiled and patted her hand, then turned to the security guard with a cold expression. "Beatrice is my husband's mother. Are you going to stop me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam's face instantly brightened. "Of course, I wouldn't dare stop anyone from the Hawke family. But we still need to follow protocol. As a family member, you should have an invitation, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy pulled out a golden invitation from her purse without saying anything else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While other guests received red invitations, only Hawke family members received golden ones. Sam carefully examined the invitation, his face lighting up enthusiastically. "Right this way, Mrs. Hawke!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy lifted her chin with an air of superiority. "These two are my guests. They'll be coming in with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam hesitated for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he figured since Adolph knew someone from the Hawke family, not having an invitation shouldn't be a problem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So he stepped aside and let them through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha, Judy, and Adolph entered the hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment they stepped into the ballroom, they were greeted by dazzling lights and the vibrant buzz of conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elegant crystal chandeliers glow softly, highlighting the guests' designer outfits and sparkling jewelry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph scanned the room sternly, searching for potential business connections that could benefit the Sherwood Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Spotting some familiar business partners, he grabbed a drink from a passing waiter's tray and headed straight into the crowd, leaving Bertha and Judy behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha held onto Judy's arm, her eyes searching the room for that tall, handsome, and distinguished figure she longed to see.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She frowned, feeling increasingly frustrated and disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't come to celebrate Beatrice's birthday. Her mind was wholly focused on Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the constant flow of guests filling the ballroom, she couldn't even glimpse him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She let go of Judy's arm and whispered, "Judy, I need to use the restroom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After getting Judy's approval, she quickly left the ballroom to look for Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lingered near the restroom entrance for a while, hoping to get lucky, but after ten minutes, Julian had not returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Determined not to give up, she headed toward the hotel's private suites.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Simon checked his watch in the room and said, "The party starts in five minutes. We should head down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora nodded and stood up while Simon immediately stepped forward to adjust the folds of her dress carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once everything was perfect, they gracefully exited the room one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, they ran straight into Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha's face darkened instantly at the sight of Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never expected to encounter Aurora at an event where she had eagerly hoped to meet Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked like a fairytale princess in her pink tulle gown, seeming to glow under the lights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The layered skirt of her pink dress floated like dreamy clouds around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expertly applied makeup enhanced her natural beauty to a stunning effect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her silk-like skin had a subtle blush, while her cherry-red lipstick perfectly defined her full lips, which curved into a hint of a smile that could make anyone's heart skip a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few playful strands of hair had escaped to frame her face, complementing her delicate hair accessories and highlighting her beauty even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of Aurora lit a fire of rage in Bertha's heart. She hated seeing her rival shine so brightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's face was blessed with the best features of both Joshua and Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was precisely because Aurora was so beautiful that Bertha repeatedly tried to destroy her, wishing she could mar her perfect face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was this bitch doing here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was she trying to seduce Julian?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mere possibility made Bertha hate Aurora even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora barely spared Bertha a glance, her face remaining completely expressionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today was Beatrice's birthday celebration, and she had no interest in dealing with insignificant people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clutching the gift box closer to her chest, Aurora turned to Simon and said, "Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once she saw they were alone, Bertha dropped her fake facade. Her eyes were blazing with jealousy and hatred as she glared at Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She spat out, "You dressed like a tramp just to seduce men at the party, didn't you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An ex-con like you is only good enough to be some old man's mistress!" Her shrill voice echoed through the empty hallway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora kept walking, showing no sign of being upset.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Bertha's nasty personality well, and these shameless insults had become all too familiar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During her time in prison, she had endured countless humiliations. A few crude remarks meant nothing to her now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She refused to let someone like Bertha ruin her mood on Beatrice's special day. Everything today was about Beatrice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's indifference only made Bertha angrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her mind, Aurora was supposed to cry at her insults and fight back like a madwoman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua, Celeste, and Barnett would rush to protect Bertha whenever Aurora took her bait and ganged up against her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This trick had worked like a charm every time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But today, her plan backfired. Aurora didn't break down or lose control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't even acknowledge Bertha's existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being completely ignored drove Bertha over the edge with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly lunged forward and grabbed Aurora's hair, her nails nearly digging into Aurora's scalp. "You bitch, stop acting all high and mighty!" she screamed. "I'll show you that you're nothing compared to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was caught off guard by the sudden attack. She instinctively tried to break free, but Bertha's grip was too firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon shrieked when he saw Bertha destroying the hairstyle he had created for Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get your hands off her, you crazy woman!" Simon yelled as he grabbed Bertha's hair and yanked it hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha yelped in pain and reflexively released her grip on Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man's stern voice cut through the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell is going on here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon and Aurora turned toward the voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They saw Adolph striding toward them, his face dark with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon's heart skipped a beat at Adolph's masculine presence. He quickly let go of Bertha's hair and stared at Adolph like a lovesick puppy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha immediately recognized Adolph's voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, her behavior shifted from madwoman to fragile damsel. She trembled and broke into tears as she gazed fearfully at Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha whimpered, "Aurora, I didn't mean to ruin your hairstyle. You're misunderstanding me, I swear..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Bertha sobbed dramatically, Aurora frowned, sensing trouble brewing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph's harsh voice cut through the air. "Aurora, you've gone too far."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He strode over to Bertha's side and pulled her into his arms, playing the victim as she cried breathlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While nestled in his embrace, Bertha shot Aurora a smug smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without bothering to hear both sides, Adolph coldly commanded Aurora, "Apologies to Bertha right now."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="94.html">« Prev</a><a href="96.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
