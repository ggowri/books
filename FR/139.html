He remained calm and composed, listening intently to their conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora hesitated for a moment, "I... agree."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?" Lily's face lit up with joy. She stepped forward and tightly hugged Aurora, her voice brimming with excitement. "Aurora, when should we leave?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about tomorrow? I'll book the tickets later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora couldn't see Lily's lips or hear her words, but she could tell that Lily had spoken at length.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gently pushed Lily away and continued, "I agree to leave with you, but..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But?" Lily's smile froze, and a hint of nervousness and confusion flashed in her eyes. "But what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora bit her lower lip, looking troubled. "I promised Mr. Hawke that I would finish embroidering </span><span style="font-style: italic;">The Garden</span><span> for Madam Hawke. At her birthday party, Mr. Hawke spent 20 million dollars on that piece, but I was careless, and Bertha took the chance to tear it apart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, guilt and self-reproach filled her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Moreover, Mr. Hawke has been kind to me. When I was at my lowest, he appeared and pulled me back. If it weren't for him, I would have jumped off the bridge the night Camille woke up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, she had also drunk two bottles of wine worth a million dollars, which her body couldn't metabolize, leading to her hospitalization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian had also paid for her medical expenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She kept all these things in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She owed Julian so much and had yet to repay him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily clenched her fists, never imagining that Aurora had once harbored such despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, she was immensely grateful that Aurora had met Julian, or, she would never have seen Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily cautiously asked, "Then, after you've repaid Mr. Hawke, can we go abroad?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora smiled gently, "Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that she had mastered the art of embroidery, she could support herself even abroad, ensuring she wouldn't fall into dire straits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian listened quietly, the glint in his eyes deepening, like an unfathomable lake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Aurora, I never agreed to let you escape from my side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grandma has already decided you'll be my wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've even placed my mother's ring on your finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>You're part of the Hawke family. How can you leave so easily and abandon us?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he didn't plan to stop her now. What he wanted was for Aurora to willingly return to him, even if she did try to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, Aurora woke up to the sound of light rain tapping rhythmically against the window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She followed her usual routine, washing up and then heading downstairs for breakfast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing her meal, she prepared to go upstairs to continue her unfinished embroidery work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as she turned, a warm and strong hand suddenly grasped her wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The touch sent a surge of electricity through her body, making her heart race uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes widened in surprise and confusion as she looked at the man in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's lips parted, and his deep, magnetic voice flowed through the air. "Aurora, sit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The way he said her name made her flush and heart race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't know when he had stopped calling her Ms. </span><span>Elvador</span><span>, but every time he spoke to her, he would pull her close, making her face him directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawke, is&hellip;something wrong?" Aurora's voice was soft and slightly trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Adolph's parents have brought Camille here," Julian said calmly, as if it were the most ordinary thing. But Aurora could feel the tension in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was stunned and didn't know how to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment she had been waiting for, day and night, for five years had finally arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the truth had already been uncovered by Daniel, Camille held a special significance for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Only she can prove my innocence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Camille's testimony could completely clear the five years of wrongful accusations Aurora had endured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following Julian's pull, she slowly sat down beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian turned slightly and instructed Ashley, "Ashley, open the door and let them in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wilson and Lizeth had been waiting outside for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After learning the truth from Camille, their faces had turned ashen, filled with guilt and remorse. They could hardly face Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For over an hour, while Aurora had been waking up, washing, and eating breakfast, the couple had stood outside the Hawke Estate, letting the cold rain soak them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't use umbrellas, as if punishing themselves for their past mistakes, seeking redemption through this self-inflicted suffering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rain mercilessly drenched their clothes, their hair clinging to their pale faces, making them look disheveled and pitiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley opened the villa's door and said to Wilson, Lizeth, and Camille standing outside the iron gate, "Come in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At these words, Wilson and Lizeth shuddered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, their legs felt as if they were too heavy to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just yesterday, they had been determined to teach Aurora a lesson and humiliate her. But in one day, everything changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five years ago, Aurora had never harmed Camille.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Camille's injury had become the beginning of Aurora's nightmare: five years of wrongful imprisonment and endless suffering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camille glanced at her depressed parents, and felt a wave of sorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go in. We must face what's coming. No one can escape the need for atonement. This is what we owe Aurora."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was calm and resolute as she pushed her wheelchair into the villa, her parents trailing behind like lifeless figures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they saw Aurora sitting on the sofa in the living room, it was as if an invisible force had drained all their strength. Their legs gave way, and with a thud, both of them knelt before Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, we're sorry." Wilson's voice was hoarse and trembling, filled with deep remorse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We didn't mean to. We thought you harmed Camille, so we sent you to prison. We're truly sorry." Lizeth sobbed and said, tears streaming down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a few days, they had been crushed by one harsh truth after another, as if they had aged 10 years in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They sincerely apologized, but Aurora would not easily accept this belated repentance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think a simple 'sorry' can make up for the suffering?" Aurora's voice was calm, but it carried an undeniable anger and resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In prison, I was slapped every day, forced to kneel, drank toilet water, pricked with needles, and my leg was broken..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Aurora recounted each detail, Wilson and Lizeth's faces grew paler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't this all your doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And it's not just you. Joshua, Bertha, and the others even bribed prisoners to torment me. They even took one of my kidneys."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was once a healthy person with a bright future, but now I'm disabled. Everyone is responsible for this."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's voice trembled slightly. "You've ruined my life. How can you think a simple sorry can erase the harm you've caused me?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="138.html">« Prev</a><a href="140.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
