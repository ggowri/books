You can't escape the Elvador bloodline. As an Elvador, you have duties. Don't forget the promise you made to your father and me. If you break it and leave, what you want will slip away."</span><span> </span><span>Her voice was firm and sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora wasn't surprised. She expected this from Celeste.</span><span> </span><span>When emotions failed, she turned to money threats. Even if Aurora said no, the Elvadors would use Daisy and Lily against her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her marriage to Julian wasn't really up to her. Whether she agreed or not, they would force her into it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart had been shattered long ago. After all the manipulation and pressure, there was no longer a trace of pity or shock in her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora realized that Celeste's visit to the hospital wasn't about showing concern for her. The true purpose was to pressure her into marrying Julian and securing the Elvador family's position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you done?" Aurora asked, her tone flat as she dismissed them, her voice devoid of any warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned her head away, unwilling to look at the two faces that filled her with disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's heart was aching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She longed for Aurora to crave her love, to yearn for her attention like she once did. She wished that just a single tear from Aurora would be enough to satisfy her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was nothing&mdash;no response, no tears. Nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain in her heart twisted her words. "You're fine, it seems. Get out of here as soon as possible. Your father and I will find a chance to arrange a meeting between you and Mr. Hawke." She turned abruptly, almost running out of the room in haste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett shot Aurora a long, deep look, as if he wanted to say something, but in the end, he sighed helplessly and followed Celeste out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent, the kind of silence that made Aurora's breath tremble slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hands gripped the blanket tightly, clenching it again and again, as if trying to hold back the intense pain twisting in her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She told herself she couldn't cry, couldn't show weakness. These people weren't worth </span><span>her</span><span> single tear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, her fingers loosened, and all her pent-up frustration faded with Daisy's concern. "You must be hungry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy opened the thermos, and the warm aroma of chicken soup filled the room, calming the atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora sipped the soup, and without thinking, she muttered, "I really envy Lily. She has such a good mother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy's heart ached, and her eyes instantly welled up with tears. She fought to suppress the rising emotion, her gaze filled with both sorrow and tenderness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sat down at Aurora's bedside. "Ms. Elvador, let's just leave the Elvador Villa. They've never truly cared for you. You can cut ties with them, and we can go somewhere no one can find us, where we can live peacefully."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora longed for that. She dreamed of escaping this cage of a "home".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the thought came and went in an instant, replaced by harsh reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she left, how would the Elvador family treat Daisy? What would happen to Lily's education?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaving the Elvador family was inevitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once she married Julian and received 10 million dollars, she would leave. Not just for her own sake, but for Daisy and Lily too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she couldn't tell Daisy any of this. She remained silent, keeping her thoughts to herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stared blankly, her mind elsewhere as she mechanically swallowed the soup, its taste lost on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy tried to comfort her further. "Ms. Elvador, I can see how disillusioned you are with the Elvador family. You wanted to leave the Elvador Villa the day you were released from prison, so why haven't you left yet? Have they threatened you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora bit her lip, not daring to meet Daisy's concerned eyes. She whispered, "No."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was so faint it barely carried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy wanted to press further, but seeing Aurora's unwillingness to speak, she sighed softly, helplessness and pity clouding her expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning came, and the first light of dawn filtered through the window, casting soft rays over Aurora's bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was the sleep, but her head didn't ache as much as it had the day before. Her mind felt a little clearer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She slowly got out of bed, intending to get some fresh air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she stepped into the hallway, she heard a familiar, cheery voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked up to see Bertha and Hubery walking side by side, chatting and laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha wore a white dress today, her face touched with barely-there makeup that gave her a fresh, dewy glow&mdash;almost as if she weren't wearing any at all. A thick bandage wrapped around her forehead, and she radiated a pure, innocent aura, so delicate that it stirred a strong urge to protect her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Bertha saw Aurora, her smile faltered, panic flashing in her eyes. Her body trembled slightly, and she hesitated before timidly calling out, "Aurora."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery, clearly surprised to see her in the hallway, paused for a moment. His eyes held a mix of guilt and a strangely complicated sympathy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's expression remained calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One was a hypocrite, the other heartless&mdash;what a perfect pair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her steps barely faltered as she continued walking, ignoring them completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha bit her lip, pretending to be afraid of Aurora, but still attempting to act calm. She asked softly, "Are you feeling better? Hubery and I came to see you. Where are you going?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora didn't want to respond, but Bertha kept closing the distance, obviously seeking trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stopped right in front of Bertha. Before Bertha could react, she raised her hand and slapped her hard across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The slap sent Bertha stumbling back, her delicate makeup shattered by the force, and a red mark bloomed across her smooth cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery reacted quickly, catching Bertha and steadying her. Then he pushed Aurora away with force, his face dark with anger. "Aurora, this is too much! Bertha came to the hospital to check on you, and you hit her without any explanation. What are you trying to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was loud with fury, echoing down the hallway and drawing the attention of passing nurses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora almost lost her balance from the push.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her anger flared, and she spun around, slapping Hubery across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound was sharp and resounding, so loud that even her palm stung from the impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's head snapped to the side, and his eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora shook her hand. "How dare you ask me what I'm doing? I could ask Bertha the same thing&mdash;she knows I can't stand her, yet she keeps coming around, clearly trying to make things worse. Why shouldn't I slap her? And you&mdash;you're nothing to me. What makes you think you have the right to question me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery turned and looked at her, as if seeing her for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his memory, Aurora had been a sweet, cheerful girl&mdash;always full of life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She used to trail behind him, calling his name, "Hubery", with that bright, infectious energy of hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remembered her saying, "Hubery, you're my hero. As long as you're by my side, I'm not afraid of anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, the same mouth that once said those words was calling him "nothing".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery stared at Aurora, his gaze filled with shock and unfamiliarity. "Aurora, what's happened to you? Didn't five years in prison teach you that hitting people is against the law?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed to be trying to use the law to intimidate her, but his voice quivered slightly, betraying his unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh?" Aurora raised her chin defiantly. "Then go ahead and sue me."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="54.html">« Prev</a><a href="56.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
