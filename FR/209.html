"Silly girl, no need to be so formal with Mom. This is your home now. You name it, and I'll make it happen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora turned her head and planted a sweet peck on Laura's cheek. "Mommy, you're the best."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That kiss just melted Laura's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I knew adopting a daughter was the smartest move ever!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Look at how cute and loving Aurora is, giving me kisses. Oh, it's just the best thing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but compare Aurora with William, who always looked like a stone statue.</span><br><span>She's a ray of sunshine, not like that grumpy boy of ours who's as cold as ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Laura squeezed Aurora even tighter and gave her a big smooch on the cheek, showering her with love and breathing in the wonderful baby-powder smell in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Benjamin watched this heart-warming mother-daughter scene, a twinge of jealousy creeping over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So far, Aurora had never given him a hug or a kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahem." He cleared his throat and slowly dropped to his knees in front of Aurora, his face alight with eagerness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, I picked this room for you and supervised the renovations myself," he said, practically hanging on her every word, waiting for a reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was taken aback and blinked a few times. For a moment, she wondered if she was overthinking his intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, she'd been badly burned by her so-called parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had bared her soul, but they'd treated her like dirt, with nothing but cold shoulders, snide remarks, and looks of superiority. They'd chipped away at her confidence, leaving her scared to even try and figure out what they were up to. Every time she'd tried to show them some real love, it had ended in heartbreak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, looking at Benjamin's hopeful face, she started to second-guess his intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as she stared into his eyes, a mix of wariness and longing in them, her heart softened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin and Laura were like night and day compared to her old parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt that this time, being kind wouldn't be a waste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gathering her courage, Aurora reached out her chubby little hand, cupped Benjamin's handsome face, and planted a gentle kiss on his cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, Benjamin's eyes lit up like a Christmas tree, and a beaming smile spread across his face, oozing pure joy and shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Ahh, that's why they say daughters are a father's little sweethearts. She's so thoughtful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His insides were doing somersaults with excitement, but Benjamin reined it in so as not to spook his little girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, he couldn't help himself and scooped her up, twirling her around a couple of times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura watched this unfold and playfully said, "Look at you, acting like a kid in a candy store. Don't go scaring Aurora now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she said that, there was no hiding the warm, loving smile on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William stood off to the side, eyeing this heart-warming family moment with a pang of longing and envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was dying for a hug from his sister, and a twinge of jealousy hit him as he fidgeted with the edge of his shirt. "Aurora, I picked out all the toys in your room!" he blurted out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the words left his mouth, a blush crept up his cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora poked her head out from Benjamin's arms. When she saw William looking all sheepish, she had to bite her lip to hold back a laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Oh, my little hunk. Trying to act all grown-up but still just a kid. How cute is that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was set on including her brother, so she squirmed out of Benjamin's grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he felt her gone, Benjamin's arms dropped to his sides. There was a strange emptiness, a blend of yearning and a touch of disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora walked up to William and planted a soft kiss on his cheek. With a bright and perky voice, she spoke up, "Thank you! It's so great to have a brother like you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was a pro at making everyone feel loved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to her, Benjamin, Laura, and William all broke into wider smiles, their eyes sparkling with delight at her endearing gesture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William's face turned as red as a tomato, and he stuttered, "Y-You don't have to thank me. I...I'll always have your back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching the kids getting close, Benjamin and Laura shared a knowing look and exchanged smiles. Their hearts were filled with warmth as the room was bathed in an aura of happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the butler came over, bowing slightly. "Mr. Barron, Mrs. Barron, dinner's on the table."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura took Aurora's hand, grinning from ear to ear. "Come on, Aurora! Let's dig in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they were all seated in the dining room, Aurora's eyes popped at the sumptuous feast in front of her. The table was loaded with all kinds of mouth-watering dishes that looked and smelled amazing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was so overcome with emotion that her throat tightened and tears welled up in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She silently cursed herself inside.</span><br><span>How starved for love could I possibly be to keep getting all misty-eyed because of Benjamin and Laura's love for me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it wasn't just any dinner; it was a manifestation of love. In the three years she'd spent with the Elvador family, no one had ever waited for her to have a meal with them, and she'd never tasted anything half as good as what was spread out on the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora'd subsisted on cold leftovers while the Elvador family's fridge was always stocked to the brim, and not a single crumb went to waste&mdash;because she ended up eating it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd lived a life that was even worse off than the family dog, which was fed nutritionally balanced meals, while she made do with scraps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, as Aurora stared at the lavish feast, painful memories came crashing into her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, you must be famished! Come, sit next to Mommy and have whatever you fancy," Laura said, her voice full of warmth and welcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, the family gathered around the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they started to eat, Aurora was brimming with gratitude and happiness. Benjamin, Laura, and William were buoyed by her enthusiasm, and their own appetites were whetted. Laughter and chatter filled the dining room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dinner, Laura took Aurora to the bathroom for a bath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Aurora had freshened up, she slipped into some soft and comfy pajamas. Laura gently laid her on the bed, pulled the covers up snugly around her, and started spinning bedtime stories with her soothing voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Laura's melodious voice filled the room, Aurora's eyelids began to droop, and she soon drifted off into sweet dreams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching her daughter fall asleep, Laura gave Aurora a light kiss on the forehead and then got up to turn off the light. But just as she reached the door, a pang tugged at her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura glanced back at the sleeping Aurora. After a brief inner battle, she gave in to the overwhelming urge to hold her. She returned to the bed, gently nestled beside Aurora, and embraced her. Only then did Laura close her eyes in contentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Benjamin was waiting for Laura in their bedroom. As the minutes ticked by and turned into an hour, he got fidgety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's taking her so long?" he mumbled to himself, tossing and turning in bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he decided to go and check on them. He tiptoed down the hallway towards Aurora's room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the soft moonlight, he saw his wife and daughter sleeping peacefully together, and his heart melted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin couldn't help smiling as he climbed onto the bed beside them. He stretched out his long arms and pulled both Laura and Aurora close. A deep sense of satisfaction washed over him as he finally closed his eyes, and the worries of the world faded away in the warmth of his perfect family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his bedroom, William wore a smug grin on his face, a stark contrast to his usual demeanor around others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His little fingers tapped rapidly on his phone as he uploaded a photo of Aurora to their group chat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joe Hunter said: [Whoa! What a cute little girl, William! Who's that?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver Mills chimed in: [That's gotta be a picture from the internet.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William said: [Nope, that's my sister!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joe didn't buy it: [Your sister? Come on, you can't be serious! I didn't even know you had a sister!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver replied: [Yeah, you don't even have any cousins or anything. Where did this adorable little girl pop up from? Are you secretly jealous of me having a sister?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joe said: [Man, it's pitiful! I don't have a sister either, and neither do Will or Juli. Ollie's the luckiest!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver typed: [@Julian, why don't you hop into the conversation?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian replied: [@William, is she really your sister?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William's smile deepened as he read the chat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said: [Of course! Isn't my sister the cutest, most adorable girl ever? She even hugged me and kissed me today! She's so sweet and soft.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joe butted in: [William, if you keep showing off, I might just sneak over to your place and take her!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver agreed: [Count me in too! I want to see if your sister is as cute as mine!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian said: [I'm down for that as well!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William snapped: [No way! She's all mine!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Filled with the giddy excitement of showing off his sister, William plopped his phone on the bedside table, a strange sense of fulfillment washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he lay in bed, Aurora's chubby little face kept popping into his head, and sleep seemed to be playing hard-to-get.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a short pause, he sat bolt upright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is Aurora's first night at my place. She's probably shitting bricks sleeping all by herself. What if she wakes up and gets the heebie-jeebies? I need to be there for her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trying to be the voice of reason, he climbed out of bed, snatched his pillow, and tiptoed towards Aurora's room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moonlight streamed in, bathing his small frame in a soft, silvery glow as he ghosted down the hallway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Aurora's door, William paused briefly before easing it open. The door let out a tiny creak that sounded like a thunderclap in the dead-quiet night. He froze on the spot, ears pricked up, waiting to hear if anyone inside had stirred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, in the dim light, he could make out the peaceful outlines of three figures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura had Aurora snug as a bug in her arms, with Aurora's little head nestled against Laura's chest, fast asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin had casually slung his arm over both of them, a calm smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William stood there, rooted to the spot, a pang of jealousy hitting him like a ton of bricks. He muttered, "I mean, wasn't the whole idea of getting a sister to have someone to hang with me? And here they are, having a ball without me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked around, trying to find a nook to squeeze into, but the double bed was packed to the rafters, with no room at all for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustrated, William started pacing around the bed and finally let out a defeated sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Night, sis," he murmured before dragging himself out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, Aurora roused slowly. Her eyelids fluttered open, and there was Laura's gorgeous face right in her line of sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mommy?" Aurora blurted out, blinking in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, sweetie, you're up?" Laura cooed in a warm, gentle voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora felt a bit bashful at being called "sweetie", and her cheeks turned pink. "Mommy, what are you doing in my bed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was worried you'd get the jitters at night, so I came to keep you company. How'd you sleep?" Laura asked tenderly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora beamed, remembering how peaceful and snug she'd felt all night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the plush, comfortable bed, a toasty room, and clean sheets, everything around her seemed absolutely ideal. How could she have any trouble catching some Zs?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, she'd slept like a rock, without a single dream, straight through till morning, totally oblivious to Laura's presence beside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stretched out her chubby little hands and threw them around Laura's neck. "Mommy, thanks for being so great to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura gave her a tight squeeze. "Oh, you silly thing! I'm your mom. Taking care of you is a no-brainer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Yeah!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">A mom looking after her kid is just the way it is. But Celeste, my birth mom, never get that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Celeste always says she treats Bertha and me the same, but it's always Bertha who gets the lion's share of the love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But that is history, and this is a new chapter. No point dwelling on those bad memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, time to get up and freshen up. Breakfast is on the table!" Laura said in a gentle, loving voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora nodded meekly and slid out of bed. Her tiny feet touched the soft carpet, and she slipped on her slippers, which made Laura heap praise on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought in disbelief.</span><br><span>Seriously? Just putting on my shoes is worth all this praise?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora followed Laura into the bathroom and found that her toothbrush was all set, with toothpaste already squeezed onto it and a cup of warm water waiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A warm feeling washed over her as she took in the sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She picked up the toothbrush and got cracking, brushing her teeth with gusto.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura watched her, beaming from ear to ear, barely able to contain her excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow! My little Aurora! You're only five and you already know how to brush your own teeth! You're a real little star, my sweetie!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aww, look at how well you're brushing. You're like a pro! Even better than Mommy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my goodness! Not only can my sweet girl brush your teeth, but you can wash your face too? You're a smart cookie!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora felt her cheeks go pink, drowning in a sea of compliments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her two lifetimes combined, she'd never heard so many nice things said to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they'd finished freshening up, Laura swooped Aurora up in her arms. "Sweetheart, let's go have breakfast."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mommy, I can walk by myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all that-brushing your teeth, washing your face, and getting all dolled up, you must be bushed. So let Mommy carry you downstairs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora rolled her eyes and couldn't help but let out a sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when her dear mommy kept insisting, she figured there was no use fighting it. So Aurora gave in, let herself be held in Laura's arms, and planted a big kiss on Laura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura's heart swelled with so much joy it felt like it was about to burst. Aurora's show of love made her feel like the luckiest woman on the planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they stepped into the dining room, Benjamin and William were already sitting at the table, quietly waiting for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four-member family had a peaceful breakfast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After breakfast, Benjamin left for work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, voices rang out from outside the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Will, we're here to see your sister!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William's eyes popped wide open, and he quickly grabbed Aurora's hand. "Aurora, let's go hide!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bewildered, she asked, "William, what's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William tugged her along, running in a hurry.</span><br><span>I can't let those three little troublemakers get my sweet, cute sister!</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="208.html">« Prev</a><a href="210.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
