"This is stunning! It's not just a repair&mdash;it's making it even more beautiful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shop assistants nearby also couldn't help but praise her, their admiration clear in their eyes as they gazed at Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora gave a faint, satisfied smile. "I'm glad you like it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man nodded vigorously, </span><span>full of</span><span> gratitude. "I can't thank you enough. You've done me a huge favor! I... I don't even know how to repay you. How much do you want? Just name your price."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora waved her hand. "It's nothing, really. It's just a small favor. I've been having a rough time lately, so consider it a little good deed to improve my luck."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thanking her repeatedly, the man hurriedly left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stepping out of the tailor shop, Aurora noticed that the sky had already darkened, the streetlights casting a soft glow over the pavement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hailed another cab to head to Elvador Villa, but when she arrived, she discovered that the Elvador family had already left for the auction. They hadn't even waited for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora wasn't bothered by it. Since they didn't want to wait for her, she figured she wouldn't go at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the driver pulled up in front of her. He rolled down the window, clearly irritated. "Get in. Mr. and Mrs. Elvador want me to take you to the auction."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stood still, her face expressionless as she stared at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Open the door for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver, unnerved by her unblinking gaze, felt a chill run down his spine but refused to back down. "What, don't you have hands? Can't you open the door yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora narrowed her eyes. A mere driver dared to speak to her like this? She didn't need to ask&mdash;this was clearly the Elvador family's doing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that they still hadn't figured out who had the upper hand here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't begging them anymore. Now, they needed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wanted her to marry the heir of the Hawke family for the benefit of Elvador Group, yet they couldn't even be bothered to show proper respect. They still thought she could be easily manipulated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a word, Aurora turned and headed straight into the villa, leaving the driver standing there, bewildered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver, now panicking, rushed after her into the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua had made it clear&mdash;she had to be at the auction, no exceptions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver hadn't expected that just a little pressure would make Aurora snap at him and refuse to go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dropped all pretense of authority and quickly plastered on a conciliatory smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss, what are you doing? Your parents are waiting for you at the auction. If you don't leave now, you'll miss everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora calmly sat on the sofa, pouring herself a cup of coffee and sipping it slowly. She didn't even look up at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver was growing frantic, running out of ways to plead with her. He was practically begging her now, his desperation clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Aurora glanced up, meeting his eyes. "As a driver, it's important to understand your place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Y-Yes, of course..." the driver replied, though he was clearly displeased. Still, he couldn't argue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss, I'm so sorry. Please, let's go now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora took her time finishing her coffee. By now, it was already 8:00 PM, and the auction was well underway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver, sweating profusely, realized too late how badly he had misjudged the situation. He was kicking himself for not acting sooner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until half an hour later that Aurora finally set down her cup and said, "Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver practically leaped at the opportunity, hurrying to the car, where he opened the back door for her. "Please, get in, Miss."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Aurora allow herself to enter the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the auction was already halfway through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Elvador family was seated in the VIP section.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's face darkened further as the evening wore on. "The auction has already started, and she still isn't here?" he muttered under his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste, equally anxious, asked, "Joshua, do you have Aurora's phone number? Call her and ask where she is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How would I have her number?" Joshua shot back, clearly irritated. "Don't you have it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I had it, I would have already called her," Celeste said, stomping her foot in frustration. "How could she be so careless? Didn't we tell her how important tonight's event was?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua ground his teeth in anger. "I bet she's doing this on purpose."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett, who had been silent until now, furrowed his brow as he took out his phone. Dialing, he said, "I'll check with the driver."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The call connected quickly, and Barnett growled into the phone, "Why isn't Aurora here yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We just left the house." The driver's voice came through, tinged with helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's temper flared. "What do you mean, 'just left'? Didn't I tell you the auction starts at 8? It's already 8:30! Why are you just leaving now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the driver could explain that it was all Aurora's fault, Barnett snapped, "Get her here before the auction ends!" Then he hung up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Bertha, who had been silent all this time, was fixated on the heir of the Hawke family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had only heard rumors about him&mdash;that he was unstable, ruthless, and had a notorious reputation for mistreating women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her mind, he should have looked intimidating, even menacing. But instead, he was strikingly handsome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was almost sculpted by the gods&mdash;sharp features, flawless lines, and a presence that oozed wealth and power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha's eyes remained glued to him, a strange sense of disbelief creeping over her. Could the rumors really be true?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, she found herself not wanting Aurora to marry him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora, after all, was nothing more than an unloved, lowly girl. She didn't deserve to marry into the wealthiest families in the city, and she certainly didn't deserve to have a man who was more handsome than her Adolph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially not when this man was not only good-looking but clearly had great taste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze drifted to the man's custom-tailored suit, which was flawless in both fabric and cut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what truly set it apart was the bright red flower embroidered on the chest&mdash;a masterful touch that elevated the suit far beyond "bespoke."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man with such exquisite taste couldn't possibly be as bad as the rumors made him out to be... could he?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha felt uncertain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the rumors were true, she would be more than happy to see Aurora marry him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if they were false, she couldn't let Aurora get away with this. It would be like letting her catch a huge break.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No. Bertha couldn't just sit back and let things unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a determined look, she grabbed her phone and sent a message to the driver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver, glancing at Aurora, saw that she was resting with her eyes closed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flicker of darkness passed across his eyes as he read the message.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="46.html">« Prev</a><a href="48.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
