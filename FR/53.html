It's not safe to go now. The roads will be slippery, and if your clothes get wet, it won't look very dignified, especially since this is such an important moment&mdash;meeting your grandson's future wife."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice paused, considering Ashley's point, and finally agreed. "Alright, I'll wait until the rain stops. I can't let my grandson's future wife think I'm not taking her seriously."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had waited so long for her grandson's future wife, she couldn't afford to scare her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, Ashley, can you check if we have more stem cell serum, royal jelly, or platinum collagen? If we're out, get some. My grandson's future wife is so thin; she must need a boost. These will help her health. Once the rain stops, we'll take her all the supplements. Your herbal dishes will do wonders! If we get her healthy this year, maybe next year she'll give us a healthy great-grandson. Finally, some hope for the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice grinned widely, her hands almost clapping in excitement, her smile so bright it was almost like a Cheshire cat's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley shared in her happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian was perfect in every way&mdash;except for being a little too cold and distant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't sure how rumors started, but some people said Julian was a playboy, while others whispered that he had issues with his sexual health. The latter had sent Beatrice into a panic, scheduling appointments with over ten urologists for Julian, only for Ethan to step in and stop her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan reassured her, "Mr. Hawke's very popular. Don't worry about him. His health is fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice, however, was unconvinced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think if he keeps this up, he'll never get married. Normal men have kids running around by the time they're thirty. If there's nothing wrong with him, how could he not be with women? Ethan, be honest with me. Does Julian like men?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan shuddered at the question and quickly left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley shook her head, glancing at Beatrice. It was clear that now that Beatrice knew Julian had a girlfriend, she had finally relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the Elvador Villa in Orley, Celeste suddenly remembered Aurora after a night's sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The image of Aurora collapsing yesterday, blood streaming from the back of her head, came rushing back. Her heart ached, a dull throb spreading in her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could Aurora be so stubborn? Bertha's such a sweet girl. Why can't Aurora just accept her? Seems like she's still resenting that Bertha took her place. Ugh... she's impossible to deal with."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste sighed, walking down the stairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The carpet stained with blood last night had been removed, and the living room was spotless, as if nothing had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste headed straight for the utility room, hesitating before gently knocking on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She waited for a long time with no answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, are you awake?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, no reply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gently pushed the door open, finding it wasn't locked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door creaked as it swung open, but there was no sign of Aurora inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's heart sank. Without thinking, she rushed up the stairs, pulling her skirt up as she hurried to the room they had specially arranged for Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything in the room was neatly in place. The bed hadn't been touched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's heart skipped a beat. She suddenly regretted the way she had treated Aurora yesterday&mdash;regretted losing control of her emotions, regretted not paying more attention to Aurora's injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Images of Aurora fainting, her face pale and bloodied, filled her mind, and Celeste's chest tightened with guilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frantic, she called for a servant, her voice shaking as she asked, "Where's Aurora?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The servant shook their head. "We didn't see her when we woke up this morning, Mrs. Elvador."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's world tilted. She slumped against the wall, drained of all energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett emerged from his room and was alarmed by the sight of his mother in distress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, what's wrong? Are you feeling ill?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste raised her tear-filled eyes to look at Barnett, her voice trembling. "Aurora's gone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's expression darkened. "Gone? She was here last night."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste crumpled against the wall, tears spilling uncontrollably as she shook. She covered her face with her hands, sobbing. "It's my fault. I drove her away. If something happens to her, how will I ever live with myself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett suddenly remembered the phone call Daisy had made last night. He immediately took out his phone and tried to call, but the number was blocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face hardened. "Mom, try calling Daisy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's hands trembled as she dialed, but the result was the same&mdash;blocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett took a deep breath and said, "Let's check the surveillance footage."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They rushed to the monitoring room. As they watched the footage, their expressions went from confusion to horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the video, Aurora, covered in blood, dragged herself out of the villa. Daisy, who was in her sixties, then carried her bloodied form through the heavy rain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste gasped, covering her mouth with her hands as tears streamed down her face. "Aurora, my poor Aurora..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's gaze fixed on the screen. The image felt like a blade, cutting into his heart with every frame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daisy must have taken Aurora to the hospital. Let's go to the hospital now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett sped down the road, the rain coming down in sheets, the wipers barely able to keep up with the downpour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste sat in the passenger seat, her eyes vacant as she stared out the window. Her hands clenched tightly together, nails digging into her palms as she muttered under her breath, praying that Aurora would be safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the hospital, Aurora slowly regained consciousness, her head foggy and a dull pain at the back of her skull.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain, however, was nothing compared to the ache in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hollow eyes stared at the white ceiling above, the events of last night flashing through her mind in a blur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The image of Celeste, cold and heartless, smashing the ashtray against her head, was burned into her memory. It tore at her, making it hard to breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears began to fall uncontrollably, at first a few drops, and then a flood, soaking the pillow beneath her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been born to Celeste, her own flesh and blood, yet in Bertha's presence, her life seemed to mean nothing to Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had long become used to the cold, indifferent nature of the Elvador family, but still... the pain in her chest was unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora took a deep breath, forcing down the wave of hurt and tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no reason to cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all just insignificant people who didn't deserve her tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she wiped her eyes, the door to her room opened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought it was Daisy, but when she turned around, she found herself face-to-face with Celeste, whose eyes were red from crying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Celeste's tears flowed even more freely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, you scared me half to death! Why did you leave without saying anything? The rain was so heavy last night, and it was so cold. Do you know how worried I was? If something had happened to you, how could I live with myself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rushed toward Aurora, intent on hugging her, but before she could touch her, Aurora shoved her away with all her strength.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="52.html">« Prev</a><a href="54.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
