Combined with old injuries, your body has been pushed far beyond its limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, you</span><span>'</span><span>re missing a kidney. That</span><span>'</span><span>s left you weak, and it</span><span>'</span><span>s dragging down your other organs as well," the doctor said, shaking his head.</span><br><span>Daisy spoke up, her voice tight with worry.</span><br><span>"Doctor, if we replace the missing kidney and take good care of her, can she improve?"</span><br><span>He sighed deeply. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It</span><span>'</span><span>s not that simple. Years of weakness and hidden damage have already caused permanent harm to her organs.</span><br><span>"As for her ears, if it were just a ruptured eardrum, we could fix it. But her auditory nerves are irreparably damaged. Even a cochlear implant won</span><span>'</span><span>t help. And with prolonged hearing loss, it could begin affecting her speech.</span><br><span>"Regarding her leg, even if we reset it, she</span><span>'</span><span>ll never move like a normal person. At best, she might walk without a limp, but she</span><span>'</span><span>ll never be able to move quickly."</span><br><span>The doctor continued, each word feeling like a blow to her already battered spirit.</span><br><span>Aurora understood now. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cooked meat can never be fresh again.</span><br><span>No matter how hard she tried, her broken body would never heal.</span><br><span>She couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t marry, have children, or even experience intimacy like a normal woman.</span><br><span>"Doctor, how long do I have with my body like this?"</span><br><span>The question weighed heavily on her, but she had to know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're well taken care of, maybe four or five years," he replied.</span><br><span>Four or five years?</span><br><span>That meant she might not even make it to thirty.</span><br><span>Aurora stumbled forward, her body feeling as though it carried the weight of a mountain. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each breath stabbed her chest.</span><br><span>Daisy followed closely behind, her eyes welling up with tears from heartache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Elvador, don't give up. Medical science has advanced so much. If hospitals in Orley can't help, we'll try elsewhere," Daisy pleaded.</span><br><span>Aurora kept walking, limping with each step, unresponsive.</span><br><span>Then it hit Daisy. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora could no longer hear any sound.</span><br><span>Tears spilled instantly.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">When had she lost her hearing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Daisy hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t come today, she wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t have even noticed.</span><br><span>Watching Aurora</span><span>'</span><span>s fragile, thin frame, Daisy clamped a hand over her mouth, trying to stifle her sobs. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the tears wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t stop.</span><br><span>Just yesterday, they had struck back at those who had hurt Aurora.</span><br><span>Yet now, Daisy felt no satisfaction from that revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No amount of revenge could bring the girl's health back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anger and sorrow overwhelmed Daisy, but she was powerless to help Aurora. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deep sense of helplessness filled her heart.</span><br><span>"Aurora!" A deep male voice suddenly called out.</span><br><span>Daisy quickly wiped her tears and looked up, seeing Adolph in a hospital gown, his face pale, blocking Aurora's path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph was there because the night before, after learning the full truth, he had been hit harder than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back home, he drowned himself in liquor until alcohol poisoning set in, and his parents rushed him to the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never imagined he would run into Aurora at the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reaching out, he grabbed Aurora's frail shoulders, his eyes red as he asked, "Aurora, are you here to see me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's hollow gaze slowly focused. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she recognized Adolph, unmasked disgust flashed across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't even stand the sight of you," she said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph's face turned ashen, his lips trembling.
