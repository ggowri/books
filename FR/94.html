You must be under thirty, right? It's such a shame you married so young," Bertha said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy was thrilled by Bertha's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just trying to flatter me," Judy said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not flattering you at all! I'm just stating facts," Bertha insisted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy looked at Bertha seriously and said, "Bertha, there's something I haven't told you yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is it?" Bertha had a pretty good idea of what was coming but played dumb anyway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy took a deep breath and said, "I'm forty-eight years old."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha's eyes widened at this revelation, her expression screaming, "You've got to be kidding me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, girl, stop messing with me. If you're forty-eight, then I must be fifty-eight!" Bertha exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I swear I'm not lying! I am forty-eight," Judy said earnestly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seriously?" Bertha still couldn't quite believe it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah!" Judy studied Bertha's reaction carefully and asked, "Now that you know my real age, do you still want to be best friends?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After her initial surprise, Bertha grabbed Judy's arm excitedly. "Of course I'm willing! But you have to share your beauty secrets with me. How do you look so young? If I could look as good as you at your age, I'd be over the moon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Bertha's constant flattery, Judy beamed with delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha smirked inwardly, knowing she had never failed to win over anyone she set her mind to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Making people like her was a piece of cake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She put on a regretful expression and said, "I was hoping to set you up with my brother. What a shame that's not possible now. Some lucky guy out there got to marry a stunning woman like you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy couldn't help but laugh at Bertha's adorable behavior. She gently tapped Bertha's nose and said, "Silly girl, I'm far too old to be single."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha pouted with exaggerated disappointment. "Oh, what a pity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, her eyes lit up with curiosity. "So tell me, how old is your kid? Boy or girl?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy's radiant smile froze instantly at the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kids?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her greatest regret was never giving the Hawke family an heir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hatred flashed in her eyes as she thought about the person responsible for her infertility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If her child had survived, they would be in their twenties by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was all because of that bastard from the Hawke family who caused her miscarriage and left her unable to have children.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vast Hawke fortune should have included a share for her son, but now that bastard had inherited everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face twisted with rage at these thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But hatred was all she could feel. She was powerless to do anything else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could only watch helplessly as that bastard ran the entire Hawke Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coming to Orley wasn't just about celebrating Beatrice's birthday.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her main goal was to find the little homewrecker who was trying to seduce her husband, Anderson Hawke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her blood boiled every time she remembered the photo she accidentally found on Anderson's phone that night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice had sent that photo to Anderson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She always knew Beatrice disliked her, but she never expected that the old hag would secretly try to set Anderson up with young girls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson responded to Beatrice: [That's good! If you approve, Mom, I'm okay with it.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They weren't even divorced yet, and even if her husband had another woman, she would never agree to a divorce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had schemed and plotted to get rid of the first wife to marry into this wealthy family, and no one was going to force her out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha noticed the other person's expression change and immediately realized she had said the wrong thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly shut her mouth, deciding not to ask any more questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The luxury van came to a smooth stop before the hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy and Bertha stepped out gracefully, one after the other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had expected to draw admiring stares from everyone around. Still, reality hit them hard. People barely glanced at them before returning to their business, showing no special interest in their arrival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha's smile froze momentarily, but she recovered quickly, pretending not to care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy, however, couldn't hide her displeasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in Putnam, she was the center of attention wherever she went, and thanks to her noble status and stunning beauty, she was endlessly admired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But here in Orley, that special treatment had vanished entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had no idea that Aurora's earlier entrance had been so spectacular that it had overshadowed everything else, making her and Bertha's arrival seem ordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy tried to calm herself down, thinking this was just temporary. Indeed once they entered the ballroom, these country bumpkins would fawn over her like puppies when they learned who she was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha linked arms with Judy and headed toward the hotel entrance but suddenly stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam blocked a tall man in a black suit. At the same time, Sam explained apologetically, "Mr. Sherwood, please don't put me in a tough spot. Hawke Group's policy is clear! Entry is only permitted with an invitation you don't have."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam had already been warned for letting Joshua and Celeste in without permission. If he allowed the CEO of Sherwood Group to enter now, his career at Orley would be over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph's face darkened as he spoke coldly, "Just tell me what it'll take to get inside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam smiled bitterly and replied, "Mr. Sherwood, don't force my hand. I'm just following the rules here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd dealt with people like this before. All this talk was just a roundabout way of asking for money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled out a checkbook, scribbled quickly, and tossed the check at Sam. "A million dollars. That should do it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to walk past, but Sam blocked his path again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the event about to begin, Adolph's patience was wearing thin. Through gritted teeth, he warned, "Don't push your luck."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his world, money could solve almost any problem. Yet this security guard seemed utterly unfazed by his wealth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam felt his anger rising.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't believe someone of such high status could be so dense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had made it crystal clear that entry required an invitation. Did this guy think money could buy everything?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cash was tempting, but it wasn't worth risking his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam had seen firsthand how ruthless the Hawke Group could be, and he had no doubt they'd break his hands if he took that hundred grand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam kept his face cold and his stance firm as he repeated, "I'm sorry, sir, but I cannot let you in without an invitation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph had never been treated this way, and his face darkened with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to get inside today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sherwood Group's stocks had been in free fall lately, and many business partners had terminated their contracts, so he desperately needed to network at Beatrice's birthday celebration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That would be even better if he could seal the East Suburb project deal with Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This party was crucial for his business, and he couldn't afford any mistakes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how much money he offered, Sam wouldn't budge, leaving him increasingly awkward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the tension peaked, a gentle female voice called out from behind, "Adolph?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph froze, turning around to find Bertha standing arm-in-arm with a stunningly beautiful woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bertha? What brings you here?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="93.html">« Prev</a><a href="95.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
