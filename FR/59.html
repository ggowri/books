He even exhaled through his nose with a mocking grunt, refusing to budge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's temper flared, a surge of heat rising within her. "I said move!" she shouted, her voice rising in desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised her voice a few more decibels, her tone tinged with hysteria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without thinking, she lunged forward, pushing at him. But the driver was built like a wall&mdash;tall, broad, solid. It felt like she was pushing against a boulder, utterly useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the driver's massive hand swung toward Aurora's face with terrifying speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The slap came with a loud whoosh, the sound cutting through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy, who had been trailing closely behind Aurora, gasped in shock at the sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, she rushed forward, grabbing Aurora to pull her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The slap landed, but it struck Daisy squarely on the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy's body flew backward like a fragile leaf caught in the wind, crashing to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daisy&mdash;" Aurora's eyes welled with tears, her heart breaking with sympathy as her gaze flickered to Daisy, her eyes burning with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy gritted her teeth, forcing herself to stand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shakily pointed at the driver, her voice trembling with rage. "You're just a driver for the Elvador family. How dare you lay a hand on Ms. Elvador!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver's face twisted into a mockery of a smile, contempt dripping from his every word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Elvador? Her? What a joke. There's only one Ms. Elvador in this family, and that's Bertha. Aurora? She's nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora clenched her fists, trembling with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Beatrice and Ashley, having just completed the hospitalization paperwork, entered the scene and immediately froze at the sight of the altercation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice's gaze landed on Aurora, and she blinked in surprise before her eyes widened in recognition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That girl... she looks just like my grandson's future wife?" Beatrice murmured in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley focused, and sure enough, there she was&mdash;the same girl from the photo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been bothering her ever since she first saw the picture, that nagging sense of familiarity. Now, seeing her in person, it clicked. This was the girl she had helped at Sounan Railway Station over a month ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the time, the girl had been desperate, about to be dragged away by her brother. She had even called Ashley "Mom" in a moment of panic. Ashley had acted on impulse and stepped in to help her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley turned to Beatrice. "Madam Hawke, do you remember the girl I mentioned, the one from Sounan Railway Station over a month ago?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice looked up, puzzled. "I do. Why are you bringing this up now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley pointed toward Aurora, her voice filled with excitement. "That girl... it's her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?" Beatrice's eyes widened in shock, and she almost stumbled in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never made the connection. When Ashley first told her about the girl's escape, Beatrice had assumed the family must have mistreated her to such an extent that she'd rather risk the dangers of running away than return home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Beatrice thought about it, the more her heart broke for the girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had no idea that this very girl would one day become her grandson's future wife. Beatrice's heart swelled with protective love, instantly doubling her affection for Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as they were processing this, the driver raised his fist, an animalistic rage in his eyes, ready to strike at Aurora again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice, enraged by his cruelty, stormed forward without a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She swung her cane, striking the driver with all her might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're bullying a young girl? How dare you!" Beatrice's anger had no bounds, and she whacked the driver relentlessly, landing blow after blow that left him bruised and bloodied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stood in shock, unable to process the sudden appearance of a stranger helping her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could react, the driver regained his composure. "What the fuck is wrong with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that roar, he grabbed Beatrice's cane and effortlessly yanked it from her hands. Raising it high, he aimed at Beatrice's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's heart stopped as her eyes widened in terror. Without thinking, she threw herself at Beatrice, pulling her out of the way and clinging to her tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cane slammed into Aurora's back with a sickening thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora gasped in pain, her body trembling violently from the shock, but she held on to Beatrice, desperate to protect her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weakly, she asked, "Are you okay, ma'am?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice's heart melted at the sight of this girl&mdash;her grandson's future wife&mdash;so selflessly defending her, despite the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine, but what about you, dear?" Beatrice's voice was filled with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm okay." Aurora bit back her pain, her voice faltering as she struggled to sound calm. But her face had drained of color, and her body was trembling with the lingering agony of the strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that his strike had failed to land on Beatrice, the driver grew even angrier. He lifted the cane again, intent on smashing it down on her once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley was quick on her feet. With a burst of energy, she rushed at the driver and shoved him hard, stepping between him and Beatrice. "You try anything again, and I'll make sure you regret it!" she yelled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver's eyes flared red with rage. "Who do you think you are, old woman? Stay out of it, or I'll make sure you're not walking by the end of today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Ashley could respond, the driver swung the cane once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperate to stop the madness, Daisy's eyes darted around the room, her mind frantic. Her gaze fell on a nearby potted plant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Daisy grabbed it and hurled it at the driver with all her might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pot hit the driver's head with a loud crash, the force sending him stumbling backward, dazed and disoriented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He collapsed to the ground, his head ringing from the impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panting, Daisy breathed, "Ms. Elvador, go! Hurry..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora didn't waste a moment. She rushed to push the door to the hospital room open, practically throwing herself inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy was right behind her, and Beatrice and Ashley followed closely, still unsure of what exactly had just transpired but unwilling to leave Aurora's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the room, they were hit with a horrifying sight. Bertha's hands were wrapped tightly around Camille's neck, her face ashen, her lips purple from lack of air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's heart seized. Without thinking, she charged at Bertha, grabbing a fistful of her hair and yanking hard. "Bertha, let go! Let go of her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain from the hair pull made Bertha scream, but she reluctantly released Camille's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two women started to struggle, Bertha's once-petty appearance now transformed into a vicious, wild frenzy. Her claws, sharp as daggers, dug into Aurora's arm, tearing into her skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Aurora hurt sent Beatrice into a rage. "Ashley! Hold her back!" she ordered, pointing at Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Together, Ashley and Daisy managed to restrain Bertha, pinning her down as she thrashed violently, unable to break free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora, meanwhile, ignored the pain in her arm and rushed to Camille's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Camille was unresponsive, her body limp as though life had already slipped away. Her chest wasn't rising. There was no sign of breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora felt her world crumble around her. Her breath caught in her throat as she stared at Camille's lifeless form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Camille? Camille&mdash;" Aurora cried out, shaking Camille desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She placed her trembling fingers beneath Camille's nose, hoping for some sign of life&mdash;but there was nothing. No breath. Nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's heart shattered. She felt like the ground had fallen away beneath her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Doctor!" She tried to scream, but her legs buckled under her weight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body leaned forward, her hands clutching Camille's shoulders tightly as her tears flooded down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daisy! Call the doctor! Hurry!" Aurora's voice was hoarse, barely above a whisper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy realized how dire the situation was and immediately released Bertha, her panic driving her to run toward the door of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as she reached the doorway, she was blocked by three imposing figures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man at the front stood like a dark storm, his expression cold and unreadable, an aura of frost emanating from him. His eyes, sharp and menacing, were fixed on Aurora. His voice came out through clenched teeth. "Aurora, what are you doing to Camille?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="58.html">« Prev</a><a href="60.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
