Sunlight streamed through the curtains, filling the room with a cozy warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora got herself ready and made her way downstairs, where she spotted Julian sitting on the couch, completely absorbed in his newspaper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing her footsteps, he looked up, his eyes softening as they met hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora froze, caught off guard. "Mr. Hawke? Aren't you supposed to be at work?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian looked at her intently, his tone calm yet gentle. "You're going to see Joshua and Bertha today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daniel told you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah." Julian set down his newspaper, his eyes never leaving Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora fidgeted with the hem of her shirt. "I really need to go. Some things just need closure, you know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She paused before asking, "Mr. Hawke, will it mess up your schedule if you come with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian just shook his head. "Don't worry about it. I've already passed everything off to Ethan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora nodded, falling silent for a moment. She knew that once Julian decided to accompany her, there was no changing his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel had already pulled the car up to the front. Once Julian and Aurora were in, he smoothly started the engine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora sat in the back, watching the familiar city pass by her window, a deep sense of reluctance settling in her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't the city she'd miss, but Julian and Beatrice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew once she left, she might never come back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ride passed in silence until they finally reached the remote mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mountain road was brutal&mdash;narrow, winding, and riddled with potholes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora limped painfully down the path, each step clearly a struggle. She gritted her teeth, trying hard to look unbothered, but Julian saw right through her act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian crouched down in front of her, his voice gentle and low. "Hop on. I'll carry you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No </span><span>need</span><span>." Aurora shook her head. "The trail's rough enough already. Having me on your back will just make it worse. I can manage."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian wasn't having it. "Get on. If something happens to you, I'll never forgive myself." His tone left no room for argument.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked at him, feeling </span><span>a rush of emotion</span><span> she couldn't quite name. She bit her lip, hesitated for a moment, then slowly climbed onto Julian's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian stood up smoothly, adjusting her to a more comfortable position as he secured her legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel walked ahead, scouting the path and glancing back at them every so often.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mountain trail was a mess, with jagged rocks everywhere and potholes that seemed to appear out of nowhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's steps were heavy but careful. He watched every move he made, terrified of jostling her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clinging to his back, Aurora couldn't shake the guilt building inside her. "Mr. Hawke," she whispered near his ear, "seriously, let me down. I can walk on my own."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian just shook his head. "Stay still. We're almost there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something in his voice was so final that Aurora gave up arguing. She settled against his broad back, silently taking in the warmth radiating from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian was drenched in sweat after their endless trek, his shirt sticking to him like a second skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora reached </span><span>over,</span><span> her fingers gentle as she wiped the sweat from his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling her touch, Julian broke into a smile. Suddenly, he wasn't so tired anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, they spotted a few run-down houses in the distance, looking completely out of place against the backdrop of lush green mountains and clear waters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's where Joshua and Bertha were staying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian set Aurora down, and the three of them headed toward the houses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The closer they got, the faster Aurora's heart raced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All those painful memories came rushing back like a tidal wave, and she clenched her fists without even realizing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian sensed her tension and gave her hand a reassuring squeeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel had personally escorted Joshua and Bertha here, so he knew exactly where they lived. With his guidance, Julian and Aurora entered the remote, rundown village.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The villagers looked completely down on their luck, wearing clothes that were patched over and over&mdash;filthy and falling apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment these villagers spotted Aurora, Julian, and </span><span>Daniel,</span><span> their eyes lit up with curiosity. Their stares locked onto the three of them, following their every move as they made their way through the village.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Daniel's lead, they finally arrived at Joshua's old stomping grounds&mdash;the house where he'd grown up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a run-down mud brick shack, squat and bare-bones. The walls were cracked, and the roof tiles were half-missing, like the whole thing might cave in any minute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The yard was overrun with chickens and ducks, giving off a rank stench.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd barely reached the doorway when an old man's voice came booming from inside, spewing insults.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Worthless piece of shit! Why the fuck did I even bother raising you? You ghosted me for thirty goddamn years, living the high life while pretending I didn't exist. What, afraid I'd ask for a fucking handout in my old age?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now you're all crippled up and crawling back here? Never saw a cent when you were rolling in it, but now I'm supposed to wipe your ass for the rest of my life?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just like your dead whore of a mother. I dropped two grand on that cheap bitch, and she had the balls to act too good for me, wouldn't even put out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! If I didn't need a son, I would've offed her ass years ago. Ungrateful cunt. All that shit I went through for a son, and you turn out to be a backstabbing little prick. Should've killed you both right then - you and that bitch - and let the dogs have a feast. You want food? Go eat shit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, a man was thrown out the door. He hit the ground with a heavy thud, sending dust flying everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man struggled on the ground but couldn't get up or speak. All that came from his throat were painful groans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This man was Joshua.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the proud CEO of </span><span>Elvador</span><span> Group, he now wore tattered clothes that reeked of filth. He was so skinny he barely looked human, with sunken cheeks and protruding cheekbones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His exposed skin was covered in scars&mdash;obvious signs he'd been beaten regularly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right after, a skinny old man in his seventies walked out of the house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a word, he started kicking and hitting Joshua. "</span><span>Fucking waste of space. Just die already, you piece of shit!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Uh</span><span>..." Joshua tried to speak, but his stroke had left him paralyzed. When he opened his mouth, nasty drool just dripped out. He couldn't form a single word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After kicking the young man a few times, the old man finally noticed Aurora, Julian, and Daniel arriving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recognized Daniel's face&mdash;he was the one who'd dumped Joshua and Bertha's sorry asses here. The old man went stiff as a board.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You people... what are you doing at my house?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel barely opened his mouth when some woman's blood-curdling scream ripped through the air from the pig pen.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="182.html">« Prev</a><a href="184.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
