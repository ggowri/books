Brandon </span><span>was </span><span>pinn</span><span>ing</span><span> Aurora down. The once-pristine white sheets now soaked crimson with her blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's once beautiful face was grotesquely swollen, bruised beyond recognition. Her exposed skin was covered in horrific blisters from scalding water, her body a testament to unimaginable torture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight pushed Lily over the edge, her mind consumed by a murderous rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're </span><span>gonna</span><span> die for this!" she screamed, plunging a knife into Brandon's lower back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a gut-wrenching howl, collapsing off Aurora's battered body. His limbs </span><span>convulsed,</span><span> his face contorted in pure agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily was beyond reason now. She stabbed again and again, her strikes a frenzied storm of vengeance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon had no chance to defend himself, his body quickly becoming a bloody, perforated mess. She didn't stop until he was dead, his eyes wide open in a final, eternal look of terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora, barely conscious, stared in shock at Brandon's lifeless body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No... no..." she whispered. Lily had just committed murder&mdash;a crime that would indeed send her to death row!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Throughout all her previous torment, Aurora had never shed a tear. But now, watching Lily destroy her own future in a desperate act of protection, the dam broke. Tears streamed down her face uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's promising life was now ruined! It was all because of her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily froze mid-action, then suddenly wrapped her arms around Aurora. "Don't be afraid, Aurora. I'm here to save you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sounds of fighting outside</span><span> </span><span>gradually subsided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel, Ethan, Darren, and Samuel quickly entered after hearing the commotion inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they saw Aurora's barely clothed state and Brandon's lifeless body, the four men stood motionless in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, why did you kill someone again?" Ethan's brow furrowed with deep concern. "They committed a crime. We could have called the police to handle this legally. How could you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The police?" Lily suddenly burst into a chilling laugh, her eyes blazing with a dangerous intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those animals hurt Aurora! They'd only get a few years in prison and then be released. That punishment is way too easy for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want more than just throwing them in jail. I want them dead. I want them to pay with their lives for what they did to Aurora!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words hung in the air, shocking everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's tears fell like a broken string of pearls. She stared intently at Ethan. "</span><span>You said </span><span>again, what did you mean? Who else has she killed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan</span><span>'s </span><span>heart </span><span>clenched</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>T</span><span>he woman who bullied you in prison</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>A</span><span>fter she got out</span><span>, Lily killed her</span><span>. </span><span>God, you know</span><span> how many illegal things Lily has done for you? She even broke Hubery's legs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!" Lily screamed at Ethan, her eyes practically shooting flames, filled with a clear warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel frowned and tugged at Ethan's sleeve, "Ethan, Ms. </span><span>Elvador</span><span>'</span><span>s</span><span> Mr. Hawke's</span><span> fianc&eacute;e</span><span>. </span><span>Don't push it</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Ethan saw Lily killing again for Aurora, his bottled-up anger erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>She'll</span><span> be sentenced to death</span><span>!</span><span> How am I supposed to stay </span><span>calm</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An eerie silence soon settled over the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan took a deep breath, then lunged forward, yanking the knife from Lily's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing?" Lily </span><span>exclaimed</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan gritted his teeth. "I don't want you to die. Get out of here now, and I'll clean up this mess."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the cops traced anything back, he would take the fall for Lily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's heart ached so intensely she could barely breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she coughed up a mouthful of blood, her vision blurring to darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my God, Aurora!" Lily panicked. "Hold on, I'm taking you to the hospital now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel quickly scooped Aurora into his arms. They rushed out of the bedroom and </span><span>found</span><span> Frank and Isabella had fled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Cynthia and Hubery remained sprawled on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's eyes blazed with murderous intent. She picked up a knife from the ground and raised it over the two prone figures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No&mdash;" Aurora screamed in horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was too late. The knife came down, slicing clean through Cynthia's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's body went rigid, her eyes widening in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, why would you do this?" she whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily stood covered in blood, her smile twisting into something horrifyingly unnatural.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Killing one person is the same as killing two. I might as well kill everyone who ever hurt you. Trading my life for theirs? Totally worth it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She walked up to Hubery, knife in hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery wet himself in terror, desperately shaking his head. "No, I know I was wrong! Please don't kill me, Aurora, stop her... </span><span>Ahhh</span><span>&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a horrific scream, Hubery's hand was chopped off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily then proceeded to hack at him repeatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blow after blow, she brutally dismembered Hubery, almost cutting him to pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene was so horrifying that everyone trembled in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora fainted on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily approached Ethan. "Give me the butterfly knife," she demanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're insane," he said</span><span>, eyes wide</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha!" Lily sneered. "Yeah, I'm crazy. After seeing just how cruel people can be, I lost it a long time ago. Do these monsters deserve to live? Hell no, they don't."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The law will punish them!" Ethan ground out through gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, the law will punish them. But the legal consequences could never match the harm done to Aurora. If </span><span>it</span><span> could make these bastards experience even a fraction of what Aurora suffered, I wouldn't need to </span><span>do this</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These scum</span><span>s</span><span> will just sit in prison, do some work, maybe even get time off for good behavior. </span><span>That</span><span>'</span><span>s not enough</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan roared at Lily, "You're going to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whatever. I'm not scared of death. I've got plenty of people I've killed waiting to keep me company in the afterlife. No big deal," Lily shot back, her tone icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you only care about Aurora. Have you even thought about your mom? Lily, you might not owe Aurora anything, but you'll never be able to repay your mom for all the struggles she went through to raise you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily fell silent, her gaze dimming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora will take care of my mom. Let her be the dutiful daughter for me," she said with bitter resignation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was rushed into emergency surgery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The operation was long, dragging on all day and night. When they finally wheeled her out of the operating room, she was beginning to regain consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes cracked open, her gaze landing directly on the doctor's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the doctor explained her condition, tears streamed down her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily had fought with every ounce of her being to seek revenge</span><span> for her</span><span>, but her own body was rapidly failing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The patient's in really bad shape," the doctor said quietly, a hint of helplessness in his voice. "The kidney transplant went fine, but the trauma she's suffered is severe. The wound infection has caused a bunch of complications. Her body</span><span>'</span><span>s shutting down fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've done everything we can. Now, it's all up to her own strength to pull through. You should be prepared for the worst."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="190.html">« Prev</a><a href="192.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
