She raised her cane and struck him hard. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up! If it weren't for you marrying that </span><span>good-for-nothing</span><span>, none of this would have happened today!</span><span> </span><span>Look what Judy did to Aurora, and you're still trying to play peacemaker here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson, humiliated by his mother's public blow, gritted his teeth but said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He marched toward the door of the banquet hall, trying to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the door was locked from the other side and wouldn't budge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ethan, open the door!" Anderson's voice carried a commanding tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan smiled, but his words were firm. "Mr. Anderson Hawke, if you don't want to make Mr. Hawke angry, </span><span>please</span><span> stay put."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fury surged in Anderson's chest, and he clenched his fists. "You dare defy me? Do you want me to fire you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan continued smiling, unaffected. "I believe you can, Mr. Anderson Hawke, but you might as well wait here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson's veins popped in anger, but he had no choice but to stay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guests in the hall watched in stunned silence. Ethan's disregard for even the chairman's orders left them breathless in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere was thick with tension, almost suffocating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy collapsed on the floor, her eyes vacant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, her accomplices were all bruised and battered by their husbands. None of them dare to complain about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They only hoped that when Julian returned and saw the</span><span>m that miserable</span><span>, he might show them mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian walked down the long hotel corridor, cradling Aurora in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora leaned against his broad chest, listening to his steady heartbeat. The rhythmic thump calmed her like never before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they rounded the corner, an unwelcome voice cut through the air. "Mr. Hawke, where are you going?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph stood not far away, wearing a </span><span>flattering</span><span> smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally proud, Adolph had to lower himself in front of Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beside him, Bertha stared at Julian, her gaze frozen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's eyes scanned the two, then stopped at the torn embroidery in Bertha's hands. His eyes narrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could sense Aurora's tension. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he didn't know the full story, the fragments he had pieced together made it clear that Adolph and Bertha were undoubtedly involved in whatever had happened to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stopped and, for once, his expression remained relatively calm. "Mr. Sherwood, shouldn't you be heading to the banquet hall?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph, taken aback by the sudden attention, nodded eagerly. "We'll go right away. Mr. Hawke, you're..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to get a better look at the person Julian was holding, but Aurora was so tightly wrapped in Julian's arms that Adolph couldn't see her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the delicate feet exposed under the fabric told him it was a woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha shot a hostile look at Aurora, but her expression quickly returned to one of innocent curiosity, her big, clear eyes blinking at Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Julian didn't spare her a glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without answering Adolph's question, Julian simply said, "You two go ahead. I'll be there soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph and Bertha didn't think twice. After briefly bidding Julian farewell, they hurried toward the banquet hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian watched them leave, a slight smile tugging at his lips. He spoke into his collar mic, "Ethan, let those two in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He planned to lock up everyone who had hurt Aurora and take them down one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry," he murmured, offering her reassurance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's stiff body slowly relaxed in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once back in their private room, Aurora went straight into the bathroom while Julian had his men buy clothes and medical supplies for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also ordered them to retrieve the hotel's security footage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His men worked quickly, and soon they had everything ready.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian sat</span><span> down</span><span>, watching the footage unfold, his brows furrowed in deepening anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He saw Bertha provoking Aurora, tearing at her hair. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the footage, Adolph sided with Bertha without question, even dragging Aurora into a room. He saw Bertha destroy the embroidery. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only that, he </span><span>watched as Judy and others beat Aurora. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph saw it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more </span><span>Julian </span><span>watched</span><span> the clip</span><span>, the angrier he became. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fingers tightened around his phone, </span><span>his</span><span> knuckles </span><span>whitening </span><span>when he saw the blood on Adolph's lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the bathroom door opened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian set his phone down and looked up. Aurora walked out of the bathroom in a white bathrobe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her wet hair cascaded down her shoulders, and her eyes, bright as ever, seemed even clearer. Beads of water still clung to her long lashes, glittering as they fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The soft bathrobe clung to her, revealing her slender neck and collarbones in smooth, graceful lines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her lips were slightly pink, exuding both allure and a trace of vulnerability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the sight of her lips reminded him of what Adolph had done, and it angered him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His brow furrowed, though only for a moment. He quickly masked any emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was softer, lower than usual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora hesitated, feeling nervous. She didn't dare refuse, so she quietly walked over and sat on the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian dipped a cotton swab in ointment and was about to apply it when he caught a whiff of her fragrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, his hand froze, hovering just above the swollen bone of her cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The steam from the bathroom still clung to her lashes, sparkling like tiny crystals, reflecting the light as she trembled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked up, surprised. "Mr. Hawke, what's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's going to hurt," he said, his voice hoarse. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Adam's apple bobbed "Hang in there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaned in slightly, his face close to hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cool ointment made contact with her skin, soothing the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His serious expression was mere inches from her face. Aurora could see every detail of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart raced, her breath catching in her throat. She nervously clutched the edge of her robe, staring at his strong nose, too afraid to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The faint scent of his shampoo, mixed with tobacco, hovered near her nose. His warm breath brushed against her neck. His temperature made her face flush involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed Julian noticed her discomfort. He raised an eyebrow and leaned in closer, his breath now brushing over her neck more deliberately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tickling sensation made her shiver involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian, noticing</span><span> her discomfort</span><span>, lifted his eyes to meet hers. "Does it hurt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No." Aurora quickly averted her gaze, feeling like she might suffocate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be gentler. Bear with me. It'll be over soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora waited quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the ointment was applied, Aurora thought it was over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Julian surprised her by starting to dry her hair himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the age of twenty-three, Aurora had never experienced such thorough attention and care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt that both Julian and Beatrice had been so kind to her. If she ever had the chance, she promised herself she would repay them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she knew it,</span><span> she was</span><span> already</span><span> lying in bed</span><span>. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turned out that Julian had just gently pressed her down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's eyes widened in shock. "Mr. Hawke... this isn't right, is it? I... I'm not ready..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian tucked her in, his voice cool but reassuring. "Ready for what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora froze, her face turning crimson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly turned her head away. "No... Nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian chuckled softly, "It's still early. We'll go</span><span> to the party</span><span> after you get some rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora wasn't sure what Julian intended, but given his demeanor in the banquet hall, it was clear he wouldn't let things go easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said gratefully, "Thank you, Mr. Hawke."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian placed his large hand over her eyes. "Sleep."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his calming words, Aurora slowly drifted into a peaceful sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian quietly watched her, a faint smile on his face, but it quickly disappeared as he looked at the clock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>***</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time passed slowly, and the guests in the banquet hall endured a long, tense three </span><span>hours of fear and anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere inside the hall felt as if a storm were about to break.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was terrified, speculating on how Julian would handle them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time passed, their fear slowly turned into despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They started to argue, accusations flying, as the whole room descended into chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the doors to the banquet hall creaked open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian and Aurora entered together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora wore a soft blue dress, her hair flowing gracefully, and her face had recovered somewhat from the swelling. She looked </span><span>refreshing</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's gaze swept over the crowd like a blade, finally landing on Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of how she had grabbed Aurora's hair, his voice turned cold. "Ms. Bertha Elvador, your hair is a mess."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha froze, thinking for a moment that Julian might be concerned for her. A small smile crept across her face as her cheeks flushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Julian's next words shattered her smile, freezing her in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone, shave her head."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was soft, but in the silent hall, it rang out with chilling clarity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every woman in the room gasped in horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took years to grow long, beautiful hair, and even longer to maintain it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though shaving didn't hurt, the psychological impact was profound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! Please, no!" Bertha screamed in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several bodyguards quickly stepped forward, seizing her arms and dragging her from the crowd.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="100.html">« Prev</a><a href="102.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
