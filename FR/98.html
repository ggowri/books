Acting all innocent now, but I bet you're quite the whore in bed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wealthy women behind her glared at Aurora as if she had seduced their husbands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces contorted with disgust and contempt as they hurled insults at Aurora like poison arrows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A woman in a gold evening gown sneered, her eyes bulging as she screeched, "Look at that face! She's probably slept her way through half the city. Everything about her screams cheap tramp."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was sure these people had mistaken her for someone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a deep breath and calmly explained, "I've never done anything like that. You have the wrong person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wealthy woman with big curly hair crossed her arms, her chubby cheeks quivering as she sneered, "Well, look at Little Miss Innocent here. I've seen plenty of gold diggers like you before. You're just another trashy woman who learned her tricks in the gutter, throwing yourself at any man who looks your way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another overweight socialite pushed her way forward, jabbing her stubby finger toward Aurora's face as she spat out venomously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dressed up like a peacock! I bet you bought those fancy clothes by selling yourself. You think you're hot stuff because you're young and pretty, but everyone knows you're just damaged goods."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group of ladies started physically shoving Aurora around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's slight frame couldn't withstand their assault, and she nearly lost her balance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she was about to fall, Simon quickly caught her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon glared at them.

You're nobody."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A gold-digging tramp and a sissy boy! Birds of a feather do flock together.

Since then, she'd only been between the Elvador Villa and the hospital, leaving no opportunity to seduce any man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Aurora's character well enough to believe she wouldn't try to seduce anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, he had no intention of helping her out of this mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's stubborn personality needed to be taught a lesson. It was time to break that iron will of hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Bertha showed deep concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She grabbed Judy's hand, saying, "Judy, that's my sister, Aurora. There must be some misunderstanding here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Judy learned that the woman who allegedly seduced her husband was her best friend's sister, it only added fuel to the fire, making her hate Aurora even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since she and Bertha became close friends, Bertha had frequently hinted at being bullied by her older sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy already had a terrible impression of Aurora for bullying Bertha, and now, discovering that Aurora was the woman in the photo Beatrice sent to her husband, she absolutely despises her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Simon personally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his flamboyant personality, Simon was one of Putnam's top stylists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many celebrities' most iconic looks were his creations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While booking him was nearly impossible for most people, it was a piece of cake for the Hawke family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't believe that not only was this husband-stealing tramp invited to Beatrice's birthday party, but Simon, the country's leading stylist, had also been hired to style her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Beatrice think that little of her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After twenty years of marriage to Anderson, enduring endless cold shoulders and humiliation from the Hawke family, she still couldn't win Beatrice's approval!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Beatrice must have set Anderson up with that twenty-something girl because she knew I couldn't have children. She wanted that tramp Aurora to pop out more kids for the Hawke family!" she thought angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mere thought of children made her blood boil with uncontrollable rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could have had her children if it weren't for that little bastard Julian, who deliberately pushed her down the stairs when she was pregnant. He was only five at the time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did she lose the baby, but that devil child convinced the doctors to remove her uterus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The painful memories drove her entirely over the edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No other woman would bear children for the Hawke family if she couldn't have children!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lunged forward, grabbing Aurora's hair and yanking it hard, screaming, "You think you can just bat your eyelashes and men will fall at your feet? I'll teach you a lesson about shame, you little homewrecker!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora winced in pain, trying to pry Judy's hands away. "Let go of me! I don't even know your husband!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no one listened to her protests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon tried to protect Aurora, but several wealthy women blocked his path, scratching and clawing at him until his face was covered in blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon shouted in frustration, "Don't touch her! She is Julian's woman! He'll make you pay if you hurt her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy's face twisted into an ugly sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Julian's woman?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ha!

However, Aurora could still feel the hateful stares from the crowd cutting into her like arrows, shredding what was left of her dignity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing over Aurora with a look of contempt, Judy raised her right hand high and brought it down with brutal force across Aurora's left cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The slap was so powerful it whipped Aurora's head to the side, nearly knocking her over again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her left cheek swelled immediately, marked with five bright red fingerprints.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy didn't stop there. She raised her left hand and slapped Aurora's right cheek with a crack that echoed through the hallway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With both cheeks now swollen and red, Aurora looked pitiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The relentless slaps continued until blood trickled from Aurora's mouth, her mind went blank, and her ears rang so loudly she couldn't hear anything else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon tried to rush forward to protect Aurora. Still, several wealthy women held him back, leaving his face covered in bloody scratches and his clothes torn to shreds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Throughout the ordeal, Adolph stood just ten feet away, watching everything in cold silence.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="97.html">« Prev</a><a href="99.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
