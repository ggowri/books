The only downside was that she was too short and too skinny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawke, you don't like it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian cast a sharp glance at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan quickly shut up and focused on driving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's breathing gradually steadied, though faint sobs still escaped her now and then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian sat beside her, slightly furrowing his brows, and gently patted her, trying to soothe her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she didn't seem to notice, mumbling a few words in her sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at her for a long time, and perhaps, influenced by her emotions, his mood seemed to darken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Irritated, he instinctively reached for a cigarette, bringing it to his lips. But as he was about to light it, he paused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze shifted to the fragile girl beside him. With a sigh, he put the cigarette back in the pack and turned his head toward the window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lights of Orley rapidly retreated before his eyes, like countless twinkling stars in motion.

If the Elvador family had treated her like your own, would she have been </span><span>like this</span><span>? Would she have been driven to leave the hospital in the middle of the night, alone? She's like this because of you and your damn family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yesterday, she almost jumped off the building. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't bear to think of what irrational actions she might take now, having left the hospital alone in the dead of night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett was caught off guard, stumbling back a few steps, and blood instantly poured from the corner of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes turned a furious red, and he swung his punch toward Adolph without a moment's hesitation. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think you</span><span> a</span><span>re? The Elvador family may not have treated her well, but at least she lived safely for three years under our roof!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you?

He had already decided to become a good brother, to make it up to her. But now, where had she gone?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Would it kill her to not be that stubborn? </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Why can't she be more gentle and obedient like Bertha?</span><span> Barnett thought, and his eyes reddened with self-blame and fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph's veins were visibly throbbing on his forehead. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't!" he shouted, his voice echoing through the ward, filled with raw desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He loved Aurora so much. How could he bear to let her suffer in prison?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's face was full of sarcasm. "You dare to do it but can't own up to it? What kind of man are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said I didn't!" Adolph's words were laced with anger as he lashed out with a punch at Barnett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not wanting to be outdone, Barnett delivered a powerful kick to Adolph, and the two instantly erupted into a fierce fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were bloodshot, his gaze filled with unshed tears as his hands grew more aggressive with each strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph, too, his eyes burning with anger and sorrow, fought back with equal intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neither of them showed any mercy as if they were trying to punish themselves in an attempt to release the guilt that weighed them down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frantic and desperate, Hubery rushed forward, trying to separate the two men locked in a fierce fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached out to grab Barnett's arm, but in a moment of emotional turmoil, Barnett suddenly jerked his arm away, broke free from Hubery's grip, and drove his elbow into Hubery's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery let out a muffled grunt and staggered back a few steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could steady himself, Adolph, amid the chaos, mistakenly threw another punch, landing heavily on his shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's body swayed. A flash of pain crossed his face, and a surge of fury and anxiety rose within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you all insane?</span><span>!!!</span><span>" he roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett turned and glared at him fiercely. His trembling finger pointed, and he accused, "Didn't you and Aurora grow up together? Why did you send her to prison? Why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each word felt like a dagger, piercing straight into Hubery's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face turned ashen in an instant, the unbearable past crashing over him like a relentless tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up, shut up!" he shouted as if his most painful weakness had been exposed, and in that instant, his last shred of reason shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes turned red and he threw a punch desperately, hitting Barnett hard in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That punch drained all his strength, and a fresh gush of blood spilled from Barnett's mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You fucking..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The already chaotic </span><span>ward</span><span> was now in even worse disarray. The floor was covered with debris, the IV stand had toppled over, and glass shards were scattered everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them were tangled together in the small space, their clothes all wrinkled from being pulled, their faces and bodies bruised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amid the chaos of their brawl, none of them noticed the figure standing silently at the door to the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy coldly watched the scene before her, feeling nothing but absurdity</span><span>.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her eyes, Aurora had</span><span> truly been unlucky to encounter such lunatics in her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She treated the three of them with her utmost sincerity. But they all treated her like trash, even making her spend 5 years in jail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, they never admitted their wrongdoings, only shifting the blames on others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy had already been informed by Ashley that Aurora had been found, and she came to the ward only to gather Aurora's belongings and handle her discharge procedures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she hadn't expected to witness the madness unfolding before her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning away with cold indifference, Daisy decided not to share the news with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't deserve it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When </span><span>the chaos finally ceased</span><span>, Barnett slumped into a nearby chair, his hands covering his face, his shoulders trembling with quiet sobs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph was panting heavily, leaning against the wall, his eyes hollow as he stared at the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Hubery gazed out the window, </span><span>lost in thoughts</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other side, Julian stood before the floor-to-ceiling windows of the Hawke Estate, holding a thick stack of documents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan had been incredibly efficient, managing to dig through every detail of Aurora's life from childhood to the present in just one night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After </span><span>he read</span><span> through the files, Julian's expression grew heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The contents of the file were nothing short of heartbreaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At just twenty-three years old, Aurora had spent almost every day of her life in misery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had spent her childhood in an orphanage, never experiencing </span><span>family love</span><span>.
