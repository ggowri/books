Laura sneered, her voice dripping with disdain. "You let her end up in an orphanage. What right do you have to call Aurora your daughter?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's fists clenched, her voice shaky but firm. "I'm her real mom. Blood ties can't be broken."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora felt sick. Celeste talked about making things right, but did she forget the pain she caused before? Didn't she remember how much Aurora hated the Elvador family?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she truly wanted to make amends, she should've stayed far away, like she was gone for good.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste looked at Aurora with what seemed like real warmth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora," she </span><span>pleaded</span><span>, "I'm your birth mother. Come home with </span><span>me</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Aurora's face stayed ice-cold, saving her warmth for the Barrons.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a tone sharper than frost, she replied, "This is my home."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rejection pierced through Celeste like shards of glass.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart clenched painfully as she scrambled to explain herself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, you have to believe that </span><span>I </span><span>love you. You're the child I carried for nine months. How could I ever abandon you to an orphanage? It wasn't me; it was your father, that despicable man who left you there. I didn't know anything about it!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that I've finally found you, won't you come back with me? Please?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you love pretty dresses? I will buy you as many as you want. Anything at all. You name it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, Aurora scoffed silently. </span><br><span>Dresses? I don't care about dresses. Not really.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She treasured everything the Barrons gave her</span><span>, </span><span>even if it was just a leaf or a pebble.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her, anything from them was priceless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Celeste? Even if she brought down the moon from the sky, Aurora wouldn't spare it a second glance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, Aurora nestled deeper into Laura's arms.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mommy, I'm so tired."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura stroked her hair soothingly, her eyes brimming with affection.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then sleep, sweetheart. Today must've been exhausting with all those reporters around."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, she scooped up Aurora and headed upstairs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Celeste lunged forward, panic overtaking her features.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are you taking my daughter? Give her back to me right now!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin stepped in swiftly. "You're not welcome here. Leave."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leave?" Celeste spat incredulously. "Why should I leave? If you wanted a daughter so badly, why didn't you have one yourselves instead of stealing mine? How dare you!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustration was etched across Benjamin's face. He had zero tolerance for further theatrics from this lunatic.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Guards!" he barked sharply. "Escort this woman off the premises. Now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two big guys in black showed up in seconds, one on each side of Celeste.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could protest, they dragged her out forcefully, tossing her onto the driveway outside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pounded on the door, screaming at the top of her lungs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, n</span><span>o one came.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As dusk settled into night, her cries eventually faded into weary silence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Defeated, she stared longingly at Barron Estate before reluctantly walking away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a rundown rental apartment, Celeste arrived home only to hear Joshua's angry shouts echoing from inside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barnett! What kind of nonsense is this? While your mother and I were locked up these past few days, you let your sister live in this dump?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice dripped with disdain. "You're a boy, so you can rough it out. But your sister grew up surrounded by luxury! How could you subject her to such hardship?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're doing this on purpose, aren</span><span>'</span><span>t you? Just like your mother. Both of you&mdash;nothing but thorns in my side. Just being around you pisses me off."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's veins throbbed visibly beneath her skin.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was how Joshua treated her children when she wasn't around.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span> If he was this awful to his own son, what did he do to Aurora before?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thunderous kick, the door flew open, startling everyone inside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua spun around, fury blazing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell is wrong with you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's glare was murderous.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a word, she grabbed a broom leaning against the wall and began beating him mercilessly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blow after blow landed, driving him to cower and retreat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You crazy bitch! Stop it!" he yelled, shielding his head desperately.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Celeste showed no mercy. Each strike fueled her rage until Joshua was battered and bruised beyond recognition.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the corner, Bertha huddled silently, terrified.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though still a child in years, Bertha wasn't naive.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew her mother, the woman who had once </span><span>showered</span><span> her </span><span>with </span><span>love, had </span><span>turned </span><span>into a stranger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It started at the birthday gala of Aurora. Ever since, her mother's gaze had morphed into a look of pure hatred, as if Bertha had become a festering eyesore.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett stood frozen, watching his father get pummeled without uttering a word.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, when exhaustion overtook her, Celeste stopped.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pointing accusingly at Joshua, she roared, "What gives you the right to lecture my son, you bastard?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua clenched his teeth, still defiant. "I scolded him for his good! And you attack me over something so trivial? Celeste, when did you become such an unreasonable shrew?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her laughter erupted, wild and bitter, tears streaming down her face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unreasonable? Shrew?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You complain that Bertha is too delicate to endure hardship, but apparently, my biological son deserves suffering, and my daughter, abandoned in an orphanage, deserved even worse. Is that it?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's heart skipped a beat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Celeste has found out? Impossible. Don't be ridiculous. There's no way she could've pieced it together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What nonsense are you spouting? I don't understand a word," he stammered nervously.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste slapped him hard across the face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You killed my father, dumped my newborn daughter in an orphanage, and handed me that bastard child Bertha to raise. You heartless monster."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shock widened Joshua's eyes as he stared at Celeste.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">She really does know. How?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well?" Celeste snarled, tears carving tracks down her cheeks. "Got nothing to say now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught red-handed, Joshua abandoned all pretense.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smirked bitterly, "So what if I did? Your father forced me to marry into his family, and he always looked down on me. That old fool deserved to die.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once he was gone, dealing with you was easy. You dumbass!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I never expected you'd find out so soon. Tell me how?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You vile creature! I'll kill you!" </span><br><span>Enraged, Celeste lunged again, swinging the broom wildly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overwhelmed, Joshua fled, dragging Bertha along behind him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste lunged forward, her legs pumping desperately as she chased after him, but the distance between them grew.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The broom slipped from her fingers, clattering to the ground.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Breathless and defeated, she collapsed to her knees.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wrapping her arms around herself, she wept uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice broke, raw with longing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, my daughter, when will you return to me? </span><span>I </span><span>miss you so much. I want to make up for everything I've done wrong."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Memories flooded her mind, the reporters crowding around Aurora at Barron Estate earlier that day.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This version of Aurora seemed even more extraordinary than the last.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their previous life, Aurora had been the top scorer on the SAT at eighteen.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in this timeline, at merely five years old, she was already a university student, captivating journalists with her brilliance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a remarkable child was her daughter. But she lost her dear daughter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is fate mocking me, giving me a second chance only to rip it all away again?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing by the doorway, Barnett watched his mother sobbing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His chest tightened with pain, every sob slicing through him like a knife.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="221.html">« Prev</a><a href="223.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
