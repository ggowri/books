Of all the times for William's sister to get kidnapped, it had to be right when she was about to seal the deal on a major contract.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her nerves were frayed, her patience stretched thin. She was itching to get the signatures on the dotted line and be done with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't dare push. She knew all too well the weight Aurora carried in the Barron family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin and William, though reassured that Aurora was safe, couldn't shake their unease. They paced the office restlessly, their footsteps echoing their anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what felt like an eternity, though it was only half an hour, the office door swung open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian strode in, Aurora at his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Aurora appeared, Rebecca's assistant, Yana Webster, froze</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>H</span><span>er eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You?" </span><span>she</span><span> gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca frowned, puzzled. "What's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yana's jaw clenched, her voice dripping with venom. "Ms. Hansen, she's</span><span> the one</span><span> who's been throwing herself at Mr. William Barron."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Her?" Rebecca's eyes raked over Aurora, jealousy hitting her like a punch to the gut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had everything&mdash;the face, the body, and this infuriating natural elegance that Rebecca could never pull off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Benjamin or William could get a word in, Rebecca's temper flared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sneered, her tone cutting, "This is the president's office, not some back alley for just anyone to waltz into."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You," she jabbed a finger at Aurora, "with your cheap tricks and shameless flirting, don't belong here. Get out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca stood tall as if she owned the place. But as the words left her mouth, Benjamin and William's expressions darkened, their eyes glinting with disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's face remained impassive, betraying nothing.</span><span> </span><span>She stepped forward deliberately, each movement calm and measured until she stood inches from Rebecca.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a word, she slapped Rebecca</span><span> hard across the </span><span>face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>sound</span><span> echoed in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca stumbled, nearly collapsing from the force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yana, seeing her boss struck, lunged forward in a fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who do you think you are, laying a hand on Ms. Hansen? You're done for, you little..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She </span><span>tried</span><span> to strike Aurora, but before Aurora could even react, William had had enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift, furious kick, he sent Yana sprawling to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And who do you think you are," he roared, "daring to threaten my sister?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell deathly silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca and Yana stared at Aurora, their faces pale with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca's voice trembled as she stammered, "Will, you... You said she's your sister? She's... Aurora?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William's expression was ice-cold. "Who else would she be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca swayed, taking a shaky step back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No... that's impossible. How could this </span><span>be</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She whirled on Yana, her voice rising to a shriek. "You told me she was just some gold-digger trying to seduce Will!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yana was </span><span>stunned</span><span>, her face drained of color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora, the Barron family's mysterious daughter, dipped into the academic world after college and barely came home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yana had no clue she was looking right at Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her knees buckled as she </span><span>apologized to</span><span> Aurora, her eyes wide with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm so sorry, Ms. Barron. I didn't know it was you. Please, forgive me. I didn't mean it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora let out a cold, humorless laugh. "Oh, so you don't know who I am, and that makes it cool to treat me like trash?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yana shook her head frantically. "No, Ms. Barron, please, let me explain..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Explain what?" Aurora cut her off, her voice sharp as a blade. "How did you and your boss hire thugs to kidnap me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William's head snapped toward Rebecca, his eyes blazing with murderous intent. "So, you're the one behind my sister's kidnapping?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seized Rebecca by the throat, his grip unrelenting. "You dared to have my sister taken? You must have a death wish."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca gasped, her face turning crimson as she clawed at his hand, struggling to breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stepped forward quickly. "Will, stop! Don't kill her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William released Rebecca with a sneer, his voice low and dangerous. "Speak. Why did you do it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca collapsed, gasping for air, her voice choked with regret. "Will, it was a mistake, I swear. I thought she was trying to steal you from me. I got jealous and did something stupid. If I'd known she was your sister, I never would've touched her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin snorted, his tone dripping with disdain, "You didn't even bother to find out who she was before hiring criminals to kidnap her? Someone like you has no business representing my company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to William, his voice firm. "William, I won't allow a woman like </span><span>her</span><span> to become your wife."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William had never been particularly fond of Rebecca.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His sister was extraordinary, a shining star in their family. As her older brother, William's priority had always been protecting Aurora, ensuring she never felt slighted. His focus had been on his career, leaving little room for romance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rumors about him and Rebecca? Mostly her doing, clinging to him at every opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd played the part of the sweet, understanding partner so well that he'd considered giving her a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this? Orchestrating a kidnapping before they'd even started dating? It was out of line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Aurora hadn't been sharp enough to escape...</span><br><span>He shuddered to think what might have happened to his brilliant sister at the hands of those thugs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Dad," William said, his voice steady. "She's beneath my notice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca dissolved into tears, sobbing hysterically. "Will, I'm so sorry. It wasn't on purpose, I swear!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shoved her away without a second glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperate, Rebecca turned to Aurora, pleading. "Aurora, please..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she'd chosen the wrong person to beg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was no ordinary woman. Reborn after a lifetime of betrayal and suffering, she'd vowed never to let anyone walk over her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forgiveness? Not for those who'd wronged her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She believed in accountability. Adults made choices, and choices had consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Call the police," Aurora said calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" Rebecca's cry was raw, desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no one in the room spared her a shred of sympathy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Rebecca and Yana were hauled away in handcuffs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The endorsement deal for the holographic headset was dead in the water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, are you okay?" Benjamin and William asked, their voices thick with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora flashed a warm, reassuring smile. "Dad, Will, I'm fine. Really."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank God," Benjamin sighed, relief washing over him. "You had us scared out of our minds."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded, his expression softening. "We owe Julian big time. If anything had happened to you, I wouldn't know how to go on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin's fondness for Julian grew by the minute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian might come off as aloof, but he was fiercely capable when it came to handling threats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin watched him grow up from a kid, trusting him completely with his precious daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They settled into a cozy moment, chatting warmly in the office. </span><span>Then t</span><span>he</span><span>ir</span><span> conversation turned to the holographic headset endorsement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William's eyes lit up. "Why not have Aurora take the role? There's no one in the world better suited for it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin nodded enthusiastically. "What do you say, Aurora? Are you up for it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora considered for a moment, then smiled, "Sure, why not?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And just like that, the decision was made.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora became the face of the holographic headset. When the product launched, her star soared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the public learned she was the mastermind behind the holographic technology, national pride swelled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Online, people scrambled to uncover every detail about her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And w</span><span>hat they found left them </span><span>totally </span><span>astonished.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="240.html">« Prev</a><a href="242.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
