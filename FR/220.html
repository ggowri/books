But if you resist, you'll lose your life."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy thrashed wildly. "Call the police! We need to call the police!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're adults! How can we be afraid of a ten-year-old? He doesn't even have the knife now&mdash;we can </span><span>take him down</span><span>!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>And then, have him locked up</span><span> </span><span>in </span><span>a </span><span>psych ward</span><span> for life!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson hesitated.

The whole house is filled with it. If I spark this, what do you think will happen?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson and Judy's faces went slack with horror.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you insane?!" Judy shrieked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson nearly wet himself. "Julian, don't be rash! I'll do it right now!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A gas explosion would level the entire villa&mdash;none of them would survive.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why did I have to father this demon? He's worse than the devil himself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sometimes, he wondered if Julian was a sociopath.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To save his skin, Anderson pinned Judy down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Judy, don't blame me. You brought this on yourself. Why did you have to provoke Aurora? Megan crossed the Barrons&mdash;her family will be ruined soon enough.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you? You'</span><span>re about to pay for it</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! No!" Judy fought like a wild animal, but she was no match for Anderson.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sickening slice, her tongue hit the floor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She howled, blood pooling around her like a dark river.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian smiled in satisfaction.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anderson, you're still as cowardly and stupid as ever. You believed I'd turned on the gas?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think I'd throw away my life&mdash;and Aurora's future&mdash;just to take you two out?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson's eyes widened in dawning terror. "Wh-what do you mean?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I mean, there was never any gas leak. But you just mutilated Judy&mdash;and that's a felony. Congratulations, </span><span>Dad</span><span>. You're going to prison"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's grin was more terrifying than any nightmare.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="219.html">« Prev</a><a href="221.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
