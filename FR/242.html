Her life read like something out of a fairy tale, touched by magic.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[For eight years, she immersed herself in the Institute's cutting-edge work. Now, at just seventeen, while others her age were navigating high school dramas, she stood as the world's youngest scientist, the mastermind behind the planet's first holographic technology.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[That one breakthrough alone catapulted our country's technology a full century ahead of the rest of the world.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[A century? Some argued even two hundred years wouldn't be enough for others to catch up.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Online, everyone worshipped Aurora&mdash;she was the internet's golden girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then came the bombshell. Someone dug up the story of the kidnapping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Good grief, has Rebecca lost her mind? Kidnapping a scientist?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Isn't she dating William? Why would she target his sister?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Word is, she mistook Aurora for a rival and had her abducted. Turns out, she got it all wrong. Aurora is his sister.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Rebecca's got some nerve, acting without even checking the facts.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[It was just a misunderstanding. If the Barron family lets it slide, she'll probably walk.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Aurora's a scientist, not some random heiress. This isn't just about the Barrons letting it go.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, though Aurora emerged unscathed, Rebecca, Yana, and the hired goons were slapped with ten-year sentences. It was harsh but fitting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora, however, paid no mind to the chatter swirling around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her return from the Institute was merely a brief respite, a month-long breather before she'd dive back into her work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During that time, she soaked up every moment with her family and friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dora, her best friend, slung an arm around Aurora's neck, her voice tinged with reluctance. "Aurora, you're finally home, and you're only staying a month? That's way too short. Can't you stretch it out a bit?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora gave a rueful smile. "I've got a ton on my plate back at the Institute."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dora sighed dramatically, "Fine, work comes first, I get it. But..." She wiggled her eyebrows, a mischievous glint in her eye. "What about you and Juli? Isn't it time you two sealed the deal this month?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joe chimed in, grinning, "Aurora, how about giving me a shot? We grew up together, you know. You can't just fall for that ice-cold man, can you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver wasn't about to be outdone. "Hey, Aurora, I'm in the running too, you know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Aurora could respond, Julian's arm snaked around her, pulling her close with a possessive edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't know why, but despite their limited time together, he felt an unshakable claim over Aurora, a need to keep her near.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora's mine," he declared, his gaze locking onto hers with quiet intensity. "Aurora, let's get engaged."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An engagement, he figured, would fend off any rivals circling his girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's cheeks flushed a soft pink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, she'd loved Julian from afar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But back then, crippled and deaf, she'd felt unworthy of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with Beatrice's relentless matchmaking, she'd kept her distance, too afraid to dream of being with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this life was different. She was whole, healthy, and surrounded by love instead of betrayal. Gone was the timid, broken Aurora of her past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, she was the cherished daughter of the Barron family, radiant and unstoppable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was worthy of Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meeting his gaze, she said softly, "Juli, crazy thing is, I wanted to be your wife in my past life too. Would you </span><span>believe</span><span> that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dora burst out laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, you've been crushing on Juli's good looks for ages, haven't you? Spinning tales about wanting to marry him in a past life? Girl, you're smoother than I thought!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora sighed, a wry smile tugging at her lips. She was telling the truth, but no one took her seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I </span><span>do</span><span>," Julian said, his voice steady and sure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joe and Oliver exchanged awkward glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They felt Julian must have been head over heels for </span><span>Aurora</span><span>. He even b</span><span>ought</span><span> her playful little fibs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now they knew why Aurora was so smitten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To everyone, they're perfect for each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if Aurora didn't pick us," Joe said with a grin, "we'll still root for her and you to grow old together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laughter filled the air, the mood light and warm as they clinked glasses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora sipped her drink, savoring the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, the only time she'd touched alcohol was the night she nearly threw herself off a bridge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd downed two bottles of Julian's million-dollar red wine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, she'd nearly died from it. With one kidney already gone, she had barely survived the drunk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, her body was strong, and her kidneys were intact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was vibrant, alive, a woman who could laugh and banter with friends without fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raising her glass, she drained it in one go, a spark of satisfaction in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian watched her, </span><span>all</span><span> soft </span><span>and</span><span> affectionate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached out, brushing his fingers against her round, rosy cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, I don't know why, but the way you drink... it </span><span>just </span><span>feels so familiar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>L</span><span>ike I'd seen </span><span>it</span><span> before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora set her glass down and flung her arms around his neck, pulling herself close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her breath was warm against his skin, teasing and intimate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes sparkled, her cheeks flushed, and she looked utterly enchanting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawke, what if your feeling is right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian blinked, momentarily distracted by her nearness, her words barely registering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, what do you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She giggled, her voice playful. "Mr. Hawke, you're so handsome."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could make a move, she got bold with it&mdash;pushed up on him out of nowhere, had him pinned down. Everybody in the room was straight shook.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William, Joe, Oliver, and Dora gaped, their jaws practically on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What just happened?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">One minute they're joking around, and now they're... What?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora cupped Julian's face, her soft curves pressed against him, radiating confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawke," she murmured, her smile mischievous, "you're so sweet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four onlookers could hardly believe their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora, usually so gentle and refined, was now a force of nature, teasing Julian like a seasoned flirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her bold move left Julian reeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't expect her to </span><span>do this</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body screamed to hug her longer, but his mind held him back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was twenty-two, a grown man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora, though brilliant and mature, was only seventeen. She was still so young.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gently, he pulled her into his arms, his voice low and soothing. "Easy, now. Be good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora nestled against him, pliant and content, her arms wrapped tightly around his waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a soft smile, she drifted off to sleep in his embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group couldn't help but chuckle at her blissful expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dora turned to William, grinning. "Will, you'd better talk to </span><span>your parents</span><span> about Aurora and Juli's engagement. It's </span><span>really </span><span>time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William reached out, gently stroking Aurora's hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whatever Aurora wants, we will make it happen." He looked at Julian, his tone serious but warm. "Juli, we grew up together. I trust you. You'll take care of her, won't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian nodded, his eyes steady. "Always."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="241.html">« Prev</a><a href="243.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
