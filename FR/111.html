Aurora suddenly called out to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian turned back. The shadows from the hallway cut across half of his face, and his collarbone peeked faintly from his open collar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air, filled with a faint fragrance, seemed to freeze. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked at him, finding Julian both elegant and mesmerizing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of hesitation, she asked, "Why are you so nice to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This question had lingered in her </span><span>mind</span><span> </span><span>for a long time, and now she finally couldn't hold it back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian was momentarily stunned, then smiled faintly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked back to the bed and sat down beside Aurora. </span><span>And she couldn&rsquo;t help but</span><span> hold her breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said something in a language Aurora couldn't understand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was like the deep resonance of a cello.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora watched Julian's lips, which glistened with a rose-colored sheen in the warm light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt a pang of bitterness because she hadn't understood what he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet she forced herself to smile, not wanting to reveal her confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian didn't miss the fleeting stiffness in her expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gazed at the shadows cast by her trembling lashes and chuckled softly, "Will you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora could read what he said this time. He was asking if she was willing</span><span> for it</span><span>. But what he had said before, she had no idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora felt she needed to practice her lip-reading skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Julian hadn't noticed her hearing loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had already caused Julian and Beatrice too much trouble, and she didn't want to worry them further with her deafness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Aurora didn't know what Julian had said, she trusted that he would never harm her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She immediately smiled and said, "I do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the floor-to-ceiling window, thunder suddenly roared, and lightning briefly outlined the surging emotions in Julian's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Julian had just said was, "I want to marry you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether Aurora understood him or not, she had already said yes. That meant his proposal was a success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This realization put Julian in an excellent mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned off the light for Aurora, and the room was instantly plunged into darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked downstairs with steady steps. As soon as he entered the living room, three pairs of eyes stared straight at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice smiled, revealing a row of teeth, "Julian, is Aurora alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's asleep."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did the two of you do in the room?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian replied with unusual calm, "Nothing much. I proposed to her, and she agreed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You proposed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice's eyes widened, and her mouth dropped open in surprise. The good news had come so suddenly that she couldn't process it immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did you propose?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just asked her if she would marry me, and she said yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley and Daisy, hearing this, were also in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">This proposal is way too casual, isn't it? No flowers. No ring. Just his words and it's done?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy felt deeply sad and sympathetic towards Aurora. She knew Aurora had suffered too much, and she longed to be loved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's why Aurora had agreed to such a simple proposal without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, she was happy for Aurora, after all, Aurora had finally found her own happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice, however, didn't see it that way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was the fianc&eacute;e she had chosen for Julian. </span><span>So, Julian should&rsquo;ve been more serious when it came to the proposal</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian elegantly sat on the sofa, his voice low and magnetic. "It's getting late. You should all go to sleep."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, you too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice, Ashley, and Daisy each returned to their rooms. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Julian remained in the living room, accompanied by the occasional sound of Barnett's curses and the thunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's voice was already hoarse, but he showed no signs of stopping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren frowned and advised, "Stop shouting. It's useless. Let's go back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Barnett paid no attention, his eyes fixed intently on Aurora's room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora wasn't truly asleep. She sensed something was off with Julian's behavior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then </span><span>Aurora got out of bed and walked to the window, pulling the curtain slightly open to see Barnett and Darren outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett was jumping around like a madman, filled with rage and insanity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora watched him coldly, her gaze as frosty as ice on a winter night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Barnett had only one purpose for being here, and that was for Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He must be so angry because he's worried about Bertha suffering in jail," Aurora sneered. Her smile was as cold and desolate as the moon in the night sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden downpour turned the iron street lamps in the courtyard into blurry halos in the rain, and Barnett's distorted face flickered in the lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Julian stepped into the rain, the water streamed down the muscles of his back under his black shirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Barnett saw Julian, it was like seeing an enemy. He roared, "You scoundrel! How dare you show up? Hand over Aurora to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He charged like a raging bull, throwing a punch at Julian without a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian raised his arm to block, revealing the bulging veins on his forearm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, </span><span>Aurora nervously gripped the edge of the curtain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a graceful spin, Julian delivered a flying kick that sent Barnett sprawling to the </span><span>ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked coldly at Barnett, "You're not worthy to be Aurora's brother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett, grimacing in pain, got up from the ground, his expression twisted, "Not worthy? And you are? You knew Aurora wasn't in good health, yet you still slept with her. You don't care about her well-being at all. You're just as heartless as the rumors say."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rain streamed down Julian's stern face, accentuating his resolute features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And who is responsible for Aurora's deafness, her broken leg, and her kidney being taken?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Julian turned and walked into the villa, leaving Barnett collapsed on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett looked in disbelief at the direction Julian had disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what do you mean?" </span><span>Hi</span><span>s </span><span>voice trembled, his eyes filled with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett </span><span>kept shaking off the thoughts that Julian was telling the truth</span><span>, but Julian's cold eyes and harsh words hit him like a sledgehammer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Aurora's ears are damaged too? No wonder. No matter how much I shouted, she didn't react. So, she couldn't hear me at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett was heartbroken, tears mixing with the rain as they fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He staggered to his feet, and when Darren tried to help him, he pushed him away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a face as pale as paper, he looked up at the second floor, his lips trembling as he shouted, "Aurora, I'm sorry. I really didn't expect things to turn out this way. I'm so sorry."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="110.html">« Prev</a><a href="112.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
