Cynthia launched into a tirade, cursing nonstop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stayed silent, watching without a hint of emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia ranted for over ten minutes until her throat went dry, and she finally stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora</span><span> sneered</span><span>. "Done cursing? Good. Now it's my turn. Cynthia, </span><span>remember </span><span>what happened to you just six months ago</span><span>?</span><span> Guess what Julian would do if he knew how you're treating me right now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia's entire face twisted like a demon's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lunged closer to Aurora, her eyes wild with hatred. </span><span>"You witch! You and Lily wrecked everything I had! I've got nothing left to lose. Even if it kills me, I'll take you down with me! I can't wait to see Julian's face when he finds your body. Bet he'll be totally stunned in that moment of grief!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora narrowed her eyes. "I'm on my way out anyway. But you've got decades ahead. If my life can take yours down with it, sounds like a fair trade to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia was livid at Aurora's words. She lost it, pounding on the iron cage like a madwoman. "You bitch! I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora sat calmly inside the cage, watching Cynthia's meltdown with cool detachment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her, death felt like a welcome escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her revenge was complete, and this broken-down body had long since lost value to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Cynthia grabbed a fruit knife from the table, lunging toward Aurora with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery, who </span><span>was</span><span> watch</span><span>ing</span><span> </span><span>at the side</span><span>, finally intervened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cynthia, have you lost your mind? Don't forget what you told me when we first partnered up! I get Aurora, and you go after Julian. Now that Aurora is mine, shouldn't you be pursuing Julian?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia stared at Hubery as if he'd spouted complete nonsense, her look conveying pure contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hubery, did you really fall for what I said? I was just playing along to get info from you. How else would I have found out that her kidney was in Bertha's body? Or that she left Bertha in the mountains to suffer?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"See? I tracked her down, waiting for the perfect moment to snatch her when she was weakest after getting her kidney back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's face went pale. "You used me?" he asked, struggling to </span><span>catch on</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia</span><span> </span><span>sneered, "Didn't you use Aurora the same way back in college? When it comes to manipulation, you're the real pro. Love? The only person you love is yourself. Men are nothing but trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery trembled with rage at Cynthia's words. He raised his hand, ready to strike her with a vicious slap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Cynthia dodged swiftly, and instead, she swung back and landed a brutal slap on Hubery's cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strike was so forceful that it threw his head to the side, ringing his ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaking her hand, Cynthia warned, "Don't push your luck, Hubery. Remember, we're in this together. Helping Aurora won't earn you any gratitude from her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery turned his gaze toward Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment their eyes </span><span>met,</span><span> his heart clenched as if gripped by an invisible hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waves of regret and deep emotion flooded his eyes. "Aurora," he pleaded, his voice soft and desperate, "I did this because I love you. I just wanted to be with you. </span><span>D</span><span>on't </span><span>blame</span><span> me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I promise, if you stay with me, I'll never hurt you again." He sounded like a chastened child begging for forgiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora let out a sharp, bitter laugh. "What a pathetic act!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her attitude pushed Hubery over the edge. He wheeled himself in front of the cage, jaw clenched with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, what the hell do you want? Look at me&mdash;I ended up like this because of you! Don't think I don't know the truth. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have had my legs broken! It had to be Julian, that bastard&mdash;he's the one who did this to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice rose, a mix of anger and pain. "I lost my legs because of you, and I never once hated you for it! But you? You did five years in prison. Big deal! You still came out in one piece, didn't you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not missing an arm or a leg&mdash;how is your suffering worse than mine? Even if I misunderstood you and accidentally got you locked up, losing my legs should've been enough to make up for it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bitterness seeped into his tone as he continued, "We were so close back at the orphanage. You used to be so kind, so pure. But now? Now you're just petty and unforgiving. Do you even realize how insufferable you've become?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery let out all the resentment he had been holding in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's smile grew colder and more brittle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> this was indeed how Hubery felt deep down. She had known that Hubery would never change his ways. He was wrong, yet he showed no remorse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had landed her in prison and left her disabled, and somehow believed that his suffering canceled out the harm he had caused her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who the hell did he think he was? What incredible nerve. She couldn't even be bothered to argue with someone like him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora turned her face away, refusing to look at him. She didn't want to waste another moment on such a </span><span>jerk</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora!" Hubery's emotions were spiraling out of control. "What more do you want? Will this ever end? I've never met anyone as dramatic as you in my life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora didn't hear a word he was saying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery was shaking with rage. "Fine, fine. If this is how you're </span><span>gonna</span><span> treat me, then I don't care anymore. Cynthia, do whatever you want with her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia let out a sneer. "I told you a long time ago that a woman like her isn't worth your kindness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She put down the knife she was holding and walked into the kitchen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she returned, she was carrying a basin of scalding hot water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing before the iron cage, she cast a sardonic half-smile at Aurora. "Listen up, you bitch!" she spat. "Get down on your knees and apologize to me a hundred times! Admit your mistakes and acknowledge that you're nothing but cheap, disgusting trash. Do that, and I'll let you go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora didn't even look at her, oblivious to the venomous words being hurled her way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia's patience evaporated entirely. "Think you can play tough with me?" she snarled. "I'll show you what happens when you mess with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, that hot water was flung through the air, heading straight for Aurora.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="187.html">« Prev</a><a href="189.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
