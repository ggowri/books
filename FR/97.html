You make me sick!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words hit Adolph like a knife to the heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't believe she found him disgusting just for kissing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had loved her for eight long years, not caring that she had done time in prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All these years, he had waited faithfully for her release, dreaming of marriage, never touching another woman! He had even saved his first kiss for her, and this was how she felt!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sting of her rejection crushed Adolph's pride as a man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora turned away coldly and walked out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She saw Simon and Bertha fighting over "The Garden" embroidery when she stepped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a loud rip, the delicate needlework tore apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon froze in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flash of malicious delight crossed Bertha's face before she quickly put on an innocent expression, her eyes welling up with crocodile tears as she looked at Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha whimpered, "Aurora, I didn't mean to.

Aurora screamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha let out an agonizing scream as blood trickled down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon stood frozen in shock, staring at Aurora in disbelief. He had never imagined that she could be this violent when angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph rushed out when he heard Bertha's screams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw Aurora slamming Bertha's head against the wall like a madwoman, he was stunned momentarily before forcing Aurora away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, have you completely lost it?" he shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's eyes flashed with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lost it?" she spat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wasn't Bertha the one who ripped my hair out first? Weren't you the one who ordered me to apologize to her without even asking what happened? Wasn't she the one who destroyed my stuff?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never wanted trouble with any of you. You're always the one picking fights with me. When I fight back, I'm the crazy one. I'm supposed to take it when you bully me, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph tensed up, at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's heart shattered as she picked up her embroidery, now torn in half.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She held up the ruined piece before Adolph and demanded, "So tell me, Adolph, am I just supposed to be everyone's punching bag? Should I smile and take it when people bully me? If I stand up for myself, I'm being dramatic? Is that what you're saying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph felt a knot in his chest as he replied, "Aurora, that's not what I meant. Look... you can't go around hitting people. Bertha already said it was an accident. Why can't you just let it go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha looked at Aurora with fake tears, her voice trembling as she said, "I'm so sorry, Aurora. I didn't mean to. I'll pay you back! Whatever amount you want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph jumped in. "See, Aurora? I told you Bertha was being reasonable. She's offering to compensate you. Stop making such a big deal out of this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused before adding dismissively, "It's just some embroidery anyway. It's not worth much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smug smile crept across Bertha's face as she said with fake innocence, "Aurora, I get a million-dollar allowance monthly. I'll give it all to you as compensation, okay? I can ask Dad, Mom, and Barnett for more if that's not enough. They love me so much. They'll give me whatever I want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph chimed in. "A million is more than generous. Aurora, you need to be reasonable. You and Bertha are family! Why create drama over something so trivial? People will think you're being ridiculous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They tag-teamed Aurora, pretending to seek forgiveness while painting her as petty and unreasonable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon listened in disgust and couldn't hold back anymore, spitting out in contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who needs your dirty money? A million dollars? What do you think we are, beggars?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This 'The Garden' piece was Julian's birthday gift to Madam Hawke, which he bought at auction for twenty million dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha's smug smile instantly froze on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't believe a mere embroidery could be worth twenty million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, she wondered why Julian's possession was in the hands of that bitch Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When did that whore Aurora get to know Julian?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of Aurora catching Julian's eye early on drove Bertha jealous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Adolph, she noticed his face had turned equally grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had come today specifically to discuss the East Suburb project with Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything was ruined if this embroidery was truly Julian's birthday gift for Beatrice!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had not only destroyed a significant business deal but might have permanently offended Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha stared at Aurora in disbelief, her voice trembling with panic. "Aurora, this isn't true, is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora took a deep breath, not wanting to waste more words with them, and turned to Simon, "Simon, call Mr. Hawke and ask him to come over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon's expression turned serious, but Adolph snatched the phone away just as he was about to dial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" Adolph shouted, his brows furrowed tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He absolutely couldn't let Julian know about this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least not until he figured out a solution. Otherwise, his chances of participating in the East Suburb project would be shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon was furious, trying to snatch the phone back from Adolph's grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they continued to argue, a woman's voice suddenly rang out from behind them. "The party is about to start, Bertha. We've been looking all over for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha looked up to see Judy strutting towards them with a group of wealthy socialites.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy was dressed in an elegant gown with flawless makeup, exuding sophistication. However, when her eyes landed on Aurora, her expression turned ice-cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, if it isn't the little homewrecker," she sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora froze, confused by the stranger's intense hostility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before she could ask if there had been a misunderstanding, Judy announced to her entourage, "This is the slut who's been sleeping with my husband."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="96.html">« Prev</a><a href="98.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
