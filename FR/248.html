"Yes, I don't deserve it. Aurora, I understand. I won't show u</span><span>p</span><span> again. </span><span>W</span><span>ish you </span><span>a lifetime of </span><span>happiness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora got into the car without looking</span><span> back</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wouldn't forgive Joshua, let alone Celeste, who was even more detestable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua had schemed against her because he had always been convinced that Bertha was his biological daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, even aware that Bertha was merely an adopted child, Celeste had gone to great lengths to humiliate her own daughter for Bertha's sake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Aurora had been reborn, the events of her past life couldn't be swept under the rug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forgiving Celeste and Joshua was tantamount to betraying Lily, who had resorted to murder to avenge her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Aurora firmly refused to forgive them, vowing to maintain her stance unwaveringly until her last breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door closed slowly, and the car pulled away. Celeste remained rooted to the spot, gazing vacantly at the receding vehicle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I deserve it. I'm not worthy of your forgiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With so little time remaining, I just hope I can hear you call me Mom one last time before my death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste shook violently and almost fell, as if all her strength had been drained away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, someone supported her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste looked over and met Barnett's concerned gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste nodded. "Yes, I'm fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett had only been out for a few weeks after doing a ten-year stretch that crushed his ego to dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What messed with his head was how prison felt weirdly familiar, even though this was supposed to be his first time behind bars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he often had nightmares.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his dreams, Barnett targeted and hurt Aurora in every possible way, scolding and beating her. Even though Bertha's acting was so poor, her family had turned a blind eye to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These dreams endured for a decade, torturing him relentlessly and causing him immeasurable suffering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no clue what those dreams meant till Celeste spilled the tea after he got out, came back home, and told her what went down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As it turned out, nothing was a dream, and it had all taken place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her former life, Aurora had been tortured and crippled by them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It dawned on Barnett that </span><span>his </span><span>nightmares every night were </span><span>all </span><span>because he had committed many wrongdoings in his previous life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, Aurora won't forgive us. What should we do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A vice-like grip seized Celeste's chest, and without warning, a trickle of blood began to seep from her nostrils and dribble from the corners of her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She fainted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom!" Barnett shouted in horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste gave a bitter laugh. Her miserable situation was indeed retribution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the hospital, Celeste slowly woke up. She pulled out the drip</span><span> </span><span>and got out of bed, walking towards the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was about to open the door when the conversation between the doctor and Barnett rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your mother is in the late stage of gastric cancer. She has at most half a year left."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Doctor, please save her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry. We caught it too late. Instead of wasting money, you might as well take her home and let her spend her last days as she pleases."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the doctor stepped away, leaving Barnett leaning against the wall in despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door opened, and Celeste came out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett immediately looked up. "Mom, d-did you hear that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste nodded. "Yes. I don't want any treatment. Let's go home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cut the crap. Treating advanced cancer is a futile effort."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste suddenly thought of Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, her three years at the Elvador Villa were marked by a lack of proper meals. She was constantly hungry throughout the day and could only make do with leftovers after coming home from school at night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During her time in the orphanage, she had no stomach problems, but she developed one shortly after her return to the Elvador family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had long assumed Celeste was unaware of her stomach ailment. In truth, Celeste knew full well, yet feigned indifference, never truly showing concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One night, Barnett's stomach disease flared up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like always, Aurora was the one taking care of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Same deal that night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste got up to hit the bathroom and caught Aurora in the living room, looking beat, popping stomach meds after dealing with Barnett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's when it clicked&mdash;Aurora had the same stomach issues.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She always figured that since Aurora grew up in an orphanage and was used to rough stuff, a bad stomach wouldn't be a big deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now Celeste finally got it&mdash;just because someone can take it doesn't mean they ain't hurting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her previous life, Aurora faced numerous hardships.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this life, the torment of stomachaches fell upon Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, you're so sick. You should tell Aurora. After all, she is your daughter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste gave a mocking smile. "</span><span>W</span><span>hen Aurora was too sick to get out of bed, not a single person in our family cared about her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exited the hospital and headed back to Orley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the past ten years, Celeste had been working continuously. Only through constant busyness could she keep her mind from wandering into excessive rumination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Consequently, she and Barnett continued to reside in the villa, leading a life free from concerns about basic necessities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disease quickly took a toll on Celeste, confining her to bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She left all her assets to Barnett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hesitated briefly and then asked, "Mom, don't you plan to set aside something for Aurora?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's eyes betrayed pain. "I wish I could. But </span><span>she</span><span>'s eager to sever all connections with us. So how on earth could she be willing to accept anything from me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barnett, </span><span>you should take these</span><span>. If Aurora forgives you</span><span> someday</span><span>, give her the share that rightfully belongs to her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time went by, and half a year elapsed in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste was so brutally tormented that she shed a significant amount of weight. She became emaciated, lying in bed with a skeletal appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staring at her, Barnett couldn't hold back his tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I'm going to find Aurora right now. Hold on, and I will bring her here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste exerted all her strength to halt him. Her voice was a faint whisper. "Don't go. I can't bear for her to </span><span>see</span><span> me in this state. It will surely frighten her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that even if Barnett went to find Aurora, she wouldn't come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste just hoped that she could maintain her dignity until she died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were dull.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Aurora, you have a heart of stone. Even when I'm dying, you won't forgive me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But I have no right to blame you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Even if I die laden with regrets, it's all on me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If there is an afterlife, I hope to be reborn and remember everything earlier before losing you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, her heavy eyelids closed, and her breath ceased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Putnam, Aurora suddenly felt a pang in her heart, almost making her unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian immediately summoned the family doctor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After examining Aurora, the doctor smiled, "Congratulations, Mr. Hawke. Mrs. Hawke is pregnant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was over the moon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So that's why she'd been feeling off&mdash;she had a baby on the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like that, all her weird symptoms didn't matter anymore.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="247.html">« Prev</a><a href="249.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
