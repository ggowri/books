She hung up the phone directly and strode toward the cafeteria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was lunchtime, and the cafeteria was crowded. Lily waited in line for a long time before finally getting a plate of her favorite beef pasta.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She carried her plate and found an empty seat in the corner, starting to eat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could take more than a few bites, whispers began behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look behind you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's so shameless.

If it were me, I'd hide at home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Having a sugar daddy is great, huh? She can make money just by lying down. Don't you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily paused slightly at the harsh words, but after a moment, she continued eating as if nothing had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was used to such gossip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">In less than a year, Aurora and I will leave this place. These rumors can't hurt me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily thought that if she ignored them, they would stop. But the group only grew bolder, occasionally throwing tissues, breadcrumbs, and food scraps at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sauce from the food splattered on her hair and skin, leaving her with a foul smell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily slowly put down her fork, picked up her plate, and suddenly turned around, dumping the remaining beef pasta onto the head of the girl behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A piercing scream echoed through the cafeteria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone, whether eating or waiting in line, turned to look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl had noodles on her head, sauce dripping down her hair, looking utterly disheveled. Her face was a mix of shock and anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily put down her plate and turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, stop there!" the girl's friend suddenly shouted angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily acted as if she hadn't heard and continued walking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ignored girl felt humiliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She yelled furiously, "Lily, are you deaf? You bullied my friend, and now you're just going to walk away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she reached out, trying to grab Lily's hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before her hand could touch Lily, Lily swiftly turned around, grabbed her wrist, and with a smooth motion, threw the girl over her shoulder, slamming her hard onto the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily stepped on the girl's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Had enough?" Lily asked coldly, her voice icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl was in so much pain from the fall that she nearly passed out. With Lily stepping on her chest, she could barely breathe, her face turning red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily looked down at her, her gaze like a god looking down at an ant, making the girl tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry..." the girl cried, begging for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily sneered, "You really are a masochist, aren't you? You only feel satisfied after being beaten."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone around them stared in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never expected that Lily, who seemed like a well-behaved student, could be so ruthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone stepped forward to defend the girl, "Lily, stop this. Everyone's watching. Aren't you afraid of being expelled if the principal finds out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily scoffed, "Then go ahead and report me!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl who had spoken up wasn't ready to back down. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bullying classmates and being so arrogant&mdash;you don't deserve to be a student here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Lily slowly turned around and walked step by step toward her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you going to do?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl, intimidated by Lily's presence, stepped back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a word, Lily slapped her hard across the face. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she grabbed leftover food from a nearby table and smeared it all over the girl's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is what I call arrogance. Got it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl didn't dare fight back. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was covered in curry and salad dressing. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her once carefully applied makeup was ruined, and she burst into tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All around, people were condemning Lily, but she ignored them completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lately, because of Aurora's situation, Lily had been in a bad mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone who provoked her became her punching bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was pure and kind, but Lily was the complete opposite. Lily was ruthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She strode out of the cafeteria. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she passed by three girls from her dorm, they instinctively gave her ingratiating smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily acted as if she didn't see them and walked straight out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three girls breathed a sigh of relief. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged glances, each seeing fear in the other's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew Lily's true nature better than anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">In public, Lily used to at least pretend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Now, she's completely let go of any pretense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Anyone who provokes Lily will face a terrible fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily pushed open the door to the principal's office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She walked in casually and rudely plopped down on the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just beat up three people in the cafeteria. They might come to complain later. You know what to do, right?"
