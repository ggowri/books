The rest of the space was crammed with junk. The yellowed walls reeked of dampness, with cobwebs clinging to the corners.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What the hell is this?" Barnett exploded, scanning the dismal space. "She's my sister, Daisy. Who told you to stick her in this dump?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But... but Mr. Elvador," Daisy stammered, looking crushed. "You did. You specifically told me to put her here. Don't you remember?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I never-" Barnett's voice died in his throat as the memory hit him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eight years ago, when Aurora first moved in, he'd told her to pick any room she wanted. She'd chosen the guest room next to his, but he'd shot that down immediately. "Can't. That's gonna be my office."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When she suggested the room by Bertha's, he'd dismissed that too. "Bertha needs that for her art studio."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Finally, Aurora suggested the attic. He'd scoffed, shaking his head. "Are you kidding? My sister living in an attic? The neighbors would have a field day with that gossip. No way. Daisy, there's got to be something else."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Well..." Daisy had hesitated. "There's the storage room..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Fine. Clear it out. She can use that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He'd just assumed the storage room would be like the other guest rooms - bright, airy, comfortable. He never bothered to check that it was actually a cramped, dark box without even a window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Now, images of Aurora spending night after night in that cold, lonely room flooded his mind, and the pain in his chest deepened. His chest tightened as he realized the cruel irony - in this massive mansion where even the servants had their own comfortable quarters, his own sister had been banished to that cold, moldy space for three long years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The weight of this truth crushed him, and his face grew darker with each passing moment of reflection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Elvador," Daisy ventured carefully, "the storage room's no good for her. She could stay in my room-"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No." Barnett cut her off sharply, though his chest tightened with a painful mix of remorse and worry. He took a steadying breath. "Just call Darren and have him come to my room."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Without another word, he scooped up Aurora's limp form and strode toward his bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Daisy watched him disappear down the hallway, a small smile tugging at her lips. Maybe there was hope after all. For all his cold shoulders and harsh words, today he'd finally acted like the big brother he was supposed to be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She quickly dialed the doctor, Darren Lowell's number. "Hello, Dr. Lowell? Ms. Elvador is unwell. Please come over right away..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Five minutes later, the bedroom door creaked open as Darren strolled in, a playful grin on his face. "Yo Elvador, you're such a softie with Bertha, man. Called me over for a little fever? And now she's crashed in your room too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His words died in his throat as he spotted Aurora lying pale-faced on the bed. His expression instantly hardened, all traces of humor vanishing. "No. I don't treat criminals." He grabbed his medical bag, turning toward the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Darren." Barnett's voice was quiet but carried steel in its tone. "That's my sister you're talking about. Watch your mouth."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Darren's eyes turned cold as ice. "Blood sister or not, what about Bertha? She's the one who actually grew up with you, man. And Camille? She's lying in a hospital bed like a vegetable because of Aurora. Five years in prison doesn't make up for destroying someone's life. She gets to walk around free while Camille might never wake up. How is that fair?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Barnett's face twisted with inner conflict, his fists clenching and unclenching. Torn between his blood sister and the harsh reality of what she'd done to the people he loved, he felt paralyzed. The guilt of caring for Aurora warred with the memory of Bertha's tears and Camille's motionless body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Look," he said quietly but firmly, "I get it. But she's still my sister."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Darren's gaze flickered to Aurora's gaunt, frail face. His lips curled into a sneer dripping with derision. "Someone as cruel as her? If I cured her, she'd only go on to hurt others."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Darren!" Barnett snapped, his eyes meeting his friend's with a desperate intensity. "Just... look at her leg, okay? The right one."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They stared each other down until Darren finally caved with a heavy sigh. "Whatever, man. I'll check her out. But don't think this means I'm treating her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He dropped his medical bag by the bed, roughly yanking up Aurora's pant leg while grumbling, "Can't believe you're wasting time on someone who'd&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His voice died mid-sentence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Darren stood there, shocked into silence. The leg before him was barely recognizable as human &ndash; twisted bone pushing against paper-thin skin, muscles completely wasted away. An ugly scar zigzagged across the pale surface like a grotesque lightning bolt, surrounded by angry purple bruising.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His hand trembled slightly as he reached toward the misshapen bone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even with all his anger toward Aurora, his medical instincts kicked in at the sight of such severe damage. The injury was brutal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Her leg wasn't always this messed up, was it?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Barnett's face darkened. "No way. She was fine for those three years at home. Perfect legs."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The implication hit Darren hard - this had happened in prison. He kept his face neutral and focused on the examination, but his mind was racing with what that meant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As Darren's examination continued, his face darkened with each discovery. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Aurora's condition was horrifying. Her body showed clear signs of long-term abuse - old scars layered under new ones, and her frame was dangerously thin from years without proper food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Dude, we need to talk," Darren muttered, his voice rough with emotion as he stood up. "Outside. Now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Once in the study, Barnett faced him. "What'd you find?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Darren took a deep breath before speaking. "You know how tough human bones are?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Barnett shook his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"They're like, crazy strong," Darren said, leaning forward. "Especially the ones in your legs - the tibia and fibula. You'd need something major to break them this bad - like getting hit by a car or falling off a building."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But she was locked up, so that couldn't have happened. This?" He gestured grimly. "Someone did this to her. With something heavy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"And the worst part? Nobody treated it properly. The bones just... healed wrong. That's why her leg looks like this now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Just thinking about how much pain she went through..." Darren's voice trailed off. "It's insane she survived all that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Barnett's hands started shaking, his fingers curling into fists so tight his knuckles went white.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His bloodshot eyes burned with rage, and the fury within him swelled like molten lava, threatening to consume him entirely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"In prison... How dare they?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Visions of Aurora's frail body enduring blow after blow flashed through his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A searing pain gripped his chest, nearly knocking him unconscious. He fought to control the rage building inside him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Darren, tell me straight - can we fix her leg?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No man, it's been three years," Darren said quietly. "That ship's sailed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Barnett stood there, paralyzed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He barely registered Darren leaving. When reality finally seeped back in, he found himself collapsed in a chair, exhausted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His thoughts were a mess. He reached for his smokes out of habit, but his hands were shaking too bad to work the lighter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Damn it!" He threw the cigarette down and grabbed his head, fingers digging into his scalp.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He curled up, his body trembling as ragged breaths escaped through clenched teeth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Minutes stretched like hours, the silence broken only by his labored breathing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Finally, he steadied himself. Looking up with steel in his eyes, he pulled out his phone and called Morgan Klein, his secretary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Morgan," he growled, voice deadly quiet. "I want everything on Aurora's five years inside. Every. Single. Detail."</p><div class="pagination"><a href="8.html">« Prev</a><a href="10.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
