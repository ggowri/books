He showed an expression so hideous that it seemed to belong to a demon from hell, sending shivers down the spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You damned bitch!" </span><span>Hubery</span><span> roared, filled with raw, seething anger. He shouted, "I'm going to kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His madness surged like an outbreak of insanity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha, watching </span><span>Hubery's</span><span> deranged state, felt an overwhelming thrill, unlike anything she had experienced before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her laughter, sharp and ear-piercing, intertwined with his furious shouts, creating an eerie chorus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The madder </span><span>Hubery</span><span> became, the more wildly she laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on! If you have the guts, kill me!" Bertha taunted, her voice dripping with scorn and contempt. "You pathetic loser! Now you regret everything? Too late!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she twisted her body provocatively as if flaunting her victory before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The commotion soon drew the attention of the guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two policemen swiftly approached from either side and restrained </span><span>Hubery</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he continued to thrash about, his legs kicking wildly and his body writhing as he tried to break free and charge at Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me go! Let me go!" </span><span>Hubery</span><span> screamed in a frenzied, hoarse voice, nearly breaking under the strain. He added, "I'm going to kill her! I must kill her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze never wavered from Bertha, burning with a hatred that seemed capable of incinerating her whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha's smile grew even more brilliant as she watched </span><span>Hubery</span><span> being dragged away by the police.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She even pulled a mocking face at him and sneered, "Go ahead and wallow in regret out there.

Everything had ended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His once brilliant career had burst like fragile bubbles, and Aurora, the one he treasured most, had been driven into an abyss by his own hands, leaving no room for forgiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he had nothing left but overwhelming remorse and crushing loneliness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, his eyes filled with tears, and hot drops rolled down his cheeks, staining his tattered clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, I never meant for this. I just wanted to take care of you." he murmured. But there was no one around to hear his belated confession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the Hawke Estate, warm lights spilled through the windows onto the garden path, adding a touch of gentle calm to the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice gazed at Aurora with maternal affection. "Aurora, you're not well. Go back and sleep</span><span>.</span><span>" she advised kindly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora shook her head slightly. "Madam Hawke, I'll wait a little longer for Mr. Hawke."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice's heart filled with joy when she heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes inadvertently fell on the ring on Aurora's finger, and her smile grew ever brighter. Her face radiated pure happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That ring was no ordinary trinket. It was a cherished heirloom from Julian's mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For years, Julian had treasured it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a child, he had hung it on a cord around his neck, and later, as he grew older, he wore it on his little finger every moment of every day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, having given this precious ring to Aurora, Julian was clearly declaring that he truly intended to share his life with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm heading upstairs now. Don't wait too long," Beatrice said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora nodded obediently, watching Beatrice go up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she settled quietly on the sofa in the living room, her thoughts drifting back to her days at the </span><span>Elvador</span><span> Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, every time she returned from school, she was greeted by a dark, empty living room, and the cold air seemed intent on swallowing her whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing alone in that darkness, feeling the chill of neglect and the sting of being forgotten by her family, was a sensation she would never forget.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, it was Daisy who had left the light on for her. It was a small beacon in the darkness that offered her a rare bit of comfort amid the harshness of the </span><span>Elvador</span><span> Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having experienced the bitter coldness of family indifference, Aurora cherished the warmth of the Hawke family all the more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to wait Julian, because the fifteen-year-old version of herself who had braved the snow was longing for someone to be there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Minutes passed, and the villa lay silent except for the steady tick-tock of the clock in the living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Growing weary, Aurora eventually dozed off on the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her fragile health, fatigue came easily, and sleep overtook her as she slowly closed her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curling up slightly on the sofa, she sought the comfort of a secure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Julian finally returned, he found the small, slumbering figure of Aurora on the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glancing around the living room, he didn't see either Beatrice or Ashley. Clearly, they had already gone to bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Did she stay up just to leave the light on for me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's typically cold and stern expression softened imperceptibly the moment he saw her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He deliberately lightened his steps as he approached her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bending down, he carefully slipped his arms around her back and legs, lifting her effortlessly into his embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With long strides, he carried her upstairs, gently laying her on the bed before pulling the blanket over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire process was done with the utmost care as if afraid of disturbing her sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. </span><span>Elvador</span><span>, sweet dreams." Julian's voice echoed softly in the quiet room, carrying a hint of tenderness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned and walked out, closing the door behind him with a light touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of returning to his bedroom, Julian headed straight for the study.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seating himself at the desk, he switched on the lamp, the soft light casting shadows over his sharp features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He began sorting through the towering stack of documents, the only sound in the room being the soft scratch of a pen moving across the paper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>About 15 minutes later, the shrill ring of the telephone broke the silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawke, I just saw </span><span>Hubery</span><span>." Ethan's voice came through the line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dropping Julian off at home, Ethan </span><span>drove</span><span> back toward his own place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Halfway there, he remembered he was out of cigarettes and pulled over to buy some.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he stepped out, he caught the faint sound of groaning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curious, he followed the sound to the entrance of a dark alley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the dim glow of the streetlamp, he saw </span><span>Hubery</span><span> sprawled on the ground, covered in blood, a pitiful sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words </span><span>Hubery</span><span> had said to Aurora at the hospital earlier in the day had already been relayed to Julian by Daniel, and Ethan was also present, he was well aware of everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing </span><span>Hubery</span><span> beaten within an inch of his life, he had decided to call Julian for further instructions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian pondered briefly before speaking in a cold tone, "Take him to the hospital. Make sure he doesn't die. But don't let him live well, either."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's heart jolted, and he hesitated for a moment before asking, "Mr. Hawke, you mean to make him suffer?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian showed a chilling smirk, devoid of any warmth. "His legs are already useless. No need to keep them. Amputate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan felt a chill run from his feet to his head at Julian's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although </span><span>Hubery's</span><span> legs had been broken, with proper care he could have recovered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who, he wondered, had reduced </span><span>Hubery</span><span> to such a state? If left to lie in the alley for one more night, death wouldn't be far off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up the phone, Ethan followed Julian's orders and transported </span><span>Hubery</span><span> to the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the person responsible for beating </span><span>Hubery</span><span> nearly to death was calmly undressing, removing the bloodstained clothes and gloves with a composed, unhurried air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the person took out a lighter and ignited it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flames leaped up instantly, engulfing the garments and gloves, the fire's light flickering over the person's face.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="130.html">« Prev</a><a href="132.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
