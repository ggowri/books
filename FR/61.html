Not like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five years ago, she had been falsely accused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, she wouldn't let history repeat itself. She had to act fast and save Camille.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go of me. I need to save Camille!" she demanded, struggling against Beatrice's hold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice hesitated for a moment, concern flickering in her eyes, but eventually released her grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora took a step toward Camille, but before she could move any further, Barnett lunged in front of her, blocking her way, while Hubery quickly positioned himself on the other side, preventing her from reaching Camille.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's eyes were ice-cold as he spoke sharply, "Aurora, enough! You tried to kill Camille before, and now you're going to finish the job in front of us? What happened to you? You've become a cruel, heartless woman. You're nothing but a vicious, poisonous witch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's voice was laced with disappointment. "Aurora, I'm warning you&mdash;stop now. If you keep this up, it won't just be five years in prison. With the Sherwood family's influence, you'll rot in there for the rest of your life. And no matter how much history we share, I won't care about you anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of my way! If you don't help her, she's going to die! Are you really just going to watch her die?" Aurora's voice was a mix of desperation and anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Barnett and Hubery refused to budge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha pretended to sound sympathetic. "Aurora, even if you hate Camille, you can't kill her. Even if she wakes up and exposes the crimes you've committed, you've already paid your dues in prison. The law won't pursue you further. There's no need for you to go this far."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett clenched his fists, sneering. "Aurora, look at you now&mdash;acting like a madwoman. You belong in prison for life, never to see the light of day again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's brows were furrowed in frustration. "How long are you going to stay this way? Are you really determined to end up in prison again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's anger surged like wildfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew arguing with them was pointless, so she stopped wasting words. In a burst of frustration, she grabbed a small knife from the nightstand and began waving it wildly in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of my way&mdash;get away from me!" Aurora screamed, her eyes bloodshot, her voice wild with rage, as if she were a demon risen from the depths of hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't care anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Camille died, so would she.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't let Camille die, not for her own sake&mdash;she couldn't let it happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett and Hubery, caught off guard by her sudden outburst, quickly backed away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Barnett wasn't quick enough. The knife sliced across his cheek, drawing a line of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you crazy?" Barnett shouted, clutching his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's voice was hoarse but firm. "Get away from me, or I'll kill you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett, shaken, realized how close he had come to being seriously hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was his sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't doubt for a second that she had meant it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had been any slower, the blade would've hit his throat instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He backed off, eyes wide, and didn't dare get any closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery, equally stunned by Aurora's unhinged behavior, stood frozen, staring at her. He studied her as though trying to reconcile the fierce, ruthless woman before him with the sunny, carefree girl he once knew. The contrast was stark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora... how did you end up like this?" Hubery murmured, his voice filled with confusion and sorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora paid no attention to their words. All that mattered now was saving Camille.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Beatrice, Ashley, and Daisy rushed in, quickly separating Barnett and Hubery from Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy, her eyes filled with determination, turned to Aurora and said loudly, "Ms. Elvador, do whatever you need to do. I'll always support you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice and Ashley nodded in agreement, their eyes filled with trust and encouragement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's heart swelled with gratitude and emotion, and before she could hold it back, tears started to fall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her own family had never believed in her, constantly hurting her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only warmth she had received had come from Daisy and strangers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her family had abandoned her, but the world hadn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't know whether she was lucky or unlucky to find kindness from unexpected places.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were so many things she wanted to say, but in this moment of intense urgency, she couldn't find the words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora quickly turned, throwing the knife&mdash;now stained with Barnett's blood&mdash;aside. She rushed to Camille's bedside and immediately began performing CPR.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hands moved quickly and with purpose, pressing firmly on Camille's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She repeated over and over, "Camille, you have to wake up. You can't die. I've already served five years for you. Do you want me to be sentenced to death for your death?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't afraid of death, but she couldn't bear the thought of her enemies living on while she perished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha watched from the side, her heart racing with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had used all her strength when choking Camille earlier, but before she could confirm whether Camille was truly dead, Aurora had barged in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was terrified that Aurora might succeed in saving Camille.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes flashed with panic, but with everyone else focused on Aurora and Camille, no one noticed her anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time passed, seconds stretching into what felt like an eternity. Sweat poured down Aurora's face, soaking her clothes, while her arms, sore from the continuous pressure, had nearly lost feeling. But with her relentless willpower, she continued, each movement precise and mechanical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Camille's lifeless face made her heart ache with helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"Come on, Camille... You have to live</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span><span style="font-style: italic;">"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora carefully pinched Camille's nose, took a deep breath, lowered her head, and began mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha, watching, began to relax when Camille still showed no signs of waking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint, cruel smile tugged at her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Camille is definitely dead now. There's nothing to worry about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett and Hubery exchanged glances, conflicted and confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Aurora truly wanted Camille dead, why was she now desperately trying to save her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it all just a show for them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From what they knew of Aurora, pretending to care was more likely than true concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their looks turned to scorn, and Barnett sneered, "Aurora, don't think that pretending to save Camille with this little act will clear you of your past crimes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery sighed deeply, "Aurora, you've really disappointed me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice couldn't take it any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These two men, well-dressed and seemingly well-educated, had just proven themselves utterly foolish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her anger flared up, and she snapped, "Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice boomed with authority, silencing both men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora felt her strength waning. Her arms felt as heavy as lead, and her lips were numb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gritted her teeth and pressed down once more on Camille's chest. Then, she repeated the resuscitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as hope began to slip away, Camille suddenly coughed, the air that had been trapped in her chest finally escaping. Slowly, her eyes fluttered open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's heart leaped in her chest. She squeezed Camille's hand tightly, her eyes brimming with tears of relief. Just as she opened her mouth to speak, Adolph burst in with a doctor in tow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Camille awake, Adolph was overwhelmed with joy, but then his gaze landed on Aurora standing there, holding Camille's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You stay away from my Camille!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="60.html">« Prev</a><a href="62.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
