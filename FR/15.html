What else do I have to be afraid of?" said Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett stared at her intently, and Aurora met his gaze without showing any sign of weakness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, Barnett saw the loathing for him in Aurora's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Does she hate me now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No way! </span><span style="font-style: italic;">She used to be so obedient and always put me first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">For three years, I got used to her admiration. I can't handle her sudden change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I even crossed Adolph, Bertha's fianc&eacute;, for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I've done so much&mdash;what more does she want?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Barnett said with a fierce expression, "Aurora, if you dare to run away again, I'll fire Daisy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's heart clenched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Daisy is the only person in the Elvador Villa who is kind to me. If Daisy loses her job because of me, I will feel guilty for the rest of my life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora clenched her hands into fists, pretending not to care. "You firing your servant has nothing to do with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">As long as I pretend not to care, Daisy won't be fired by Barnett, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she was thinking this, Barnett sneered, "Is that so? Then I'll not only fire Daisy but also expel Daisy's daughter from school."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy's daughter was Lily Walker, a sophomore in college this year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five years ago, when Lily was in junior high school, she had ridden a bicycle in the rain to deliver Aurora's </span><span>SAT</span><span> admission ticket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because the road was wet and slippery, she unfortunately broke her right hand and almost couldn't take the </span><span>SSAT.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Aurora returned home after the </span><span>SAT</span><span>, Daisy told her that her admission ticket had been thrown into the trash can by someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Daisy hadn't found it in time, it would have been taken away and disposed of by the sanitation worker collecting the garbage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora thought, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">"I have owed Daisy and Lily so much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If they lose their jobs and studies because of me, it will be more painful than killing me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's whole body tensed up, and the anger in her heart was almost uncontrollable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that she didn't speak, Barnett thought she still wouldn't give in and continued, "I heard that Daisy's daughter is very good at studying and always gets scholarships. If she were to be expelled from school..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A loud slap interrupted Barnett's words and turned his head to the side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren, who saw everything through the rear-view mirror, widened his eyes in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Did Aurora slap Barnett?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I couldn't have dreamed of such an absurd thing, but it is happening right in front of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I thought Aurora was timid. But unexpectedly, she showed her claws.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Even a rabbit will bite when it's cornered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Compared to her humble self, the rebellious Aurora rather piques my interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Darren smiled, "Barnett, does it hurt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's face was extremely gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was thin and weak, and she hadn't eaten or drunk anything for a day and a night. Her slap was gentle and didn't hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, being slapped in the face, Barnett didn't feel his face hurt but was heartbroken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought his sister shouldn't be so disobedient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett was completely enraged by this unexpected slap. His eyes were instantly bloodshot. He suddenly reached out, gripping Aurora's neck like iron pincers and pressing her forcefully onto the seat with both hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora felt a sharp pain in her neck and difficulty breathing, and her lungs seemed like they were about to burst. Every breath became extremely difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, her face turned purple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren quickly said, "Barnett, stop choking her. You'll kill her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good riddance if she dies," said Barnett harshly, but his hands loosened their grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren wasn't happy about it. "Don't let her die in my car. I think it's unlucky."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett suddenly pushed Aurora away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora slumped to the side of the seat like a broken doll and started coughing violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett glared at Aurora viciously and roared, "Listen to me carefully. It is the last time you go against me. If you dare to do this again, Daisy and her daughter will end up worse than you can imagine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice echoed in the car, carrying an undeniable deterrence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora lowered her eyelids, concealing the look of annoyance in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the rest of the journey, no one spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour later, they returned to the Elvador Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they got out of the car, Celeste rushed up and reached out to grab Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Aurora withdrew her hand as if she had been electrocuted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's hand froze in mid-air, and a trace of embarrassment flashed across her face. But she quickly adjusted her expression and said with concern, "Aurora, you're such a stubborn child. What your father said was just out of anger. How could you take it seriously? Don't do this again. You don't know how worried I was."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha also quickly came up and took Celeste's arm, chiming in, "Aurora, you almost scared us to death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's expression was cold as she stood there quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they finished speaking, she walked straight inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's attitude once again enraged Barnett. He shouted, "Aurora, stop right there. Can't you feel that Mom and Bertha care about you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stopped and turned around. Looking at Celeste and Bertha's still-damp hair and their pajamas, she said sarcastically, "Were they worried about me while taking a bath or while sleeping?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These two had prepared to go to bed after taking a bath after Aurora had left the Elvador Villa. There was no time for them to worry about her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air fell into an awkward silence, and Celeste's eyes unconsciously evaded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett was stunned. He opened his mouth, wanting to say something to explain but found that he couldn't come up with any reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had long been aware of the hypocrisy of this family. She wasn't surprised by what happened tonight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She walked straight into the villa without looking at anyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The night grew deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett lay on the soft big bed, tossing and turning, unable to sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After struggling for a long time, he couldn't help but get out of bed, go downstairs, and walk towards Aurora's utility room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was no place for a person to live.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>E</span><span>ven the doghouse in the house was more luxurious than this utility room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing in front of the utility room door, Barnett hesitated for a long time, not daring to knock, yet not willing to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lingered like this, standing in front of the door for half an hour. Finally, a slight pain came from his stomach, and he had to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, Aurora had slept quite well. Maybe it was because she was too tired last night or because her nerves had been too relaxed since leaving prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to her, the </span><span>others</span><span> all looked not so well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett looked even more tired, showing that he hadn't slept well last night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They sat around the dining table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua said seriously, "Aurora, the driver will take you to Orley Central Hospital later. As long as you show Adolph your sincerity, I believe he won't make things difficult for you, and he will continue to cooperate with Elvador Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora lowered her eyes, remaining silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing this, Joshua's anger flared up. "Are you dumb?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste quickly tried to smooth things over. "Let's have breakfast first. We can talk about it after we finish eating."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The maid placed the prepared breakfast in front of Joshua, Celeste, Barnett, and Bertha one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But only Aurora's portion was missing.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="14.html">« Prev</a><a href="16.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
