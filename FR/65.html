Camille hasn't complained about the noise, hasn't said she needs rest, yet you're in such a rush to kick us out. What are you hiding?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch your mouth!" Isabella's voice shot up several octaves, her eyes burning with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stepped closer, her gaze sharp as a blade. "You're the one who should be careful with your words. You might be the hospital director, but that doesn't give you the right to silence a victim who's about to name her attacker. If you keep interfering, I'll have no choice but to suspect you're deliberately shielding a murderer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Camille will name the culprit today. No one is stopping this." Aurora's unyielding stance sent Isabella's temper flaring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella's face darkened, a vein twitching at her temple. She was practically trembling with rage, but with so many people present, she had no way to lash out without exposing herself. Grinding her teeth, she threatened, "If you keep making a scene, I'll have security throw you out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora remained unfazed, stepping forward until she was nearly nose-to-nose with Isabella. "Go ahead. Call them. Let's see how long you can keep your position once word spreads that the esteemed hospital director is covering up for a criminal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella visibly tensed, her outstretched hand hovering over the emergency call button, suddenly frozen in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua, who had been standing nearby, immediately stepped in. His eyes flared with fury as he grabbed Aurora's arm. "You ungrateful brat! Haven't you humiliated us enough? Get out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora yanked her arm free, her own rage burning just as fiercely. "You call me the disgrace? You and Mom have spent five years shielding Bertha while your own daughter rotted in prison! And now that Camille can expose the truth, you're desperate to stop it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You!" Joshua's face turned an ugly shade of purple, his breath coming in furious bursts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste clutched her chest, her voice shaking with sobs. "Aurora, please stop. Let's just go home and talk about this as a family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's eyes brimmed with bitter disappointment. "Home? So you can cover up for Bertha again? You two are so afraid of her facing consequences, but you never hesitated to let me take the fall."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words struck like a whip, leaving Joshua momentarily speechless, while Celeste had already dissolved into tears, gasping for breath as her sobs shook her frail frame, her body swaying with the effort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, this isn't who you are! You're my daughter, my flesh and blood. How could I bear to let you suffer? Everything I've done, it's all for your own good!" Celeste's voice cracked with desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For my own good?" Aurora sneered inwardly. "Is letting me suffer over and over again really what's best for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've spent five years taking the fall for her. All I want now is for Camille to point out the real culprit right here, right now. If you truly cared about me, you wouldn't stop me. This isn't just unfair to me&mdash;it's even more unfair to Camille."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua and Celeste were left speechless, unable to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one knew the truth better than he and Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua had seen Bertha push Camille down those stairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste had watched the security footage capturing the crime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet back then, Aurora had no evidence. No one believed her cries of innocence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Camille was awake and could finally confirm what had really happened, of course Aurora wouldn't let this chance slip away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella, watching Bertha tremble in fear, felt her heart twist. She had spent years protecting Bertha, raising her as if she were her own. Seeing Aurora press on so relentlessly ignited a deep resentment within her. Pointing a finger at Aurora, she snapped, "If you keep this up, I'm calling the police!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's lips curled into a smirk. "Oh? Go ahead. Call them. I'd love for the police to be here when we finally expose the real villain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella was only bluffing&mdash;there was no way she would actually call the authorities. But her teeth ground together as she glared at Aurora, her eyes burning with malice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's suspicion about Isabella grew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something was off about her. But in this moment, all that mattered was proving her innocence. She couldn't afford to waste time wondering why Isabella was so intent on shielding Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe Joshua and Celeste had bribed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella remained frozen, unwilling to make a move. Aurora's patience thinned. "You said you were going to call the police, so why aren't you doing it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella hesitated, trapped by her own words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora, unfazed, pulled out her phone. "Fine, if you're not going to do it, I will. It's been five years&mdash;the truth deserves to come out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She dialed 911, her finger hovering over the call button.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could press it, a large hand shot out, snatching her phone and hurling it to the floor. The device shattered on impact, its screen splintering into pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora barely had time to process what happened before a harsh slap struck her across the face, sending her crashing into Camille's hospital bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cheek stung with a fire that burned beneath her skin, and her ears rang from the impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You ungrateful brat!" Joshua's voice roared, full of venom. "What the hell do you think you're doing, embarrassing the family like this? Are you trying to ruin us?!" His eyes blazed as he raised his hand again, his fury building to a boiling point. He looked ready to strike her with everything he had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora didn't care. The pain in her face was nothing compared to the terror rising in her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her only focus was Camille, who had just regained consciousness after a long coma. Her fragile body had been knocked out again when Aurora collided with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Camille! Camille!" Aurora's voice shook, her eyes brimming with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, wake up! Please, just hold on for a little longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she couldn't expose Bertha now, she knew it would be impossible to get her to be exposed later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Camille remained unconscious, a heavy sigh of relief swept over Joshua, Celeste, Barnett, Bertha, and even Hubery and Isabella. It was as if the tension had momentarily lifted from their shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph rushed to Camille's side, shoving Aurora out of the way. "Camille, please don't do this to me! Open your eyes!" He picked her up, his eyes frantic with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Camille didn't respond. No matter how desperately he called her name, she remained still.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face twisted with anguish. He glared at Aurora, fury flaring in his eyes. "This is your fault! If you hadn't been causing this scene, Camille would never have collapsed again. If anything happens to her, I swear to God, I will make you pay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Isabella and the doctor, his voice desperate. "What are you waiting for? Get her into surgery, now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella's gaze flickered with a brief, barely noticeable satisfaction, but she quickly masked it. She grabbed the doctor and hurried out of the room, Adolph close behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora moved to follow, but Joshua stepped in her path. "Get back to the house, now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weight of the situation crashed down on her. As the possibility of exposing Bertha slipped away, a wave of hopelessness overwhelmed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her vision blurred as dizziness hit. An all-consuming despair wrapped itself around her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She threw her head back and laughed&mdash;a wild, broken laugh that echoed through the room, high-pitched and full of madness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You did this to me," she whispered, a bitter edge to her voice. "You all did this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua stumbled back in shock, but his fury quickly rekindled. He kicked Aurora hard, knocking her to the floor, and raised his fist, ready to strike her down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice, Ashley, and Daisy rushed forward, trying to restrain him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having witnessed the entire exchange, Beatrice's heart sank. The more she understood about what had happened to Aurora, the more her sympathy grew. The injustice was suffocating. She couldn't help but think that the Elvador family were beyond redemption.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can you call yourselves parents?" Beatrice's voice trembled with disgust. "You don't care about your own daughter, but you're covering for a wicked adopted child? Have you no heart?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's face contorted with rage. He swung his arm dismissively, sending the three women sprawling back. "Mind your own business, old woman. My family's matters are none of your concern. Get out of my way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned back to Aurora, the threat of violence clear in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste, Barnett, and Hubery watched silently, not one of them lifting a finger to stop Joshua from hurting her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Joshua's fist came down, Aurora's anger flared like wildfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a quick, fluid motion, she pulled a small knife from her pocket and, without hesitation, plunged it deep into his arm. Blood spurted from the wound, staining her hands and the blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of rage exploded inside Aurora. The memories of five years of suffering&mdash;unfairness, misunderstanding, pain&mdash;flooded her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't care about clearing my name anymore," she spat, her voice raw with fury. "I want you all to pay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a savage cry, she yanked the knife out and drove it forward again, this time aiming for his heart.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="64.html">« Prev</a><a href="66.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
