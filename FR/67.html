Her voice trembled as she called out, "Come down. It's dangerous up there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley quickly followed, shouting, "Sweetheart, there's no mountain too high to climb. Don't do something foolish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears streamed down Daisy's face as she pleaded, "Aurora, no matter what you're facing, I'm here for you. Please, come back down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked at them. Her crazed expression finally softened, and a gentle smile appeared on her tear-streaked face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gazed at Daisy with a serious, almost bittersweet look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daisy, the luckiest thing in my life was meeting you. If it weren't for you, I would've died my first year back at the Elvador Villa. You gave me a second chance at life. Every time the Elvador family mistreated me, you were there to protect me. You were the only warmth I felt at that house. I've dreamed countless times that when I finally succeed, I'd repay you. I'd buy you a big house, send Lily to college, and help her study abroad... but..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice faltered as she choked back tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But all my dreams have been shattered. My own family, my parents and brother, framed me. They sent me to prison, ruined my chance to go to Vertar University, and left me broken. I'm a wreck now, and I can't repay you anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy couldn't hold back her tears as she thought about all the abuse Aurora had endured at the Elvador Villa over the past three years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everything will be okay," she whispered, her voice cracking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora shook her head, her eyes full of despair. "No, it won't. The Elvador family will never let me go. I can't go back to prison. The pain there was unbearable. I can't take it anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy sobbed uncontrollably. Even Beatrice and Ashley had tears in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What had happened to this innocent girl? How had she been so cruelly tortured?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice fought to suppress her anger. With a face full of love, she spoke softly, "Sweetheart, they may not want you, but I do. Come with me, and I'll protect you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora shook her head. This kind-hearted woman deserved better than to be dragged into the Elvador family's mess because of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley hurried to add, "Honey, hardships are temporary. Everything will get better. Trust me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it won't. Aurora knew it in her bones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her leg would always be crippled. Her missing kidney would never grow back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had worked so hard to get into Vertar University, but now that dream was gone forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her life had been destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Beatrice, her voice barely a whisper. "Thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she looked at Ashley. She remembered the first time she met Ashley, at the train station. It was Ashley who had stood up to protect her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had called her "Mom".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley had held her like a mother would, protective and comforting, even if just for a fleeting moment. That moment had stayed with her, forever etched in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They said that a mother's greatest treasure was her child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So why wasn't she that treasure?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stared at Ashley, her gaze full of sincerity, just as it had been when she first saw her. "Mom, thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The word "mom" wasn't one she used lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once she called someone that, her heart was fully given.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eight years ago, when she first saw Celeste, her eyes had filled with tears as she called her "Mom".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cherished that role more than anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, it had been nothing more than a pipe dream. Her so-called "mother" hadn't cared for her, hadn't even seen her as a daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving prison, she had only called Celeste "Mrs. Elvador".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, calling Ashley "Mom", Aurora felt her heart break. Her tears began to fall uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's body stiffened, her heart aching. For a moment, the yearning tone in Aurora's voice made her believe Aurora was calling out to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when she looked at Aurora, there wasn't a single glance from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, I'm your mother. Why would you call a stranger 'mom' and not me? Do you really hate me that much?" Celeste's heart whispered, a pang of regret and pain running through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of losing Aurora's love was almost unbearable. It hurt more than being stabbed in the stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's tears flowed freely. "I'm so tired. I don't want to fight anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice's heart raced as she took a few unsteady steps forward, her voice filled with urgency and pleading she had never shown before. "Sweetheart, please don't do this. If you jump, my heart will break. You're still so young. There's so much more to live for, so many beautiful things waiting for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley, desperate and helpless, called out, "Don't cry over people who don't deserve it. Let me be your mom. You're my daughter now, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, please, come back inside," Beatrice begged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked at them, her eyes a mixture of hopelessness and a strange sense of relief. "I know you care, but I'm so tired. The world has been cruel to me. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't escape the pain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice clenched her teeth. "Sweetheart, I swear, if you come down, I won't let anyone hurt you anymore. I'll help you get justice. I'll make sure those who wronged you pay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora gave a sad, empty smile. "Justice? What justice? There's no such thing in this world. They've already ruined me. Even if they're punished, my life can never go back to what it was. I can never repay you for all your kindness. I'm so sorry..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she closed her eyes, her body tilting backward like a kite with its string cut, falling into the abyss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" Beatrice, Ashley, and Daisy screamed in despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that split second, Hubery dashed forward, grabbing Aurora's waist and pulling her back from the edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once she was back in the room, Aurora had already passed out, her body limp and lifeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice, Ashley, and Daisy quickly gathered around her, holding her close, their hands trembling as they tried to comfort her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's hands shook uncontrollably as he held her, afraid that if he loosened his grip, she would slip away forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until he had her in his arms that he realized just how frail she had become. She was so light, it felt like she could break with the slightest touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart ached as he recalled her desperate words. Hot tears fell from his eyes, dripping onto her bloodstained and tear-streaked face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett stood frozen, still in shock from the moment Aurora had so coldly prepared to die. That image was burned into his mind, and he was too stunned to react. His eyes were blank, as if his soul had been stripped away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste cried out, crawling desperately toward Aurora. "Aurora, my daughter..." Her voice was full of regret and sorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy saw this and, with fury in her eyes, stepped in front of Aurora, blocking Celeste's path. She shouted, "Stop with the fake tears! Look at what your family has done to her! You're not her mother! You and the entire Elvador family don't deserve her! Stay away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she shoved Celeste's hand aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste stumbled back and collapsed to the floor, tears streaming down her face uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the sound of hurried footsteps echoed outside the door, and a second later, Bertha and Isabella, accompanied by police officers, barged in.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="66.html">« Prev</a><a href="68.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
