He was willing to atone for his actions, provided she granted him the opportunity to make amends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he refrained. He feared that his approach might only evoke her disdain and rejection once more, widening the gap between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he could </span><span>do </span><span>was to remain in the background, watching her from afar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the night intensified, Aurora finally rose, her movements slow and labored, each step dragging her weary body closer to the Elvador Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery abruptly snapped out of his reverie and began to follow her from a distance...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora didn't head back to Elvador Villa until it was completely dark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she approached, she noticed Daisy standing anxiously by the villa gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing Aurora's return, Daisy's worried expression vanished instantly, replaced by a smile as she greeted her warmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Elvador, you're back at last," Daisy said, scrutinizing Aurora with concern. When she noticed the bandage on Aurora's forehead and her pallor, a hint of pity flickered in her eyes. "Ms. Elvador, what happened to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora shook her head slightly. "It's nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy still seemed uncertain. "Are you sure you're alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes." she nodded faintly, taking a deep breath to quell the bitterness in her heart, striving to maintain a steady voice. "Daisy, how is Lily?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy's face immediately brightened with a smile filled with relief and gratitude. "Thanks to Mr. Elvador's intervention, Lily won't be expelled from school."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, she sighed. "If it weren't for Mr. Elvador's help, I wouldn't know what to do. Ms. Elvador, actually, Mr. Elvador is a very good person. If you can resolve the misunderstanding between you, he will undoubtedly be a wonderful brother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora remained silent, her lips curling into a faint, barely perceptible sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Daisy's grateful expression towards Barnett, she felt a wave of sorrow emanating from the depths of her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How</span><span> ironic</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>S</span><span>omeone like Barnett could cause harm and still elicit gratitude from his victims.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She refrained from inquiring about what had transpired at Lily's school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her, it mattered little what had occurred; it was sufficient to know that Barnett was the perpetrator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Barnett </span><span>wanted</span><span>, he could devise countless ways to inflict pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he had used Lily to manipulate her; next time, it might be Daisy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to leave and never return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, she could not abandon Daisy and Lily to Barnett's madness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora forced a smile and said to Daisy, "I'm glad Lily is alright."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she dragged her steps towards the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon entering, she witnessed the Elvador family of four sitting happily around the dining table, indulging in a hearty meal together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The table was laden with an array of sumptuous dishes, and the four of them were engaged in laughter and conversation, their faces radiating happiness and warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, her arrival disrupted this harmonious scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett placed his fork down with a clang, his face contorted in an unmistakable expression of disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a hint of concern, he sneered. "So, you've finally decided to grace us with your presence. I was beginning to think you'd run away for good this time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's brows furrowed, and she shot Barnett a glare filled with reproach. "Barnett, how dare you speak to your sister in such a manner?" She snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, turning to Aurora, she forced a gentle smile and waved her over. "Aurora, please ignore your brother. Come and join us for dinner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora politely declined, her voice tinged with a hint of weariness. "No, thank you. You all go ahead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The truth was, she had no desire to face this family gathering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's smile faltered, but she persisted. "You must eat something, Aurora. It's not healthy to skip dinner. At least have a bite or two."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scanning the nearly empty table, Aurora sneered. "I'm afraid I'm not accustomed to eating leftovers," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words cut through the tension like a knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's face froze, the smile vanishing in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The light and pleasant atmosphere was now thick with tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's brows furrowed, and he looked at Aurora with clear dissatisfaction, his fatherly authority radiating from every pore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the awkward silence that had fallen over the table, Bertha quickly laid down her utensils and fixed Aurora with a look of</span><span> fake</span><span> concern. "Aurora, we waited for you for so long. When you didn't come, we assumed you'd eaten out. We've only just begun, so please don't be upset. Come and sit down with us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste seized the opportunity to chime in, her voice eager to smooth over the tension. "Yes, Aurora. Please, at least have a little something. Everything tonight is your favorite."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Barnett couldn't resist another dig. He slammed his fork down on the table and narrowed his eyes at Aurora. "Aurora, we were all worried about you. We didn't blame you for being late, so don't be ungrateful. Stop being so unreasonable. If you want to eat, sit down and stop acting like everyone owes you an apology."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's anger flared brighter at the sight of their hypocritical faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All she wanted was a moment of peace and solitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She just didn't understand why it was so hard to be alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wondered why they couldn't just leave her alone and pretend she was invisible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her calm and tolerant demeanor was met with disdain and misunderstanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they wanted a farce, she would give them one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath to steady herself, Aurora pointed at the scraps on the table. "There are six dishes and one soup here, and they're nearly all gone. Bertha, tell me, is this what you call 'just to begin?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha's expression grew rigid, her mouth opening and closing like a fish out of water as she struggled to find words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora turned her gaze to Celeste next, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "The noble Mrs. Celeste Elvador, how do you propose I eat now? By licking the plates clean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste wanted to say something, but she was cut off by Aurora's sharp retort. "You said it's all my favorite food. Well, then tell me, what exactly do I like to eat?" Aurora challenged, her eyes boring into Celeste's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the ensuing silence, Celeste avoided eye contact, unable to meet Aurora's gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't answer, can you?" Aurora said, her voice tinged with bitterness. "Well, let me enlighten you. I'm not particular about food. I'll eat anything that fills my stomach, except for what I'm allergic to. But apparently, that's too much to ask in this house."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unfortunately, out of the six dishes on the table, I'm allergic to three of them. I'm allergic to seafood, so I can't eat hairy crabs or prawns. I'm also allergic to pineapple, which means I can't eat pineapple chicken as well," she added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's face turned red as she was hit with a barrage of questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it didn't end there. Aurora turned her sights on Barnett next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You said your parents cared about me? Is this what you call caring? Serving me food that I'm allergic to and claiming it's my favorite? Do you want this kind of caring?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's face turned pale instantly. He never expected Aurora to embarrass the whole family with just a casual remark meant to ease the atmosphere by his mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to get angry, but what Aurora said was true. A surge of frustration welled up in his chest, stuck between rising and falling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua trembled with anger as he listened to Aurora's words. His facial muscles distorted in rage, and he slammed the fork in his hand onto the dining table with a loud bang, causing the utensils on the table to shake slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You ungrateful daughter, how dare you!" He stared at her with wide, angry eyes. "Your mother and I gave birth to you, and now we're your enemies?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked at Joshua's furious expression and said, "Did I ask you to give birth to me? If giving birth to me is just to bring me suffering, I'd prefer if you hadn't!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="21.html">« Prev</a><a href="23.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
