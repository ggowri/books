"Who is it?" she called out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, Isabella's voice rang from the other side. "It's me. You're the one who called earlier, saying that bitch Aurora was here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia's racing heart finally calmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly opened the door to find Isabella, Frank, and Brandon standing outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them filed into the room, immediately spotting Aurora lying on the floor like a corpse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Isabella laid eyes on </span><span>Aurora,</span><span> an endless wave of hatred surged within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't wait to charge forward, her eyes blazing with murderous intent. Without a second thought, she swung her foot and kicked hard at Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You fucking bitch," she snarled, "you've finally gotten what you deserve! You killed my daughter, and now you'll pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her vicious kick landed squarely on Aurora's lower back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surgical incision near her kidney was already fragile, and under the brutal impact, it split open. Blood gushed like a fountain, instantly staining the floor beneath her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp, searing pain jolted Aurora back to consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body convulsed, massive beads of sweat rolling down her forehead, her face pale as paper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As her vision cleared, she saw Isabella's face twisted with rage, looking like she wanted to eat her alive. Frank stood off to the side, arms crossed, glaring down at her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A young man she didn't recognize was there too, his eyes filled with pure malice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clicked his tongue, smirking. "Well, would you look at that. The real </span><span>Elvador</span><span> heiress isn't half bad. She's a mess right now, like a stray dog, but that face is something else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rubbed his hands together, moving closer to Aurora. "It'd be such a waste to just let her die. Maybe I'll have some fun with her first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella and Frank didn't object to their son's suggestion. They were eager to see Aurora suffer the ultimate humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella leaned in close to Brandon, her voice low and menacing. "Take it slow, Brandon. Don't rush this. What she did to your sister, we'll make her pay a hundred times over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon smirked confidently. "Don't worry. I'm a pro at handling women. Back when I was overseas, I had my way with plenty of foreign girls. I've got more tricks up my sleeve than you can imagine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia clutched her phone, practically vibrating with excitement. "Go on! Show her what happens when someone crosses us," she urged, her voice dripping with malice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon reached out to grab Aurora but was stopped by Hubery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No," Hubery declared firmly, "She's mine. You're not to touch her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words ignited Brandon's rage. In an instant, he lashed out, delivering a bone-crushing slap that sent Hubery crashing to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell </span><span>are you</span><span> trying to interfere with my business?" Brandon snarled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella let out a cold laugh. "What a loser. A big-shot lawyer who can't even protect himself, now reduced to a helpless cripple. I bet you just wiped your ass with those law books you studied," she mocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room erupted in cruel, uninhibited laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's face turned ashen and fury, but he could not </span><span>move</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only watch helplessly as Brandon dragged Aurora into the bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Throwing Aurora onto the bed, Brandon pinned her down, his intentions violent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora fought desperately, each movement sending waves of excruciating pain through her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hand frantically searched the nightstand, finally closing around a lamp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, she swung the lamp with all her might, smashing it into Brandon's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon howled in pain. Blood trickled down his forehead, staining his face and giving him a demonic look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Consumed by rage, he straddled Aurora and started slapping her repeatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's face quickly swelled with bruises, blood dripping from her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella and Frank heard their son's agonized screams and rushed into the room. The sight that greeted them was their son, covered in blood. Eyes blazing with fury, they were about to join Brandon in punishing Aurora when a knock interrupted them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella's face darkened. "Who the hell is bothering us now?" she shouted toward the door. But the only response was more urgent knocking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank frowned, whispering, "Could it be Julian's people?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia panicked, her voice trembling. "That's impossible. How could they have found us so fast?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The knocking grew louder and more insistent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Open the door. Open up right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sound of the voice, everyone in the room </span><span>shook </span><span>with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's Ethan, Julian's right-hand man!" someone </span><span>yell</span><span>ed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic erupted. "What are we going to do? We've been discovered!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay calm," another voice urged. "As long as we don't open the door, they can't get in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if he calls the cops?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grab knives from the kitchen. If they try to come in, we'll fight back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella, Frank, and Cynthia each armed themselves with kitchen knives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery managed to wheel himself to the kitchen and grabbed a rolling pin, ready to defend </span><span>himself</span><span> against the unexpected intruders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four of them stared intently at the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon was still pinning Aurora down, violently tearing at her clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bitch," he snarled, "Even if I die, I'm </span><span>gonna</span><span> </span><span>take you</span><span> first. Julian's woman </span><span>must be amazing</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door shook violently under repeated kicks until, finally, a thunderous crash broke it open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel, Ethan, Darren, Samuel, and Lily burst into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia and Isabella's eyes went wide with shock&mdash;they never expected so many people to burst in like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing things were spiraling out of control, they grabbed their knives and charged forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell!" someone shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily stormed straight at Hubery, fury blazing in her eyes. "Where's Aurora?" she demanded, grabbing him so fiercely he started to shake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery sat frozen in his wheelchair, staring at Lily's overwhelming rage. "I... I don't know," he stammered, his eyes darting everywhere but at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hauled him up by his collar until they were eye to eye. "Cut the crap!" Lily snarled. "Tell me now, or you'll wish you were dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery gasped for air, his face turning beet red, but he stubbornly kept his mouth shut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily tossed him aside and scanned the room with a fierce gaze. Her eyes landed on the closed bedroom door.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="189.html">« Prev</a><a href="191.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
