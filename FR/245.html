"Sir, today's my friend's wedding, and I'm running out of time to get there. Could you please </span><span>just </span><span>take me to Celestia Palace? I promise I'll pay you for the trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's suspicion was confirmed by her words. Now he could tell she was definitely Aurora's friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a word, he started the engine, the car humming to life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily let out a relieved breath.</span><br><span>This guy seems tough to deal with, but he's actually pretty reasonable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you," she said softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan hit her with that smooth talk. "So, how exactly are you going to thank me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?" Lily blinked, caught off guard. She'd expected a polite "you're</span><span> welcome</span><span>," not a direct challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, sir, </span><span>what do you want</span><span>?" she asked cautiously, testing the waters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I haven't decided yet," Ethan replied, his voice slow and deliberate. "How about you add me on WhatsApp, and I'll let you know when I figure it out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily hesitated, her fingers tightening around her phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't keen on adding strangers to her WhatsApp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her contact list was a small, trusted circle, like her mom, Aurora, and a handful of professors and colleagues.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone else? She kept them at arm's length.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the matter? Not willing?" Ethan glanced at her, his eyes cool and piercing, mirroring the detached demeanor of his boss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nah, it's not that. I'm down," Lily said after her brain caught up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For real though, without his ride, she would've missed Aurora's whole wedding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she said yes, Ethan felt his chest do this weird happy thing, but he couldn't figure out why the hell he was so hyped about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't the type to go out of his way for others. If it had been anyone else, he'd have sent them packing. Rain or not, it wouldn't have made a difference to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Lily stirred something in him from the moment he saw her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was pretty, sure, but not in a breathtaking, show-stopping way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the years, working alongside Julian, he'd met countless beauties, including top-tier actresses during business dealings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet none had ever sparked this feeling. He impulsively wanted her contact to keep her within reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is this what they call love at first sight?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan didn't dwell on it. He wasn't one to overthink. He trusted his instincts, and they were telling him to hold on to this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black Maybach sliced through the rain like an arrow, speeding toward Celestia Palace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they pulled up, Lily tried to dash out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold up," Ethan stopped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily turned, puzzled, her white T-shirt and ponytail giving her a fresh, youthful glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a second, Ethan forgot how to breathe, but he played it off smooth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's pouring out there. You'll get soaked without an umbrella."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then h</span><span>e handed her </span><span>a</span><span> black umbrella.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The simple gesture froze them both.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, the rain drummed against the car. Inside, their eyes locked as he passed her the umbrella.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, a shared memory flickered through their minds, vivid yet elusive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's eyes widened, her heart skipping a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What was that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt certain she'd lived this moment before, but when she tried to grasp it, her mind went blank, the memory slipping away like mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan felt it too, that nagging sense of familiarity washing over him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What is this feeling?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a deep breath, shaking off the daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing Lily still lost in thought, he opened his umbrella and stepped out, circling to the passenger side to open her door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, I'll walk you in," he said, his voice steady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily looked up at him. The man standing before her was tall and lean, his tailored suit accentuating his broad shoulders and long legs. His gaze, earnest and focused, sent her pulse racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lowered her eyes, a flush creeping up her cheeks.</span><br><span>Is this because I've never dated?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just o</span><span>ne look at a handsome stranger, and I'm already smitten?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>S</span><span>he scolded herself for having a crush on a stranger</span><span> so fast</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was time, she decided, to make room for love amidst her research, to let herself breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a shy smile, she said, "Thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Together, they walked under the umbrella, stepping into the hotel's grand entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once inside, they parted ways.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan paused, turning to watch Lily's retreating figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how many times he looked, she felt achingly familiar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He exhaled deeply.</span><br><span>Today's Mr. Hawke's wedding. I need to focus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There'll be time to find her after the wedding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the bridal suite, Daisy grabbed Lily's arm, her voice thick with worry. "Lily, you're cutting it close! Aurora's wedding starts in less than half an hour, and you're her bridesmaid!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I got held up at the Institute with an urgent project," Lily explained, catching her breath. "That's why I'm late."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, no time to waste. Let's get you into your dress," Daisy said, handing her the bridesmaid gown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily quickly changed. Just as she finished, a man sashayed in, his vibrant skirt swishing and his demeanor exuding flair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You must be Miss Lily?" he said, eyeing her with practiced precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily nodded, curious. "And you are?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm Simon Russell, the wedding's lead stylist," he declared. "No time to dawdle. Let's get you made up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon was Putnam's premier stylist, renowned across Peloland for his artistry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just fifteen minutes, he transformed Lily's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared into the mirror, barely recognizing herself. The makeup had elevated her from quietly pretty to radiant, a version of herself she'd never seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All her life, she'd never bothered with cosmetics.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In school, she'd been consumed by studies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the Institute, research had claimed her focus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today marked her first time wearing makeup, and she marveled at how stunning she could look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, let's go," Lily said, standing up and heading with Daisy toward the grand hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as she stepped out, distracted and rushed, she collided headfirst with a tall, solid figure.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="244.html">« Prev</a><a href="246.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
