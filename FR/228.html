Her past life had been a wretched tapestry of misery, and her death was steeped in bitter resentment. That unyielding fury had forged her spirit into a blazing force.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she could harness that raw mental energy, she might invent a device to capture the very essence of human willpower. Such a breakthrough could revolutionize military prowess, medical miracles, education, and even gaming.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the military, it could birth futuristic mechs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In gaming, it could usher in fully immersive holographic worlds, where players stepped into dreams made real.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the IntelliBrain finally emerged, it promised to shatter the firmament of ordinary existence, catapulting the lives of common people into a maelstrom of unprecedented change.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peloland's technology would surge ahead, leaving the world in its dust for at least a century.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had once shared this wild vision with her mentor, a grizzled academic whose eyes had glistened with tears of awe. </span><br><span>"Aurora, if you can make this real, I'll back you with everything I've got. Everything."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had woven hints of her grand theory into her thesis, never imagining the storm it would unleash. Her words had caught the eye of Aconoma, a nation that moved swiftly to claim her brilliance as its own.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Aurora had shut them down cold. Undeterred, the government pivoted, wooing her parents with promises of wealth and prestige.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet no matter how dazzling the offers, the Barron family remained unmoved.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Word of the ordeal reached the highest echelons of power in Peloland, and the government took notice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The very next day, a stern-faced official visited Aurora, addressing the stunned Benjamin and Laura with brisk efficiency. "We're taking the girl," he said, handing over a slip of paper with a phone number scrawled on it. "If you miss her, call this. But unless it's urgent, don't."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin and Laura stood frozen, their hearts shattering.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their darling daughter was supposed to come home to Putnam after graduation, reuniting their little family in a warm embrace.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, she was being whisked away the moment her cap hit the ground.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They ached with the weight of their loss, but they knew the stakes. Aurora's future, along with Peloland's, hung in the balance. No matter how much it hurt, they couldn't stand in her way.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Swallowing their tears, they returned to Putnam.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment they stepped through the door, a familiar crew descended. Julian, Joe, Oliver, and Dora were filled with energy and laughter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joe, ever the impatient one, barreled in, yelling, "Aurora! Where's my VIP welcome, huh? Get out here and greet me!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver, never one to be outdone, shouted, "Yeah, and your dear Oliver is here too, Aurora! Come on, let's hit the town!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dora rolled her eyes, swatting at them both. "Oh, please. Aurora's a college grad now. She's way too classy to hang with you two clowns. If she's playing with anyone, it's gonna be me, her bestie."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian stood apart, his steady gaze cutting through the noise. He was the calm in their storm, the one who always saw what others missed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes landed on William, who slumped on the couch. His face was shadowed with despair.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian crossed the room in a few strides and asked, "Will, where's Aurora?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William let out a heavy sigh, his shoulders sagging further. "She's not here."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's brow furrowed. "Then where is she?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, what's the deal?" Joe cut in, his voice rising. "Didn't she just graduate? You guys didn't bring her back? Wait, is she off on some epic post-grad adventure?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William lifted his head as his gaze swept over their expectant faces. "None of that."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, come on, man, spit it out already! You're killing us here!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William sighed, "My sister has been taken."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room went still, the words landing like a thunderclap.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's fists clenched at his sides. "Taken? By whom? Are you saying Aurora's been kidnapped?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William shook his head quickly, raising his hands to calm the rising panic. "No, she's not kidnapped. She's too brilliant, okay? The government noticed her. The second she graduated, they swooped in and took her. I think she's doing research."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William exclaimed with regret, "All these years, Aurora's been buried in her books, working herself to the bone. I don't think I've ever seen her just play."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joe, Oliver, and Dora exchanged wide-eyed glances, their shock erupting in a chorus of exclamations.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Holy crap!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my gosh!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, in perfect unison, they screamed, "Aurora's freaking incredible!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had always known Aurora was a genius, destined for greatness. At just nine years old, she had been whisked away by the government to spearhead cutting-edge research! It was the stuff of sci-fi novels, a nine-year-old scientist shaping the future. Their shock quickly melted into giddy pride.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joe threw his head back, laughing. "I've got a scientist bestie. Talk about bragging rights!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver smirked, crossing his arms. "Told you guys. I called it years ago. Aurora's always been a brainiac. Look at her now!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dora clasped her hands, beaming. "Aurora's the best! I'm so proud to be her best friend. I'm gonna strut through Orley like I own the place!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Julian said nothing with his head bowed, lost in thought. After a moment, he turned abruptly, heading for the door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joe blinked, calling after him, "Juli, where are you going?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Home," Julian replied. "To study."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others stared after him, dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian knew Aurora was a prodigy, a star blazing far beyond his reach. For the past four years, he had pushed himself relentlessly, skipping grades, desperate to close the gap between them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, the chasm felt wider than ever.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was a scientist, a national treasure, while he was destined to inherit his family's business, a mere merchant. No matter how grand his empire might grow, he could never be worthy of her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hollow despair he had never known settled in his chest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What if, after all these years, the girl I've waited for falls for someone else? What if, in the hallowed halls of her research institute, she meets someone who matches her brilliance? What could I, a damn businessman, possibly offer to compete? If I can get into MIT, maybe I may narrow the distance between us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time slipped by, days bleeding into years. Eight years passed in a blur, and Aurora vanished from the world like a ghost. Her existence was erased from public view.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even her family hesitated to reach out, unsure of what top-secret work consumed her, fearful of disrupting her mission.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All they knew was that, since her departure, Peloland's technological advancements had soared, rocketing past global rivals at a breathtaking pace.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the seventh year of Aurora's absence, the Barron family was suddenly granted access to holographic technology, with the government's full backing to develop it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Barron family's core business was electronic gaming, and Benjamin couldn't shake the feeling that this breakthrough was tied to Aurora. He threw himself into the project, and after a grueling year of research, the holographic helmet was born, a marvel that sent shockwaves across the globe.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unbeknownst to her family, Aurora had returned to Orley, the city that had once been her crucible of pain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was back to settle old scores with Joshua, Isabella, Frank, and Bertha. They had schemed against her in her past life, orchestrated her brutal beating in prison, and stolen one of her kidneys. Now, it was time for reckoning.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stepped out of a taxi, her heart pounding as she stood before the Elvador Villa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was exactly as she remembered. She drew a deep breath, steadying herself, and pressed the doorbell.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door swung open, revealing a woman nearing sixty, dressed in a maid's uniform. Her face was etched with gentle lines of kindness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of her sent Aurora's carefully guarded emotions spiraling into chaos.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Daisy!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy peered at the young woman before her. Though Aurora was a stranger to her, her innate kindness shone through. She offered a polite smile despite Aurora's unremarkable attire. "Hello, dear," she said. "Who are you looking for?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="227.html">« Prev</a><a href="229.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
