He looked as if he had lost his backbone, exuding a heartbreaking aura of decay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time they had ever seen Adolph in such a pitiful state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always been their pride. He was handsome, elegant, and confident, the young master of the Sherwood family who shone brightly wherever he went.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, as they saw him in such a disheveled state, their hearts ached with unbearable pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lizeth's eyes welled up with tears, trembling with emotion. "Adolph, how have you been holding up in here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wilson, struggling to suppress the pain in his heart, added, "Don't worry, we're going to get you out of here soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Wilson and Lizeth were overwhelmed with concern and heartache at the sight of him, Adolph felt nothing but guilt and anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He avoided their gaze, his eyes flickering nervously, fearing they would bring up the topic of Camille.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a few words of concern, however, Lizeth's tone shifted, her voice tinged with urgency and unease. "Adolph, tell me the truth. Has Camille woken up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph's heart sank, and his breathing became rapid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"N-no, she hasn't," he stammered, lacking conviction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lizeth wasn't convinced. Her eyes narrowed with suspicion. "Are you sure? Adolph, you can't lie to us. We just visited the Hawke Estate, and Julian told us Camille has woken up. Aurora didn&rsquo;t </span><span>pushed</span><span> her down the stairs, she could prove that. Is that true?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph's face turned pale, and panic flickered in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew he couldn't keep the truth hidden much longer, but he still tried to deflect. "Dad, Mom, don't listen to Julian. He's lying to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wilson's expression darkened, his voice stern. "Did you hide Camille?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I didn't," Adolph replied, his first instinct still to protect Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, Bertha had always been gentle, kind, and innocent. No matter what the truth was, he firmly believed she couldn't have been responsible for what happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's why he had repeatedly stopped Aurora from uncovering the truth and even sent Camille abroad to keep the secret buried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Wilson knew his son too well. From Adolph's evasive look and panicked eyes, he could tell he was lying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether you've hidden Camille or not, we will find out soon enough. How long are you going to keep this from us?" Wilson's voice was laced with disappointment and anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph remained </span><span>silent,</span><span> his heart torn with anguish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Camille returned to the country and identified Bertha as the one who had caused her to become a vegetable, not only would Bertha face imprisonment, but he would also lose the courage to face Aurora again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He truly loved Aurora, so much so that even though she had been in prison and was physically disabled, he couldn't stop thinking about her, caring for her, and even wanting to marry and protect her forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew he was being selfish, but love, by its very nature, was selfish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had already spent five years in prison because of his misunderstanding. He couldn't bear to see the innocent and kind Bertha suffer the same. He couldn't handle the guilt of hurting both women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Adolph's stubborn refusal to come clean, Wilson became purple with rage. "Adolph, I'm asking you one last time. Has Camille woken up? I want the truth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice echoed through the small, oppressive space, making everyone's ears ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph closed his eyes, knowing he could no longer hide the truth. If his father decided to investigate, he would quickly uncover Camille's whereabouts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes." Adolph admitted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wilson and Lizeth's hearts sank, a mix of emotions flooding them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they were overjoyed that Camille had woken up, they also felt a growing sense of unease and guilt, realizing that Julian's words might be true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wilson took a deep breath, trying to calm himself. "Does Camille admit that it wasn't Aurora who hurt her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph's face turned pale as the chaotic scene from the hospital that day flashed through his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had been desperate to prove her innocence, her eyes filled with despair and helplessness, but he had ignored her, repeatedly preventing Camille from identifying Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, thinking back, he felt his heart ache, his guilt toward Aurora growing stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it wasn't Aurora," Adolph said slowly, his voice heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then who was it?" Lizeth demanded, her eyes locked on Adolph, her voice filled with anger. "Who pushed Camille down the stairs? If it weren't for her luck, she would have died!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph fell silent again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He and his sister had grown up with Bertha, and he knew her personality well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Aurora hadn't been responsible for what happened five years ago, he was certain Bertha hadn't done it intentionally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was more likely that Bertha had accidentally bumped into Camille, causing her to lose her balance and fall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, Camille was Bertha's best friend. She had no reason to harm her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, it was Camille's own fault for not standing or sitting properly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Aurora? Why had she admitted to something she didn't do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she hadn't confessed, she wouldn't have spent five years in prison, and he wouldn't be burdened with this guilt now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Adolph had forgotten that it wasn't Aurora's confession that had landed her in prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett lied on the stand, Celeste deleted the surveillance footage, and </span><span>Hubery</span><span> pulled strings as the defense lawyer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph himself had never given Aurora a chance to explain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the people closest to her who had pushed her into the abyss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now he tried to blame Aurora for not proving her innocence in the first place. He totally forgot that Aurora had no evidence to prove her innocence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just tell us!" Lizeth </span><span>shouted,</span><span> her voice filled with desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph kept his lips tightly sealed, refusing to reveal the name, which only made Wilson and Lizeth even more furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camille was their youngest daughter, doted on since childhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the heiress of Sherwood Group, she had everything she wanted. She was the little princess cherished by the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after becoming a vegetable, she had become unrecognizable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As parents, seeing their beloved daughter in such a state, how could they not feel heartbroken?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's imprisonment hadn't been enough to ease their hatred, they had hired people to torment her in prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they were being told they had taken revenge on the wrong person, and their own son was still protecting the real culprit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wilson's face turned livid with rage. He thrust his hand through the iron bars, grabbing Adolph's collar tightly, his eyes blazing with fury. "Tell me, who did that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wilson's anger boiled over as he thought of his daughter lying in bed for five years, her body covered in bedsores despite the nurses' care, her bones protruding through her skin, looking like a corpse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his hand and slapped Adolph several times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You ungrateful brat! Do you even care about your sister?" Wilson roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know how much your mother and I have suffered trying to get you out of here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Julian has given us one day. If we don't give him a satisfactory answer, the Sherwood family will go bankrupt!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you're still hiding the truth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lizeth, tears streaming down her face, pleaded, "Adolph, if you won't tell us, at least tell me where Camille is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph, his face bruised and swollen from his father's blows, tears in his eyes, finally admitted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was deep and husky. "I sent Camille to a manor in </span><span>Madonland</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're shameless!" Wilson shoved Adolph away. "Camille is your own sister! She was in a vegetative state for five years, and as soon as she woke up, you sent her abroad? Do you even have a heart? You're a beast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood up abruptly, glaring down at Adolph. "You'd better pray Camille is okay, or I'll never forgive you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, turning to Lizeth, he said, "Let's go. We're bringing Camille home. I want to hear from her myself who dared to harm the daughter of the Sherwood family. They'll pay dearly for this."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Adolph watched his parents leave, despair filled his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bertha, but I swear she didn't do it on purpose."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="136.html">« Prev</a><a href="138.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
