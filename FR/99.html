The monster was just better hidden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon couldn't bear to imagine what Julian, a man approaching thirty who had finally found a woman he cared for, would do now that Judy had tortured her like this. Even worse, Simon feared becoming a target of Julian's rage himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He struggled desperately against his captors, ignoring the scratches and bruises covering his own body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let her go if you want to live!"

I'm catching this homewrecker red-handed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pointed at Aurora with a wild, triumphant look. "Everyone, look at this slut who's been sleeping with my husband!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson's face darkened as he quickly covered her mouth, hissing, "It's my mother's 80th birthday, for God's sake!

"Since when did you become the star of today's celebration?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Judy's body stiffened, and as she slowly turned around, she found Julian behind her.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="98.html">« Prev</a><a href="100.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
