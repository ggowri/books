She had never felt more confident than she did at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint, mocking smile played on her lips as she gazed at him, her eyes full of derision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Adolph met her calm, unwavering gaze, his heart skipped a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, he realized Aurora had changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her entire presence seemed transformed, as if a complete shift had occurred within her, from the inside out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, Aurora would tremble at the sight of him, like a mouse caught in front of a cat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, she didn't just meet his gaze&mdash;she stared him down, her eyes filled with contempt, as though she were looking at a complete failure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood by the bedside, one hand gripping Camille's, as they both shared the same gaunt appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both pale and weak, even the bruises on their necks seemed eerily identical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a brief moment, Adolph actually felt a pang of sympathy, as though he saw Aurora and Camille as kindred spirits&mdash;both victims of this cruel game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear began to creep up on him, dense and suffocating. He didn't dare examine what he was afraid of, or why.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if, once he understood it all, he would be dragged into a point of no return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tore his gaze away from Aurora and pushed down a surge of emotions. He instructed the doctor to check on Camille.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell into an eerie silence, the tension thick in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every eye in the room was focused on Camille, except for Aurora. Her eyes were sharp, unblinking, fixed on Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha stood there, pale and trembling, her body shaking uncontrollably as if she were a bird caught in a trap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why hasn't Camille been killed? Why can't she just die?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her fear wasn't just about the push&mdash;no, it was far worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The things she had said to Joshua all those years ago, every word, Camille had heard it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Camille spoke, everything they had would come crashing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why she'd had to push Camille down the stairs&mdash;to make sure she didn't survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that all eyes were on Camille, Bertha quickly took a step toward the door, planning to leave. She would warn Joshua, and then they could all escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the moment she moved, Aurora's mocking voice stopped her cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where do you think you're going? Don't you want to make sure your best friend is alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha froze, her eyes wide with terror as she looked back at Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's words shifted the room's attention to Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood there, face ashen, eyes darting around in panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery and Barnett also noticed the change, casting puzzled glances at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett, his tone full of concern, asked, "Bertha, what's wrong with you? You look awful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha wrung her hands nervously, her gaze flickering everywhere, stammering, "I&mdash;I suddenly don't feel well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery stepped forward, his voice gentle. "Let me take you to the doctor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was about to lead her away when Aurora's voice rang out again, cold and commanding. "Stop right there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Bertha and Hubery flinched at the sharpness in her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery scowled, ready to argue, but was immediately interrupted by Aurora's icy remark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have a doctor right here. If she needs one, there's no need to leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's words shut him down completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't like her assertiveness, but he couldn't deny she had a point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the doctor finished examining Camille and turned to Adolph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Sherwood, your sister was fortunate. When she was choked, her survival instincts kicked in. The shock to her system jolted her awake. Otherwise, she would have remained unconscious much longer. If the rescue had been any later, she might not have made it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor's explanation was simple enough for everyone to understand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, Camille had woken up because of her body's struggle during the choking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she had been in a vegetative state for five years. Her body had deteriorated, and although she regained consciousness, she was too weak to resist. She had to endure the choking until someone intervened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph exhaled in relief, though a lingering frustration remained. He turned to Aurora, his voice tight with anger. "Aurora, what do you have to say for yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora smiled coldly, "The real question isn't for me, but for Bertha. And by the way, I'm the one who saved Camille. No one wanted her alive more than I did."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy chimed in, "Mr. Sherwood, during the time you were away with the doctor, Ms. Elvador was the one doing everything to save your sister. If you don't believe me, ask them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph glanced at the two men who stood nearby, their faces pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora let out a sharp laugh. "And here you are, still thinking I tried to kill Camille? If I wanted to kill her, I wouldn't have gone to such lengths to save her. It's Bertha who's always been the one hurting Camille. Only you three idiots could be fooled by her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha staggered back, panic-stricken, repeatedly muttering, "It wasn't me! Don't listen to her lies."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's smile was cold. "Still trying to deny it? Whether you did it or not, Camille can tell us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring Bertha's frantic pleas, Aurora walked over to Camille's bedside. She leaned down slightly, her voice soft but filled with concern. "Camille, it's Aurora. Do you remember me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was worried that Camille might have memory loss after so many years in a coma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes locked onto Camille's face, carefully studying every tiny expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Camille's eyes met hers, tears flooded her face, falling like an unstoppable torrent. Her lips trembled, as if she had so much to say, but the words wouldn't come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She opened her mouth several times, but all that escaped were sobs, her pain echoing through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't the behavior of someone who didn't recognize her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if Camille recognized her, why was she crying?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Camille, please, stop crying. Just tell me what happened," Aurora urged, her voice growing desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that she feared Camille's tears&mdash;it was that Adolph, with his short temper, would inevitably misinterpret it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if on cue, Adolph snarled, "Aurora, look at what you've done! You've made Camille cry. How can you still deny it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for a response, Adolph grabbed Aurora's wrist and roughly pushed her aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How long are you going to keep hurting Camille?" he barked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camille, watching her brother's violent treatment of Aurora, broke into an even greater flood of tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph didn't notice the strange look in Camille's eyes. Instead, he tried to comfort her, "Don't be scared, Camille. You can say anything. I'm here. Aurora won't hurt you."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="61.html">« Prev</a><a href="63.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
