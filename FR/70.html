On the contrary, he considered these qualities essential for surviving in such a complex world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, Aurora's words, "You are a good person," actually struck him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint smile tugged at the corner of Julian's lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the young lady had called him a good person, he would continue being one to the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait for me," he said, turning around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora leaned against the railing, her eyes fixed on Julian</span><span>. She</span><span> watch</span><span>ed</span><span> him stride toward the back of the Rolls-Royce, open the trunk, and retrieve something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's gaze fell on the two bottles of red wine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These bottles had originally been prepared for a business meeting concerning the East Suburb project. Now, they were going to be used to please a young lady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed the wine and returned, handing it to the girl. "Drink it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a hint of hesitation, Aurora took the bottle and began drinking directly from it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he watched</span><span> her unreservedly gulp down the wine, Julian's eyes twinkled with a rare trace of amusement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the car, Ethan watched the whole scene, dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was a bottle of Roman&eacute;e-Conti worth over half a million dollars, </span><span>while Aurora</span><span> treated </span><span>it </span><span>like beer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, his gaze shifted to his usually cold-hearted boss, who </span><span>had a faint smile</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never seen his boss show such tenderness toward a woman before. It was truly strange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan quickly grabbed his phone, took a picture of Julian and Aurora standing on the overpass, and sent it to Beatrice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Beatrice almost went crazy with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't just her. Ashley, Daisy, Barnett, Hubery, and Adolph were all frantic over Aurora's sudden disappearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They searched everywhere, their hearts gripped with fear that she might do something rash in a moment of despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after searching for two hours, they still had no </span><span>clues</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when Beatrice was at a loss, Ethan sent over the photo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a weight off her mind</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, as her gaze fell on Aurora, </span><span>who was </span><span>holding the bottle and drinking away her sorrow, her heart tightened again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice's eyes reddened as she muttered, "</span><span>Oh, my. She must be in great pain</span><span>..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Go ahead</span><span>, child. If it helps you forget the pain, even just for a while... then drink."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After calming herself, she quickly dialed Julian's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By this time, Aurora had already finished one bottle. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her pale face was flushed, bringing a little life to her otherwise tired expression. Her head felt heavy, but she still reached for the second bottle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian was about to say something to stop her from drinking so much when his phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reluctantly, he answered it, and immediately, Beatrice's voice came through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Julian, is Aurora with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Aurora?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Aurora and saw that she was already drinking the second bottle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Julian, Aurora is a good girl. I really like her. It's just that she's had such a hard life and suffered so much. You must take good care of her. Once she's done drinking, bring her back to your place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember, </span><span>be nice to her</span><span>. If you do</span><span>n&rsquo;t</span><span>, I'll never forgive you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice's voice grew more agitated, and before long, she was crying with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing his grandmother's teary </span><span>voice</span><span> on the phone, Julian couldn't help but feel a pang of bitterness in his heart. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly comforted her, saying, "Grandma, don't worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Beatrice remained anxious. "Julian, Aurora is in a bad state right now. Be gentle with her, comfort her more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I understand," Julian replied softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, she's been through a lot. </span><span>They broke her heart</span><span>. </span><span>Show her that you care</span><span>, talk to her, </span><span>and </span><span>help her through this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandmother, I'll keep it in mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice kept rattling off instructions, like making hangover soup for Aurora and ensuring she was snug in bed at night. She covered every little detail. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian listened patiently, chiming in now and then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Aurora was completely drunk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She dropped the empty bottle, swaying unsteadily as though she might fall at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian quickly reached out to steady her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora leaned into his support, her body soft, her eyes were blurred, and her gaze showed confusion and bewilderment. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tilting</span><span> her head</span><span>, she</span><span> asked, "Who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian, still holding her steady, quickly ended the phone call. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So, you&rsquo;re drunk.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Aurora seemed not to hear him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a lazy flick of her finger, she wobbled as she pointed at his sharp nose. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slurring her words but dead serious, she said, "Barnett, right? You're Barnett!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice got louder and more upset. "Barnett, I hate you! You're not my brother! Get away! I don't need a brother like you anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she shoved him with all her strength. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Julian, it felt like a kitten's gentle swipe. But for Aurora, the push threw her off balance, and she started to tip backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Julian reached out, wrapping his arm around her waist to steady her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not Barnett," he explained patiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>You&rsquo;re not</span><span>?" Aurora tilted her head in confusion, blinking her eyes several times as she tried to </span><span>see his face clearly</span><span>. "Then you're Hubery. Hubery isn't any better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cheeks puffed up in frustration as she pouted, "I hate you the most. We grew up in the orphanage together, and you promised you'd protect me. But you helped Bertha bully me. You said you'd learn the law and send those who hurt me to jail, but instead, you sent me to jail..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke of the past, her tears began to fall in heavy, heartbreaking drops. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised her fist and waved it in the air. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>You know what?</span><span> </span><span>J</span><span>ust because you said you'd study the law to protect me, I worked so hard to earn money for your college tuition</span><span>.</span><span> I anonymously funded you so </span><span>it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt your ego</span><span>." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I gave you everything I had, but why did you make me take the blame for Bertha?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The night was still, the moonlight spilling across the overpass, casting a silver veil over everything below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's face was streaked with tears, the droplets shimmering with a fragile brilliance under the pale glow of the moon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't cry," Julian said softly, a rare patience in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Don&rsquo;t tell me what to do</span><span>." Aurora hiccupped through her sobs. "</span><span>Enough with your hyp</span><span>ocri</span><span>tic</span><span> words</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shoved him, stumbling a bit but somehow managing to regain her balance. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hand shook as she pointed at him, her voice trembling but packed with emotion. "Hubery, I hate you. I'll never forgive you! You jerk..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A gentle breeze swept through, lifting her hair off her forehead. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian watched her silently, his cold expression softening as he saw her cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until she cried herself out that he moved. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stepping forward, he gently bent down, slipping his arms under her legs and around her back. He lifted her carefully, cradling her in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At just five feet tall, Aurora's small, fragile frame felt delicate in his strong embrace. She seemed so tiny and helpless, stirring a protective instinct deep inside him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her head rested against his broad chest, her hair messily draped across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moonlight washed over them, casting long shadows on the ground as their figures blended into the soft glow of the night.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="69.html">« Prev</a><a href="71.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
