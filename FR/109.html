"Barnett, how could you say such things?</span><span> </span><span>You know </span><span>how sassy </span><span>Aurora</span><span> could be</span><span>. She must have offended someone in prison&mdash;why else would they </span><span>bully her</span><span>?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Her broken leg has nothing to do with us. Why are you blaming your father and me for her suffering? Is Aurora all you care about? Don't we, as your parents, deserve your concern as well?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to contain her emotions any longer, Celeste buried her face in her hands, her shoulders heaving with sobs. Her muffled crying echoed through the ward, making Barnett's heart ache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of his mother's distress nearly broke his resolve. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was about to offer words of comfort, the memory of Aurora's cold, distant gaze flashed through his mind. That look instantly extinguished </span><span>his attempt</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His chest tightened as his voice turned hard and bitter. "Aurora wants nothing to do with us anymore. Isn't that what you wanted?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua, who had been reclining on the hospital bed, struggled to sit up. Pain and anger twisted his </span><span>face</span><span> </span><span>into a grotesque mask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You ungrateful bastard!" Joshua roared. "You dare blame us? Aurora is poison&mdash;she's brought nothing but misery to this family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's eyes blazed with fury. "Shut up! You forced Aurora to take the fall for Bertha. Have you no conscience?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he slammed his fist on the nearby table. The impact sent items flying, scattering across the floor with a thunderous crash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua flinched instinctively but maintained his defiant posture. "Don't forget&mdash;you were the one who testified against Aurora in court. Now you're trying to shift all the blame onto your mother and me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words hit Barnett like a physical blow, making him stagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, he remembered. Those events haunted him like </span><span>ongoing</span><span> </span><span>nightmares, tormenting him day and night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is karma!" Barnett spat through gritted teeth. "</span><span>Your legs were broken because you had it coming!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for himself, he knew his deteriorating health since Aurora's departure was his own punishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua couldn't bear hearing Barnett constantly defend Aurora. To him, she was nothing but worthless trash, undeserving of Barnett's protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out!" Joshua jabbed a trembling finger at his son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett, however, stood like a statue beside the bed, fixing his father with an icy stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua was unable to move with his broken leg, his impotent rage building until his face turned crimson. Veins bulged on his forehead as the pain in his leg intensified, nearly causing him to black out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching his father's suffering, Barnett </span><span>was contended</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the heated confrontation between the two, Celeste pushed through her own pain to intervene. "Barnett, please stop fighting with your father over Aurora.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We were wrong about her. She's an ungrateful kid who abandoned us. While we've been worried sick about her, she's probably been laughing at our expense.</span><span> </span><span>I regret ever giving birth to her. She's been nothing but a curse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste dabbed at her tears, struggling to compose herself. "Barnett, Bertha is returning from Putnam today for Madam Hawke's birthday. Call her now and tell her not to come. With Aurora's vengeful nature, she'll surely try to hurt Bertha."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, call Bertha right away," Joshua agreed, his brow furrowing deeper at the thought of his recovering daughter facing Aurora's wrath. Bertha was still fragile from her surgery the previous year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's heart clenched as he recalled Bertha's pitiful state at the police department. Aurora's methods had been ruthless&mdash;how could she torment Bertha so cruelly?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to tell Celeste about Bertha's arrest but couldn't bear to worry her further. </span><span>So, h</span><span>e </span><span>held his tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long pause, he said, "I understand. </span><span>Have some rest</span><span>. I have matters to attend to."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste wanted to say more, but seeing Barnett's closed expression, she bit back her words and could only sigh helplessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's footsteps were heavy as he left the ward, each step weighted with invisible burdens. His solitary figure cast a long shadow in the corridor's harsh light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could exit the hospital, he </span><span>ran into</span><span> </span><span>Darren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barnett? Shouldn't you be with your parents? Where are you headed at this hour?" Darren asked, stopping him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to see Aurora," Barnett replied wearily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Julian cared deeply for Aurora and wouldn't release Bertha of his own accord. Their only hope was to appeal to Aurora directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren's eyes lit up at the mention of Aurora's name. "Where is she? I'll come with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What for?" Barnett asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren had his own reasons for seeking Aurora. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While organizing files recently, he'd discovered that Aurora had undergone kidney matching tests during her first year back with the Elvador family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been only 15 at the time. Why would she need matching? Who was the intended recipient?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And what had become of her missing kidney?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These questions plagued Darren's mind.</span><span> He needed answers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, he hadn't seen Aurora since she left the hospital, and while he could have questioned the Elvador family, </span><span>what they did to</span><span> Aurora made him reluctant to involve them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sensed he might have stumbled upon a</span><span> huge</span><span> secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maintaining a casual tone, Darren replied, "I just want to tag along. Remember last time when Aurora tried to escape? I helped you bring her back together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tapped his chest confidently. "I'm an expert at tracking people down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett accepted this explanation. "I'm going to beg for her help, not capture her. She's more powerful now and even connected with Julian."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Beg her?" Darren's confusion was evident. "Things must be dire if you're asking Aurora for help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's behind Bertha's arrest. They're claiming Bertha stole </span><span>an </span><span>embroidery worth 20 million dollars. It's absurd&mdash;our family wouldn't even bother with such a sum..." Barnett's voice grew increasingly agitated as he continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren cut him off impatiently. "Alright, let's hurry and find her before she goes to sleep."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The night was serene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the Hawke Estate, soft lamplight spilled through windows onto the garden path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian stood quietly outside Aurora's door, holding a glass of milk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knocked </span><span>at the door </span><span>gently. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the silence, each rap seemed unusually loud. Once, twice, three times&mdash;but no response came from within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>H</span><span>e wondered</span><span> if she was asleep</span><span>, carefully pushing the door open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the gap, he saw Aurora standing before the floor-to-ceiling window, dressed in a white nightgown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Elvador?" he called softly, but she remained motionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Growing concerned and confused, Julian wondered if she was so lost in thought that she hadn't heard him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He entered the room, set the milk on a table, and tried again. "It's late. Drink this milk and get some rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, there was no response. The only sound was the whisper of leaves stirring in the night breeze outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Elvador?" Julian called out again, but all he received in return was silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Doubts swirled in his mind as he gently patted Aurora on her shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Startled by the unexpected contact, Aurora jerked away, spinning around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because she moved too quickly, she lost her balance. Her injured legs buckled beneath her, and she began to fall backward. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian swiftly caught her,</span><span> his</span><span> strong arms wrapping securely around her waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked up at him, startled, her fingers instinctively pressing against his broad chest. </span><span>She looked startled</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a black Bentley glided to a stop outside the estate. Darren and Barnett emerged from the vehicle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking up, they saw Julian holding Aurora close, their intimate embrace framed in the second-floor window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From their angle, it appeared as though the pair were locked in a passionate kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's eyes went wide as rage erupted from deep within him, surging up to his temples.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, have you no shame?" he shouted, pointing accusingly at the window. "Who gave you permission to live with him?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="108.html">« Prev</a><a href="110.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
