It's Ethan Ward!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily, irritated by the sudden restraint, struggled fiercely until she finally broke free from his grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't care..." she mumbled, snatching the bottle of liquor and taking a hard swig.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could even swallow, Ethan reached out, gripping her shoulders firmly. His voice was stern. "Stop drinking! Spit it out and go to sleep!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Lily had no intention of listening. She fought back, wriggling in his grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The struggle between them intensified in the cramped kitchen. Amid the chaos, Lily lost her footing, and her entire body toppled forward, pressing against Ethan and pinning him against the kitchen counter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a fleeting moment, their lips met. The liquor in Lily's mouth spilled into Ethan's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's eyes widened in shock, filled with disbelief. He instinctively swallowed the liquor that had spilled into his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His entire face flushed a deep red in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a jolt, he shoved Lily off him, his fingers trembling as he pointed at her. "You... What the hell are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, he started coughing violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily, startled by his outburst, suddenly looked like she was about to cry. Her eyes filled with tears, her voice hoarse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think I'm disgusting. No one ever likes me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barnett spread rumors at school, telling everyone I was someone's mistress. Now the entire campus calls me a homewrecker and curses me every day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora is kind to me, but she never shares her pain. She just suffers alone, never letting me in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And now, even you despise me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, her tears fell uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan stood frozen, watching her sob with such heartbreaking vulnerability. His chest tightened, leaving him unbearably restless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he opened his mouth to comfort her, Lily suddenly looked up. Her eyes, reddened from crying, were glossy with tears and tinged with a drunken haze. She stared straight at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you know that from the very first moment I saw you, I really, really liked your..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her last word was swallowed up by a hiccup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan felt as if his heart had been struck. It skipped a beat before pounding erratically in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">She liked me from the very first time we met?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So it was love at first sight for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan felt the heat rising to his face. He took a deep breath, trying to steady himself, and spoke softly, "I never said I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, Lily's muffled sobs interrupted him. She cried, "I'm a woman... Why can't you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan was stunned. Completely baffled, he stared at her in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gently patted her head and comforted her, "Stop crying. I'll get you some water. You need to sober up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Lily didn't seem to hear him. Her unfocused gaze lingered on his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, without warning, she reached out, grabbing his throat with surprising strength. Ethan stumbled back, crashing against the kitchen counter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp wave of suffocation hit him as he instinctively tried to push her away, but Lily's grip was firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, she pressed her lips to his throat, biting down lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sudden jolt ran through Ethan's body, an unfamiliar sensation surging from the point of contact and spreading through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sensation was completely unfamiliar, yet utterly intoxicating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Losing his last shred of restraint, Ethan instinctively reversed their positions, flipping her beneath him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's fingers brushed against his neck as Ethan's breathing grew heavy, his chest rising and falling sharply. He clenched his jaw, struggling to maintain the last thread of control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He straightened up, struggling to steady his uneven breathing and a racing heartbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at Lily, sprawled against the counter, her hair in disarray, cheeks flushed with a hue. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quickly, he averted his gaze, afraid that if he looked any longer, he might do something he shouldn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That fleeting moment of intimacy just now had shaken Ethan's defenses to the core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan kept reminding himself over and over.</span><br><span>She's drunk and completely unaware. I can't take advantage of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily looked at him with pitiful eyes and started mumbling again, "Why not with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled up in her eyes as she sobbed.</span><br><span>I have finally found a face that perfectly suits my taste, yet he prefers men over women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily had originally wanted to ask why he couldn't love women and insisted on liking men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with her mind numbed by alcohol, she couldn't express herself clearly and could only keep repeating that Ethan was impotent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a man, those words were undoubtedly a fatal insult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with the best patience, Ethan crumbled under her relentless accusations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His jaw clenched, his voice low. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You haven't even tried. How do you know I can't?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily, completely unaware of how hurtful her words were, stubbornly insisted, "I saw it with my own eyes. You just can't."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan let out a sharp laugh, his anger barely contained. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Saw it with your own eyes? What the hell did you see?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily, startled by his sudden outburst, felt even more upset.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't. You just can't..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan completely lost all sense of reason. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to see for yourself? Fine, I'll make sure you experience it firsthand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he grabbed her roughly, hoisting her over his shoulder and striding toward the bedroom with determined steps. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reaching the bed, he threw her down without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's bathrobe had already become a disheveled mess from the struggle, loosely draped over her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hem of her robe slid up to her upper thighs, exposing a vast expanse of smooth skin, radiating an irresistible allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan narrowed his eyes and leaned over her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fighting against the surge of desire within him, he spoke in a husky voice, "If you beg me, I might let you go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Lily showed no sign of backing down. Instead, she wrapped her arms around his neck, pressing her lips to his throat once more, sucking forcefully. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within moments, a deep mark bloomed on Ethan's skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That single act ignited the desire Ethan had been suppressing for far too long. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His breathing grew heavier, his chest rising and falling with intensity. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, his hand effortlessly tugged her bathrobe open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You asked for it." He pressed her firmly against the bed, his breath fanning over Lily's face, radiating intense heat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lips trailed slowly down Lily's cheek, pressing soft kisses against her earlobe, drawing a quiet moan from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was filled with an air of intimacy as their body temperatures steadily rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their rapid heartbeats echoed through the quiet room. They lost themselves in a night of passion.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="167.html">« Prev</a><a href="169.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
