Can&#x27;t you hear me?&quot; he yelled.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Aurora was lost in a fog, her ears ringing, and she could not hear. She just kept begging for forgiveness.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Adolph moved closer, reaching to lift her off the floor.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But when she saw his hand, she instinctively curled up, covering her head and crying, &quot;Don&#x27;t hit me.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Memories of being brutally beaten in prison flashed through her mind, the relentless darkness and pain causing her to utterly crumble at this moment.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Adolph&#x27;s eyes widened, his hand frozen mid-air. He stared at Aurora&#x27;s hunched figure, a swirl of emotions in his heart.</p><p>For a moment, he saw the old Aurora—the shy, fun-loving girl with eyes like stars.</p><p>He first heard about her from his teacher, who couldn&#x27;t stop praising her.</p><p>&quot;Adolph, your toughest rival in this physics competition is Aurora, a freshman from Orley High. She&#x27;s seriously talented.&quot;</p><p>The sixteen-year-old Adolph, never one to back down, said, &quot;I&#x27;m just as talented as she is.&quot;</p><p>He was used to being top at Herren High, so he brushed her off—until she beat him in the competition, over and over again.</p><p>Driven by a need to compete, he joined contests just to be where she was.</p><p>Years passed, and he couldn&#x27;t tell if he wanted to win or just see her.</p><p>In high school, Aurora always took first place, leaving Adolph in second.</p><p>He still remembered his teacher&#x27;s words: &quot;Aurora is a genius, a talent our country needs for great things.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Upon hearing those words, he was convinced of her greatness.</p><p style="text-align:left;">During the final competition, he inquired whether her relentless participation was an attempt to catch the eye of those in higher positions.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She responded, &quot;No, it&#x27;s because the winner gets money. I&#x27;m merely doing it for the prize money. I want to be a teacher, to educate countless students, and to witness their growth into talented individuals. That&#x27;s how I find my purpose.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You&#x27;re incredibly talented; it&#x27;s a pity you&#x27;re not pursuing scientific research,&quot; he remarked.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She smiled and returned the question. &quot;And what about you?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Me? I have to return and inherit the family business,&quot; he replied.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Aurora echoed, &quot;You&#x27;re so talented; it&#x27;s a pity you&#x27;re not pursuing scientific research as well.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">They exchanged glances and burst into laughter.</p><p style="text-align:left;">At that moment, he was thankful that Aurora&#x27;s dream wasn&#x27;t to become a scientist. Otherwise, even as the heir to the Sherwood Group, he still didn&#x27;t deserve her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He had fiercely opposed his arranged marriage with Bertha. Neither Bertha nor the true heiress retrieved by the Elvador family appealed to him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But then, he saw Aurora at Bertha&#x27;s graduation banquet. He realized that the girl he had always thought about was the true heiress of the Elvador family.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The one engaged to him since birth was Aurora herself.</p><p style="text-align:left;">When he learned of this news, he was ecstatic.</p><p style="text-align:left;">If only things hadn&#x27;t happened the way they did, they could&#x27;ve been happy.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In his memory, the lively, cheerful, and enchanting Aurora had changed.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The woman standing before him no longer bore the trace of her former vibrant spirit.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Adolph&#x27;s emotions flickered in his eyes.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His throat felt choked, as if he wanted to speak but he realized that any words at this moment would fall flat.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Aurora&#x27;s trembling body and frightened eyes stood before him like a sharp blade, piercing straight into the softest part of his heart, cracking the hardness that had once been impenetrable.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You can leave now,&quot; Adolph finally spoke, his voice devoid of its usual coldness and harshness, replaced instead by a barely noticeable hint of fatigue.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He slowly lowered his hand, which was clenched into a fist.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Aurora remained huddled on the ground. A frown creased his brow, and an impulse to hold her in his arms and comfort her surged within him, but this fleeting thought was swiftly quelled.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I said, get out of here!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Aurora, however, couldn&#x27;t hear Adolph&#x27;s words. Her vision was obscured by a mixture of blood and tears, rendering his lips invisible to her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She hastily raised her hand to wipe away the blood and tears streaking her face.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her eyes were wide and fixed on Adolph&#x27;s lips as she struggled to comprehend his message.</p><p style="text-align:left;">At last, he was commanding her to leave.</p><p style="text-align:left;">An inexplicable wave of joy surged through her, a blend of relief, disbelief, and an overwhelming sense of survival after enduring such a trial.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I&#x27;m leaving, I&#x27;m leaving right now,&quot; she whispered, her voice trembling and raspy.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Despite the ache in her knees and forehead, she scrambled to her feet using both hands and feet, driven by desperation.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her injured leg barely held her weight, and she stumbled repeatedly, nearly falling, but her primal survival instinct kept her upright.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Terrified that Adolph might change his mind, she wasted no time and bolted out of the room without hesitation.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Adolph stood there for a long moment, only slowly averting his gaze once the humiliated figure had vanished from his sight.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He sank onto the bed and gently traced the contours of Camille&#x27;s hollowed-out eyebrows and eyes with his fingers. &quot;Camille, will you blame me for letting her go so effortlessly?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">But he had no choice. He could never bring himself to be harsh with her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Camille lay there in silence, unresponsive.</p><p style="text-align:left;">*****</p><p style="text-align:left;">The hospital corridor&#x27;s lighting was piercingly bright.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Aurora had to squint as she stumbled forward.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her body seemed to have lost all sense of direction, bumping into walls and passersby alike, yet she paid no heed to these minor collisions.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The strange glances from those around her were ignored as her mind was focused solely on one thing—escaping Adolph as far as possible.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The fear of him catching up to her again if she slowed down propelled her forward.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In her rush, she failed to notice the person emerging from the nearby consultation room, and she collided with them, losing her balance and falling backward.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In the next instant, a strong hand enveloped her waist, and with a mere gentle tug, she was pulled into an embrace.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Aurora.&quot; The voice from above was familiar but felt different.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She looked up and met Hubery&#x27;s gentle eyes, reflecting her defiance.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was like a jolt; she pushed him away and looked down, ready to leave.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But after a few steps, his big hand caught her wrist, effortlessly keeping her under his control.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="19.html">« Prev</a><a href="21.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
