Kill me and you'll never</span><span> find Aurora's child!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily froze. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">A child.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Aurora's child.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me, where is the child?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing Lily's weakness, Isabella gave a twisted, maniacal grin and burst into laughter. "S</span><span>ee, y</span><span>ou do care about that brat. You want to know where the little bastard is? Then you'd better do as I say. Otherwise, I'll take that secret to the grave. Now, take me to a hospital."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella, gritting her teeth against the pain, barked orders at Lily. She thought that with Aurora's child as leverage, Lily would obey her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Isabella forgot that the Lily standing before her was consumed by hatred. She was a demon that had crawled straight out of hell.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily smiled, a terrifying sight against her blood-streaked face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood up, went to the kitchen, and returned with a bag of salt.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella's face drained of color at the sight of the salt, fear washing over her like a tidal wave. "No! N</span><span>o</span><span>! You'll never find her if you&mdash;"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella screamed in pain before she could finish as Lily expressionlessly poured the salt onto her wounds. "</span><span>Say it.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella wailed, her cries echoing through the room as she writhed in agony on the floor. "I'll tell you! Just please... stop!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily tossed the salt aside. "Spill it!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella said, "If I tell you now, you'll kill me on the spot. You want to see Aurora's child, right? Fine, I can take you there myself."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's gaze bore into Isabella, seeing right through her little game. "I'll give you two choices. First, tell me where Aurora's daughter is right now, and I'll let you go. "Second, we replay the Frank show, but with more... creativity. You can take your secret to the grave for all I care. Once I tell Julian, he'll find Aurora's daughter sooner or later with his resources."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella hesitated, eyes filled with fear and struggle. "You'd really let me go? Aren't you afraid I'll call the cops?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily laughed. "I've killed so many people. The cops are coming for me whether you call them or not."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella had to admit Lily made a good point. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who would give up when life dangled before their eyes? </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However slim, a chance to live was better than certain death. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After weighing her options, Isabella finally revealed the location of Aurora's child. "I've told you. Can you let me go now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's smile was chilling. "You finally did something that pleased me. For that, I'll give you a quick end."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, she plunged the knife into Isabella's heart. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella was horrified. "You... you lied to me..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily blinked, feigning innocence. "I said I'd let you go. I never said I'd keep my word."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll rot in hell..." Isabella breathed, filled with resentment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether I rot or not, I don't know. But you definitely will." Lily yanked the knife out and stabbed again, shredding Isabella's heart to pieces.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella died in agony, her final moments filled with terror and despair. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily glanced at the two corpses on the floor, snorted, and turned to leave. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella and Frank's bodies weren't discovered until the next day, prompting a police investigation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily sped down the road, reaching a secluded village in the countryside. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guided by Isabella's directions, she finally parked in front of a house without a fence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she got out of the car, she was met with a stream of shouting. "You little wretch! How dare you steal your brother's food? You don't deserve to eat! You belong in a pigsty!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following the noise, Lily saw a frail child being thrown out of the house. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The child hit the ground like a rag doll and started crying. "Mommy, I didn't steal his food. He dropped it, and I was just hungry..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moment later, a middle-aged woman stormed out of the house, holding a rolling pin.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was swollen with anger, her eyes full of disdain. "You little </span><span>bitch</span><span>! How dare you talk back? Who knows what kind of parents you came from to be such a disgrace?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t been desperate for a child, I would</span><span>'</span><span>ve thrown you out with the trash!"&nbsp;The woman</span><span>'</span><span>s voice was a venomous hiss as she raised the rolling pin again.&nbsp;"Now you dare steal from my son? You worthless rat!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>rolling</span><span> pin&nbsp;cracked against tiny bones.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The child&mdash;no older than three&mdash;curled into herself like a dying leaf, her sobs raw and broken.&nbsp;"Mommy, please! I</span><span>'</span><span>m sorry! I won</span><span>'</span><span>t eat again, I promise!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her pleas, the woman showed no mercy, striking more viciously.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each thud of the rolling pin was met with the child's heart-wrenching wails. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, streaks of blood seeped through</span><span> her</span><span> tattered clothes, staining them a deep, gut-wrenching red.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's heart clenched as she watched. The child's face was a near-perfect miniature of Aurora's. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression turned icy as she strode forward, snatching the rolling pin from the woman's hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman turned to face Lily, a young woman in a white shirt and jeans, her hair in a high ponytail. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell are you?"&nbsp;the woman spat.&nbsp;"This ain</span><span>'</span><span>t your business!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily</span><span>'</span><span>s grin didn</span><span>'</span><span>t reach her eyes.&nbsp;"Just curious&mdash;is this girl called&nbsp;</span><span>'</span><span>Jen-trash</span><span>'</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the insulting name Isabella had mentioned, given by the woman after she had her son.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman frowned, suspicion flickering in her eyes. "How do you know th</span><span>is</span><span> little bastard's name?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perfect." Lily</span><span>'</span><span>s voice dropped to a glacial whisper.</span><span> </span><span>"Looks like I found the right place."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean?" The woman's confusion turned to shock as a sharp pain shot through her stomach. She looked down to see a knife buried in her abdomen.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sickening sound filled the air as Lily twisted the knife, the blade churning inside her flesh. "You dare to hurt my child. Looks like your precious son is about to grow up without a mother."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="196.html">« Prev</a><a href="198.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
