I have already bandaged Ms. Elvador," said Daisy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, Daisy, please prepare my bedroom for Aurora to stay. Do not accommodate her in the storeroom," he instructed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy hesitated momentarily on the other end of the line, but then replied warmly, "Of course, Mr. Elvador. I'll get it ready right away. Ms. Elvador has indeed had a rough time lately, and it's only fitting that she moves to a more suitable place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett agreed softly and ended the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As her elder brother, no matter how unreasonable Aurora might be, their blood ties remain unbreakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now,</span><span> Aurora would sense his genuine concern for her</span><span>, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could almost </span><span>imagine </span><span>Aurora's surprised and touched expression as she settled into his room, and a warm, comforting feeling filled his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but eagerly anticipate Aurora's reaction upon his return home, even </span><span>thinking</span><span> if Aurora was in a good mood, she might bring him </span><span>lunch </span><span>as </span><span>before</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smile couldn't help but curl at the corners of his mouth, and the gloom that had lingered on his face dispersed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was finally time for noon break, and employees were departing one by one, their footsteps and conversations gradually fading into the hallway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morgan knocked lightly on the door, entered, and placed the documents on the desk. "Mr. Elvador, it's time to go home. Aren't you hungry?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett, with a faint smile playing on his lips, replied, "My sister will bring me lunch later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lucky you, having a sister like that. I don't have such good fortune," Morgan joked before departing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett chuckled happily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time ticked by minute by minute, however, it was almost close to starting work in the afternoon. Employees all came back, but Barnett still hadn't seen Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He worried that perhaps something had happened to her on the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett quickly grabbed his phone and dialed the home number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The phone rang several times before Daisy picked up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett asked anxiously, "Daisy, how long has Aurora been out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy sounded confused and replied, "Mr. Elvador, Ms. Elvador hasn't left the house at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's grip tightened around the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't come to bring him lunch. Once, she had loved bringing him lunch, but now, unexpectedly, she had stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his compromises and efforts to make amends, she remained unforgiving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized with a jolt that all his previous hopes had been mere wishful thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How absurd it seemed now that he had ever been so confident Aurora would readily forgive him and resume her habit of bringing him lunch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy, noticing Barnett's silence stretching on, timidly asked, "Mr. Elvador, do you need to speak with Ms. Elvador about something? Shall I call her over to the phone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett regained his composure and politely declined, "No."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After ending the call, he felt a profound sense of melancholy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Morgan walked in and, unfortunately, brought up the subject. "Mr. Elvador, what delicious meal did Ms. Elvador prepare for you today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he was saying that, he glanced around the office before asking, "Eh? Where's the food?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett stared at him coldly, his gaze as piercing as a winter ice blade, making Morgan's scalp prickle with discomfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing his mistake, Morgan smiled awkwardly and quickly steered the conversation elsewhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Elvador, these files contain the information about the land in the eastern suburbs that you asked me to compile a few days ago. According to reliable sources, the land will be auctioned in half a month."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just leave the files here," Barnett replied curtly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Morgan departed, Barnett gazed vacantly for a moment before turning his attention to the work awaiting him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to current policy, the land in the eastern suburbs was designated for a business district.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Provided the policy remained consistent, acquiring this land represented a promising investment opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, competition was fierce; not only was the Elvador Group interested, but so too was the Sherwood Group, and whispers hinted at involvement from Putnam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha had connections with Putnam, and collaborating on the eastern suburbs project with both families could yield a mutually beneficial outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, one factor remained uncertain&mdash;Putnam's stance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Putnam, the capital of Peloland, housed families whose influence far surpassed both the Elvador and Sherwood Groups.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the </span><span>people from </span><span>Putnam secured the eastern suburbs independently, the Elvador and Sherwood Groups would stand little chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett was troubled by both professional and personal matters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He worked late into the night before exiting the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead of heading home, his upset mood led him to the Golden Age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dim lighting and flickering ambiance on the dance floor cast blurred shadows on the patrons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett entered the bar, made his way to the counter, and found an empty seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his hand to signal the bartender for a potent drink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bartender, noticing his demeanor, swiftly prepared a cocktail and placed it before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett grasped the glass and swallowed its contents in one gulp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fiery liquor scorched his throat, causing his brow to furrow momentarily, but it also provided a temporary outlet for his troubled emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One drink led to another, and soon Barnett was drunk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's temper had hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was no longer the person she had been five years ago. The five years she spent in prison had made her prickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, she had pushed Camille down the stairs, rendering her paraplegic; Barnett felt he was not in the wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Aurora weren't a member of the Elvador family, given the influence of the Sherwood family, she would have been imprisoned for the rest of her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's resentment towards Aurora's ingratitude grew with each passing thought, prompting him to take another deep gulp of the potent liquor, making his body reek even more strongly of alcohol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bartender, sensing the tension, quickly prepared another drink and placed it on the counter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as Barnett was about to reach for it, a large hand beat him to it, snatching the drink away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett spun around, his eyes blazing with fury and impatience, shouting, "What the fuck is your problem?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man ignored his outburst, tilted his head back, and drained the entire glass in one gulp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett shook his head, attempting to regain some clarity, and finally recognized the man as Adolph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Adolph only fueled Barnett's anger further. His breath reeked of alcohol as he pointed a trembling finger at Adolph's nose and cursed, "You left Aurora bloody and beaten, you son of a bitch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Barnett, despite his unsteady gait, raised his fist and swung it towards Adolph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph, unhappy but unwilling to deal with a drunkard, easily sidestepped the disorganized punch by leaning slightly to one side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett swung too hard and missed, stumbling and falling onto the bar counter, causing the drinks on it to spill onto the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With red, angry eyes, Barnett glared at Adolph and prepared to swing his fist again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph, however, grabbed his wrist, forcefully pressing it onto the counter, and said, "If you want to lose your mind, do it at home, not in my bar."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard," Barnett shouted, "you beat Aurora like that and you think you're in the right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph's expression hardened. "Barnett, listen to me very carefully. First of all, I didn't lay a hand on her. Secondly, even if I did, she deserved it. It's what she owes Camille for what she did."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="24.html">« Prev</a><a href="26.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
