Isabella asked softly, locking her gaze onto Joshua.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua, whose face was filled with anger and on the brink of exploding, was stunned by her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Isabella. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her eyes, he saw sincerity and what seemed like an unwavering love for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaking her head helplessly, Isabella sighed, "Come on, haven't you figured it out yet? This whole thing is a trap set by Aurora and the Hawke family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora hates us. She resents Bertha for ruining her life. That's why she forged these documents&mdash;to drive a wedge between us. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can</span><span>'</span><span>t be deceived by this.

That arrogant face of yours makes me sick."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua thought Aurora would be embarrassed and ashamed by his humiliating words, but instead, she was looking at him with pity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes seemed to look at him as though he were a fool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t stand that kind of look, as though he were worthless, something beneath her notice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He came from a poor mountain village, and his family was the poorest in that village.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that small village, anyone could bully him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had had enough of people looking down on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua</span><span>'</span><span>s expression twisted into a snarl. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted, "What</span><span>'</span><span>s with that look?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora sneered, "Joshua, you really are beyond redemption. The evidence is right in front of you, but you refuse to see it, blindly trusting Isabella</span><span>'</span><span>s one-sided story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don</span><span>'</span><span>t believe the information on the document? Your eyes can</span><span>'</span><span>t be that blind, can they? Don</span><span>'</span><span>t you see how Bertha looks nothing like you, but resembles your driver perfectly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she finished, all eyes in the room turned to Frank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank, being just a driver who usually tried to stay out of the spotlight, was rarely noticed by anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, with Aurora's reminder, everyone realized that Bertha's nose and mouth were strikingly similar to Frank</span><span>'</span><span>s.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Isabella who reacted first, quickly saying, "People always say nephews take after their uncles. What's so strange about Bertha looking like her own uncle?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua let out a slow breath, his tension easing&mdash;only to scoff the next second, "Funny how the guilty always think everyone else is just as rotten."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora</span><span>'</span><span>s mocking smile deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since that</span><span>'</span><span>s the case, let</span><span>'</span><span>s do a DNA test."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment those words left her mouth, it felt like a spell had been cast, freezing Isabella, Bertha, and Frank in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora fixed her gaze on Joshua and said, "You're so sure Bertha is your biological daughter, right? Then why don't you take a DNA test with her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, Joshua's hands clenched tightly around the armrests of his wheelchair, turning his knuckles white. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face turned ashen, but he said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What</span><span>'</span><span>s wrong? Are you afraid?" Aurora continued to mock him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or how about we do a test between Bertha and Frank?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's heart sank instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was too confident, so confident that it terrified him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once it was proven that Bertha wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t his daughter, all his actions over the years&mdash;hurting his wife, son, and daughter for Bertha&mdash;would become a joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t that he didn</span><span>'</span><span>t want to do the test; he simply couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t bring himself to do it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right then, Julian finally spoke up, "Dr. Lowell is here.
