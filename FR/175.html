H</span><span>e frowned and</span><span> crouched down in front of her, voice soft but firm. "We've been walking for a while. Your legs must be killing you. Hop on. I'll carry you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those words hit Aurora like a punch to the gut, nearly bringing tears to her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her limp was bad - obvious as hell to anyone with eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But since she got out, her family hadn't asked once if her leg hurt. Never even bothered getting her checked out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her own brother, Barnett, had the balls to mock her on release day, claiming she was putting on an act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the Hawke family ever showed her real care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice hired a masseuse to ease her pain. Ashley cooked her hearty, nutritious meals with love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now Julian, watching her with those worried eyes. Something about that kindness broke her. Her throat got tight, tears threatening to spill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She whispered, "Mr. Hawke, I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cut her off, his tone gentle but leaving no room for argument. "</span><span>Save it.</span><span> Just get on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora hesitated for a second, then leaned forward and climbed onto his broad back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian hoisted her up with ease, starting down the street step by step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His broad back radiated warmth, a safe haven she hadn't known in forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stayed quiet. Aurora breathed in his cologne&mdash;notes of cedar, clean and expensive. That scent melted away her anxiety like magic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tension drained from her body, and her eyes grew heavy. She let them flutter shut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian kept walking, carrying her for what felt like miles. Aurora didn't make a sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt her breathing even out, her body going slack against him as she drifted off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time Daniel rolled up in the car, she was out cold on his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian eased her into the backseat with surgeon-like precision, making sure she was settled just right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora and Daisy piled into Julian's car early, heading for Grand Hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the most luxurious hotel in Orley. Its architecture and interior design were exquisite, dripping with opulence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian turned to Aurora when they pulled up. "You two head to VIP room 101 first. Got a quick meeting with a client here, then I'll catch up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do your thing, Mr. Hawke," Aurora nodded. "We're early anyway. We'll chill in the room till you're done."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They split up, each heading their own way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora and Daisy followed a chipper waiter down a plush-carpeted hallway to Room 101.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment they pushed open the door, their jaws dropped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massive round table dominated the space, its glossy surface gleaming like a mirror under the lights. Fine </span><span>cutlery</span><span> and vibrant flowers adorned it, every detail screaming sophistication.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paintings lined the walls, lending the room an air of cultured elegance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A grand crystal chandelier hung from the ceiling, casting a soft, warm glow that made the place feel like a palace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora and Daisy were like fish out of water in this bougie place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy couldn't stop squirming, totally out of her element.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd worked as a maid at the </span><span>Elvador</span><span> Villa and seen plenty of fancy homes, but a restaurant like this? That was a first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This place is so gorgeous, I'm almost scared to sit down," she admitted with a shy laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora gave her a reassuring smile. "Don't worry, Daisy. Mr. Hawke set this up for us. We can just relax and enjoy it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Real talk? Aurora knew well she'd never set foot in a place this fancy without Julian pulling strings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They perched on the plush seats like nervous birds, waiting for him to show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five minutes later, a sudden commotion erupted outside the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Was it Room 101 or 107 James mentioned?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Definitely 101! James is a big deal now. Straight out of college and already a sales manager at Hawke Group. That's insane."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No kidding! Hawke Group's the top dog in </span><span>Peloland</span><span>. James just arrived in Orley, and he's already a manager. He's really something!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I knew back in high school he was special. Good-looking, talented, the whole package."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Totally. Even the Grand Hotel's VIP room is open for him. His boss must love him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're lucky to be associated with James. No way we'd get in here otherwise, not in a lifetime of work."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door swung open, and a crowd of guys and girls spilled inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men wore sharp suits or stylish casual outfits, exuding confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They sported designer watches, their hair slicked back with shiny gel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The women were dressed in fashionable, revealing outfits, their shoulders bare and faces caked with thick makeup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they entered, an overpowering wave of perfume hit Aurora. There were so many different scents mixed together that it was suffocating. Her head started to spin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stared at them, completely baffled as to why they </span><span>just</span><span> barged into the private room </span><span>Julian</span><span> had reserved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group froze, equally stunned to see Aurora and an older woman already there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a beat, a woman in a red dress broke the silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora? What are you doing here? Last night at the restaurant, we invited you, and you said you were busy. Now you're here before us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the same woman who'd taunted Aurora in the bathroom the night before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A woman in yellow jumped in, her voice thick with scorn. "Oh, she totally wanted to come. She just loves playing hard to get, acting like she's above us. Bet she heard James was throwing a reunion here and couldn't wait to show up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rolled her eyes dramatically at Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other women shot her looks loaded with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guys, though, perked up when they saw her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in high school, Aurora </span><span>was</span><span> the class beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even then, half-starved and worn out, with dull, brittle hair, she'd been striking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her looks were the kind that stopped you in your tracks, impossible to miss in a crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, after months of care, she'd filled out. Her skin glowed, rosy and delicate, and her hair cascaded over her shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wore no jewelry, just light makeup, yet she was breathtaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, you're way prettier than you were in high school," one guy said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pfft, so what? Pretty doesn't change the fact she's an ex-con," another sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, she's a woman. Ex-con, idiot, beggar... It doesn't matter. As long as she's hot, some guy's </span><span>gonna</span><span> want her for a wife, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room erupted in harsh, grating laughter.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="174.html">« Prev</a><a href="176.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
