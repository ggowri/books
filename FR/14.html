How could he be here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett had a raging fire in his eyes. His presence was like a cold snake, coiling tightly around Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked terrified and struggled desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Barnett's strength was astonishing, and he was refusing to let her go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was pale, and he gritted his teeth, asking, "Where are you going at this late hour?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora didn't care what he was saying, and all she wanted was to escape. "Let me go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett was like a wild beast. Ignoring Aurora's struggles and resistance, he dragged her out of the ticket-checking area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's feet left two long marks on the ground. Her bag dropped, and her clothes and loose change were scattered all over the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strength gap between men and women was too great, and she couldn't break free no matter how much she struggled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora felt her body was like a fragile leaf, being swept away by a powerful force, with no ability to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No, I don't want to go back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Once the Elvador family hands me over to Adolph, with his cold-blooded methods, I will die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a desperate situation, Aurora cried for help from the crowd at the ticket-checking gate. "I don't know him. He's a human trafficker. Help!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's heart-rending cries echoed through the empty railway station, immediately attracting the attention of the passengers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most people hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But some warm-hearted people stepped forward to stop Barnett. However, they were stopped in their tracks by Barnett's words. "She's my sister. We fought at home, and she's trying to run away. Are you sure you want to interfere?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The passengers hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett was tall and imposing, wearing a hand-tailored black suit. From head to toe, he exuded an air of superiority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't look like a human trafficker at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not his sister. I'm not." Aurora's voice was tinged with sobs. Her eyes were red, and her tears kept streaming down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, no one came forward to save her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair welled up in Aurora's heart, but she still didn't want to give up on saving herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with a sliver of hope, she'd do anything to escape her suffering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scanning the crowd, her eyes locked with a woman in her fifties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled up, and she cried out, "Mom!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley Anson, hesitating at the ticket gate, changed when she heard Aurora's cry. Hope sparked in Aurora as she pleaded, "Mom, save me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Driven by an unseen force, Ashley rushed to Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing her cries, women all around turned to look. Ashley stood in front of Aurora, pried Barnett's hand away, and shouted, "What are you doing? You're not taking her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett was pushed and staggered. A flash of annoyance crossed his face. "It is our family business. Mind your own business."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley held Aurora tightly in her arms, like a mother hen protecting her chicks, with determination in her eyes. "Family business? All I heard was my daughter crying for help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett didn't want to waste words with Ashley and reached out to grab Aurora from her arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a group of women surrounded Barnett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them said, "You look decent, but you're a human trafficker."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another echoed, "Human traffickers deserve a beating. Beat him. Let's beat him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, the women</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s maternal instincts kicked in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They kicked and hit Barnett, so he couldn't reach Aurora anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, Aurora felt protected by so many people, and she cried even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley gently patted her back. "Don't cry. If you don't want to go with your brother, then don't."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stopped sobbing, looking at Ashley in shock. "You know he's not a human trafficker?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His suit costs at least $100k, and his watch is a Vacheron Constantin, worth millions. No trafficker dresses like that," Ashley replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora glanced at Barnett, who was trapped and unable to break free. "Why?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley stroked her head. "Because you don't want to. Even if he's your brother, he can't control you. Family isn</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>t just blood. If they make you unhappy and only cause pain, they're not your family&mdash;they're shackles. You can let go without guilt. A child truly loved wouldn</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>t be as skinny as you. I bet you've suffered a lot, which is why you want to escape."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's tears burst out like a flood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt the understanding that her family couldn't give her from a strange woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you. Thank you so much." That was all Aurora could say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley gave Aurora a push, and Aurora involuntarily took a few steps forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run. Run as far as you can. Never let those who hurt you find you again," said Ashley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked deeply at Ashley, then sobbed and ran towards the outside of the station.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, she even forgot that one of her legs was broken, and the only thought in her mind was to run.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Barnett could find Sounan Railway Station, he would surely find out Aurora was going to Gelaun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora couldn't go to Gelaun anymore, and she couldn't use her ID card either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had to hide. Whether it was scavenging for trash or begging, even if she had to walk on her two legs, she would go to a place far away from Orley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind her, Aurora could hear Barnett's shouts, but she didn't look back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, she was determined to escape successfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The exit of the railway station was right in front of her, and hope rose in Aurora's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Aurora stepped out of the exit, a large hand holding a handkerchief suddenly covered her mouth and nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could struggle, her mind went blank, and her consciousness gradually faded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vaguely, Aurora seemed to hear a mocking voice. "Barnett, your sister is a handful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go home," said Barnett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Aurora regained consciousness, she was already in the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she opened her eyes, she heard Barnett's cold and sarcastic voice. "Finally decided to wake up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, her heart sank to the bottom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had tried her best to save herself. But after all the efforts, she was still caught by Barnett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made all her previous efforts seem ridiculous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora didn't make a scene or pay attention to Barnett. Instead, she immediately reached for the car door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Do you want to jump out? The door is locked. Don't waste your energy." Barnett's voice rose slightly as if mocking her overconfidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked back at him expressionlessly. "Barnett, do you think it's great that you can control my life?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett remained calm and said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This look of having everything under control was what Aurora hated the most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're capable, watch me every day. Otherwise, if I can escape once, I can escape a second time," said Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's face became gloomy. "I dare you."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="13.html">« Prev</a><a href="15.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
