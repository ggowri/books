Despite her delicate beauty, an aura of power and danger surrounded her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily stared at the pile of ashes, the rage in her heart finally beginning to subside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why had she suddenly attacked </span><span>Hubery</span><span>? It all started an hour ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Friday, and the next two days were a break.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the past month, Daisy had been completely occupied with taking care of Aurora, to the point that she hadn't seen her beloved daughter in weeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy called Lily, and they arranged to meet for dinner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Lily ate a fresh slice of meat, she casually inquired about Aurora's well-being. Of everything, that was what worried her most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy, her face warm with a gentle smile, described in detail how Julian, Beatrice, and Ashley had been looking after Aurora with great care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Lily finally relaxed, reassured that Aurora was being properly cared for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when Daisy began recounting what Daniel had uncovered, Lily's composure was shattered in an instant. Her grip on her fork tightened so much that her knuckles turned white, nearly bending the utensil in half.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Anyone who had ever hurt Aurora would pay. Every single one of them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And just as she was seething, searching for an outlet for her rage, her gaze happened to catch a familiar figure passing by the restaurant in a wheelchair. It was </span><span>Hubery</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, time seemed to freeze. The only thing in Lily's eyes was that man's wretched form, and a thought took root in her mind.</span><br><span>This bastard has to pay!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suppressing her fury, she calmly turned to Daisy and said, "Mom, my professor just messaged me. Something urgent. I have to go back school. Head home early. I'll stay on campus tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a few words of concern, Daisy watched her hurriedly leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily stepped out of the restaurant and quietly followed behind </span><span>Hubery</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they reached a secluded and empty street, she swiftly pulled out a prepared sack and, without hesitation, yanked it over his head. Then, she began her relentless assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery</span><span> struggled frantically inside the sack, his muffled screams of agony echoing through the night. But Lily showed no mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he was too weak to fight back, she dragged his battered body into a dimly lit alleyway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Picking up a large rock, she ruthlessly smashed it against his already broken legs again and again. By the time she was done, </span><span>Hubery</span><span> was a bloodied mess, barely conscious, barely breathing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time everything was finished, it was nearly ten at night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily stood beneath a streetlamp, her shadow stretching long on the pavement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was just about to grab a cab.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, blinding headlights suddenly lit up the road ahead, shining directly on her. She instinctively narrowed her eyes, raising a hand to shield them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, a sleek Porsche pulled up in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door swung open, and a man in his twenties stepped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was undeniably handsome, though an unmistakable air of arrogance and mischief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a smile, he said, "Ms. Walker, waiting for a ride? Are you heading home or back to school? I can give you a lift."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily took a closer look. She knew this man all too well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was Samuel Lowell, the man who had tried to force her to drink with him the first time she met Ethan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, Samuel had been drowning in alcohol, reeking of booze, rambling about being dumped by his girlfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And when the alcohol took over, he started harassing her, demanding she drink with him. When she refused, he doused her with a glass of red wine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, his friends joined in, jeering and getting handsy with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily had already been prepared to smash a bottle over their heads when, unexpectedly, Ethan had appeared out of nowhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Ethan was well-dressed and appeared eager to play the hero, she quickly had a flash of inspiration and put on the guise of a delicate, helpless damsel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan drove her back to school, prompting her calculated decision to return his umbrella.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had thought she would never cross paths with Samuel again. But fate had other plans. Even stepping out of campus for a moment, she somehow managed to run into him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel might not remember her from that drunken night, but his friends certainly did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still harboring resentment from their failed attempt to force her to drink with them, they felt humiliated and sought revenge. Spotting her at the mall, they forcefully dragged her into the men's restroom, intending to teach her a lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, Lily had stabbed them with a knife. Not stopping there, she had dunked their heads into the toilet, making them swallow filthy water. Then, with a mop meant </span><span>for scrubbing the restroom floors, she had beaten them black and blue until they were left wailing in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, she dusted off her hands and strutted out, leaving the men writhing on the floor, groaning in misery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, they somehow managed to track down her school and her name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They threatened her, demanding she show up at the bar and drink with them, or they would ensure she wouldn't be able to survive in </span><span>Orley</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And so, they crossed paths for the third time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside a private room, a luxurious glass table was covered with bottles of alcohol. Samuel and his cronies smirked, pointing at the lineup of drinks. "If you can finish all these 50 bottles, we'll let the past go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought she would be scared that she would give in. They had no idea who they were dealing with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily was a lunatic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment these scumbags tried to threaten her, she had already resolved to make them regret it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Drinking was out of the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before they could even react, she grabbed a bottle and smashed it over their heads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She beat them until their heads were covered in blood. Then, she had forced them at knifepoint to drink every last drop of the alcohol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember, I'm not someone you can mess with."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I can beat you up today, I can kill you tomorrow. Go ahead, report me to the police. I dare you. But be prepared, once I get out, I'll come for your entire family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Lily didn't know at the time was that these men were all the privileged sons of </span><span>Orley's</span><span> elite families, accustomed to doing as they pleased, never facing consequences. This was the first time they had ever been beaten, and by a woman, no less.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the wealthy, nothing was scarier than the thought of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Lily was the one person who wasn't afraid of dying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Getting beaten to a pulp twice and receiving a very real death threat, these three rich young men had gone quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was unclear whether they had a masochistic streak, but the three found themselves both terrified of and in awe of Lily. To them, her fierce and untamed nature was nothing short of breathtaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they spoke of her in private, they unconsciously began referring to her with respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, facing Samuel once again, Lily remained impassive as she pulled out her knife. She spun it effortlessly between her fingers, her voice cold as she asked, "Looking for trouble? Or looking to die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel's body stiffened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Truthfully, his feelings toward Lily were complicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was drawn to her cold, untouchable beauty. He feared her violent, unpredictable nature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the way she fought was undeniably captivating, it was also utterly overwhelming, impossible to withstand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel had never met a woman as bold and extraordinary as Lily. Compared to the women who only flattered him, she was on a completely different level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The idea of conquering her sent a rush of excitement through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forcing a smile, he said, "Ms. Walker, such a great sense of humor. I just saw you standing here alone, might be kind and offer you a ride."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so?" Lily twirled the knife between her fingers even faster, its blade catching the light with a sharp, chilling gleam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel was filled with fear at the sight. A cold shiver ran down his spine. "Y</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>Yes..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's smirk </span><span>deepened,</span><span> her eyes filled with amusement. "What's wrong? Not going to ask me to drink with you this time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel swallowed hard. He didn't dare. He had already witnessed firsthand just how ruthless she could be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was rich, and he had a life of luxury ahead of him. He hadn't had nearly enough fun yet to be willing to risk his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily saw the fear in his eyes and let out a barely perceptible sneer before casually tucking away her knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her put away the knife, Samuel exhaled in relief. "Ms. Walker, where are you headed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily raised a brow, scanning his face as if gauging his sincerity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, she replied flatly, "Fine. Take me back to school."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel hurried to open the car door for her. Just as Lily was about to step in, a black Maybach suddenly screeched to a halt in front of them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door flew open. A man stormed out, closing the distance in just a few strides. Without a word, he yanked Lily behind him. Then, without hesitation, he punched Samuel square in the face.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="131.html">« Prev</a><a href="133.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
