His eyes widened in rage as he shouted, "Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lunged forward, aiming to strike Aurora, his raised hand cutting through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy, sensing the danger, instinctively ran over to block him. "Sir, you can't hit her. If you hurt her, she won't be able to marry Mr. Hawke!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of my way! I'm going to kill this troublemaker today!" Joshua grabbed a potted plant from the coffee table and swung it at Aurora's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, this father had no ounce of affection for his biological daughter, Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every blow was meant to kill her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy stood firmly between Joshua and Aurora, refusing to let him hurt her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's ashtray never stopped smashing into Bertha's head, each strike landing with a sickening thud, causing Bertha's head to bleed profusely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett, panicked, rushed over to grab Aurora. "How long are you going to keep this up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora threw the ashtray with perfect precision, hitting Barnett squarely in the forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, blood poured down his face, and Barnett groaned, clutching his head as he staggered backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood was gushing from Bertha's head as she lay on the ground, clutching her head and wailing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Aurora didn't stop there. Her hatred for Bertha had completely erased any semblance of rational thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With both hands, she slapped Bertha's face over and over, each strike ringing out with a sharp crack. Bertha's cheek swelled rapidly, and blood dripped from her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste rushed forward, crying, "Aurora, stop! Please, stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was already red-eyed, her focus completely consumed by rage. She was deaf to the outside world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For years, she had endured, but nothing she did earned her any genuine love from this family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had had enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, she would end it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First, Bertha would die, and then Joshua would be next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's hands trembled, not from fear, but from pure fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pulled a wallpaper knife from her pocket, raised it high, and aimed it at Bertha's neck, ready to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" Celeste cried, her voice rising in panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her frantic state, she grabbed the bloody ashtray from the ground and with all her strength, swung it at Aurora's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sickening thud, the ashtray hit the back of Aurora's head, causing the wallpaper knife to fall with a clatter. Aurora slowly turned her head and saw Celeste, trembling, quickly dropping the ashtray, looking at her helplessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, I didn't mean to... You wouldn't listen... I had no choice..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's gaze gradually dulled, and she collapsed to the floor, motionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy, frantic with worry, noticed that no one was helping Aurora. Everyone was focused on Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett hurriedly scooped Bertha up and took her upstairs, with Celeste trailing behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not a single person paid attention to Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy watched in sorrow, unable to hold back. She spoke up, "Mr. Elvador, Ms. Elvador is losing a lot of blood. Please, help her..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish, Joshua interrupted, "Daisy, we don't need a senseless maid like you. You're fired&mdash;get out, now." His voice was cold, devoid of any warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears filled Daisy's eyes, but her concern for Aurora still remained. Despite being fired, there were things she had to say. "Mr. Elvador, I don't understand. Ms. Elvador is your biological daughter. Why treat her so cruelly? She didn't grow up with you, but now that she's back, shouldn't she be cherished? Don't you have any heart?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up! My family affairs are none of your business. Leave!" Joshua's voice was filled with anger and finality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy didn't move, her expression firm. "I will leave, but first, I must tend to Ms. Elvador's wounds."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste hadn't been gentle, and she had struck Aurora's fragile head with the sharp edge of the ashtray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blow had left a large gash in the back of her head, blood pouring out and staining the carpet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy was about to grab the medical kit, but before she could, Joshua's men dragged her outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua stood over Aurora's unconscious body, blood pouring from the back of her head, yet there was no hint of guilt or sorrow in his eyes&mdash;only disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kicked her again, his shoe getting stained with blood, and frowned in annoyance. "What a troublemaker, always causing problems."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora lay there, abandoned, left to die on the cold floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the villa, rain had started falling, gradually growing heavier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, it was a light drizzle, but soon it became torrential, soaking Daisy's thin clothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy gripped the iron gate outside the villa with both hands, tears and rain mixing on her face, desperately shouting, "Mr. Joshua Elvador, Mrs. Elvador, please, look at Ms. Elvador&mdash;she's your flesh and blood! Her head is bleeding so badly. If we don't treat it, she could die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was hoarse from shouting, carried away by the wind, but her cries were met with silence from within the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each drop of rain felt like a blow to Daisy's broken heart. Her mind kept replaying the image of Aurora lying motionless in a pool of blood. "Ms. Elvador... why must you suffer so much?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't know how long had passed before Aurora slowly came to, the pain in her head unbearable. Dizziness clouded her vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room before her was cold and dim, the family nowhere to be seen. Only the bloody mess on the floor remained, a grim reminder of the brutal conflict that had just unfolded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her fingers curled into a fist, her hatred burning like a raging fire in her eyes. "You will pay for what you've done to me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pushed her weary body up and stumbled out of the Elvador Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she stepped outside, she saw Daisy, drenched from the rain, and instantly, tears filled her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daisy, I'm sorry. It's all my fault..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy hurried over to Aurora, trembling as she helped her up. "Ms. Elvador, you're finally awake. Let me carry you to the hospital."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora wanted to refuse but saw Daisy squatting down, ready to help her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart warmed at the sight, and she no longer spoke, simply leaning against Daisy's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rain fell in heavy sheets, the pounding of raindrops deafening as Daisy struggled to walk, her steps unsteady on the muddy ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was old, her back not as strong as it used to be, and the weight of Aurora's body made it even harder. With every step, she seemed to expend all her energy, but her grip on Aurora's legs was tight, terrified of dropping her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's eyes filled with tears again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rain ran down Daisy's hair, dripping onto Aurora's hands, cold as ice. But inside, she felt a warmth like never before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The past memories of being ignored and hurt by her family stood in stark contrast to Daisy's fiery care, making Aurora cherish this rare kindness even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy, struggling with each step, finally reached the roadside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frantic, she stretched out her neck, waving her arms desperately at the passing cars, shouting, "Please stop! Someone, stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rain poured into her mouth, choking her, but she didn't dare stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cars zoomed by, splashing water all around them, soaking them both even more, making them look even more pitiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy staggered, almost losing her balance from the force, but she gritted her teeth and mustered all her strength to steady herself. With both hands, she pushed Aurora higher, whispering, "Ms. Elvador, please, just hold on a little longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's consciousness was slipping away, her burning forehead pressed tightly against Daisy's cold neck. Occasionally, she let out soft, pained murmurs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deep chill spread through her body, seeping from her bones, and the world around her became increasingly blurry and unreal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Daisy was on the verge of despair, a black Rolls-Royce slowly came to a stop in front of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The window rolled down, revealing the man's signature cold, sharp eyes, scanning the two of them before settling on Aurora's pale face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy clung to the hope of a lifeline, her eyes filled with desperation. "Sir, please, you have to help us. She's badly injured. If she doesn't get treated soon, she might not make it!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="50.html">« Prev</a><a href="52.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
