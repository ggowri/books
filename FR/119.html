A</span><span>nd a</span><span> plan formed in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as she stayed in the camera's view, the person following her wouldn't risk anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A small, knowing smile tugged at the corners of her mouth. She then turned off into a dark alleyway where there was no camera in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With deliberate slowness, she pulled out her phone, her movements smooth, betraying none of the urgency she felt inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when she spoke, her voice trembled, filled with genuine fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello? Officer, someone's following me... I'm scared, please hurry..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up, she walked back into the shadows, her pace leisurely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she stepped into the alley, she saw the figure emerge, his tall form visible in the dim moonlight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily gave a sly grin as she turned to face him. "Following me all the way here? What's your plan? Did you take a liking to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man seemed stunned, caught off guard by her response. His expression flickered with confusion and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a smile, Lily stepped closer to him, her voice sugary sweet. "There's a hotel up ahead. Why don't we go there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man froze, clearly taken aback, unsure of what to make of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could react, Lily wrapped her arms around his neck, pulling herself closer. Her breath grazed his ear as she whispered, "What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man hesitated for a moment, his instincts warning him, but his desires quickly took over. A lewd grin spread across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't expect you to be this slutty," he said, his voice dripping with arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you like it?" Lily's smile deepened, though her eyes flickered with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I l</span><span>ike </span><span>it..." The man breathed heavily, his hands already reaching for her waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without warning, Lily's knee shot up, slamming into his groin with precise force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man let out a guttural scream, doubling over in agony, clutching himself as he collapsed to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily took a step back, watching him writhe in pain with cold indifference. She didn't even look like she was going to run.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what seemed like forever, the man slowly recovered, fury flashing in his eyes. "You little bitch... I'll make you regret this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lunged at her in a rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily screamed, her voice filled with panic, and sprinted away. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man chased after her, relentlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They ran through the dark streets, finally reaching the entrance to Ethan's apartment complex. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The area was brightly lit, and cameras lined the place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily slowed down, allowing the man to catch up to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go of me! Help! Someone, please help!" she screamed, her voice cutting through the night air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man, furious, sneered, "Now you're screaming for help? It's too late for that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled her toward him with a violent jerk, ripping her shirt open in one swift motion. Her white blouse shredded, leaving her only in her camisole, trembling as she clutched her body in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as it seemed like things couldn't get worse, sirens blared in the distance. The police arrived, rushing in and quickly </span><span>arresting</span><span> </span><span>the man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her head hung low, hidden from view, Lily allowed herself a small, satisfied smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, sunlight filtered through the heavy curtains, landing on Ethan's face with an unforgiving intensity, making his eyes sting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He woke with a pounding headache, as if his skull had been crushed under a sledgehammer. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Groaning, he rubbed his temples, hoping to ease the pressure that felt like a vice around his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his eyes scanned the room, he saw the mess around him, especially on the bed and the floor, where several buttons lay scattered. The morning light seemed to make them shine even brighter, almost mocking him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan frowned, a sinking feeling in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did someone break into my apartment?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his head was still throbbing too much to piece anything together from the night before. His thoughts were a jumbled mess, nothing clear enough to grab onto.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperate for answers, he grabbed his phone and pulled up the security footage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The screen flickered to life, showing the girl from Orley University of Technology, helping him into the apartment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He exhaled in relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that relief quickly turned to confusion when the video shifted to her running out of the room in a panic, her hair wild, her face streaked with tears. She clutched her chest, clearly upset.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's eyes went wide, and he almost choked on his own disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What the hell happened last night?</span><span> </span><span>Did </span><span>he</span><span>... did </span><span>he</span><span> </span><span>do something stupid?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook the thought off, refusing to believe it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the video was there, and </span><span>that was the truth</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew he needed to find her and get to the bottom of this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dragging himself out of bed and forcing himself through a quick shower and change of clothes, Ethan headed for the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he reached the entrance, his eyes landed on the Maybach umbrella he'd left on the console table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something clicked in his memory, a blurry conversation outside the bar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remembered asking her to take him home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan couldn't help but shake his head at himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never imagined he'd let a girl he'd only met twice and didn't even know the name of, drive him home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sighed deeply, shook his head, and walked out the door, his thoughts swirling as he left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the elevator, the conversation of two middle-aged women drifted into his ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you hear</span><span> that</span><span>? Last night, right outside our neighborhood, a girl almost got raped."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all over the neighborhood."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Girls shouldn't be out so late. It's dangerous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me about it. I don't know what that girl was thinking.</span><span> </span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan froze, a sudden thought hitting him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Wait, could they be talking about the girl who drove me home?</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Is she the one who almost got assaulted because she was helping me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought made his stomach turn, and an overwhelming sense of guilt surged through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting a moment, he rushed downstairs to check the security footage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, it was Lily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her frightened face on the screen tightened his chest with guilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He jumped into his car, intending to go to Orley University of Technology to find her, but then he realized he didn't even know her name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So instead, he went straight to the police station. He learned that Lily had been nearly attacked the night before, but the police had arrived just in time to save her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They also gave him her name and phone number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At a small caf&eacute; near the university, sunlight streamed through the windows, casting warm golden spots of light on the wooden table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan sat across from Lily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked nervous, almost visibly shaken, her hands clutched the edge of her clothes, her knuckles pale, and her eyes kept darting around, unable to settle. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear the events of last night had left her rattled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her in such a fragile state tugged at Ethan's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry... about last night," he said quietly, his voice full of regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily took a shaky breath, trying to calm herself. She reached for her coffee, but her hand trembled so much that the cup clinked against the saucer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound made him feel even worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had almost been assaulted by two men in one night. No wonder she was so terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't meant for any of this to happen, but if he hadn't asked her to drive him home, she wouldn't have been out so late and wouldn't have been in danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan rubbed his forehead, guilt eating away at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I drank too much last night," he tried to explain, his voice low and filled with helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It... It's fine... I... I know you're a good person, sir," Lily stammered, her words coming out in a rush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said it was fine, but her eyes betrayed her. Tears shimmered there, and her </span><span>vulnerable expression made his heart ache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan sighed, knowing that no matter how many apologies he offered, they wouldn't erase the fear she'd experienced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled out a card and slid it across the table to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's a million </span><span>dollars </span><span>in there. Please... consider it compensation for what happened."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily lowered her head even further, her long bangs falling to hide the glimmer of emotion in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan assumed she was offended, that she felt humiliated by his offer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he didn't realize was that, deep down, Lily was almost bursting with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her mind, she was silently celebrating. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He's playing along! I won't have to keep up the act anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Aurora, we're about to get the money!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Tomorrow, we'll leave</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> the city</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I'll study abroad, and you'll take care of everything back home. Our future is going to be perfect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only thing she regretted was that the man in front of her was exactly her type.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew she'd never have the chance to date him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to her, no man was as important as Aurora.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="118.html">« Prev</a><a href="120.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
