They shook, their once proud heads hanging low in pure terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the women shook violently, her muscles spasming in tension. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a tearful plea, she begged, "Mr. Hawke, please</span><span> punish me in another way</span><span>. </span><span>We really know what we did wrong</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her husband, usually confident and assertive in the business world, was now desperate, his demeanor ingratiating as he approached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He begged, "Mr. Hawke, please forgive us. My wife doesn't know better. Spare her. We're willing to pay any price!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other three women, already reduced to a sobbing mess, had their meticulously applied makeup running down their faces, turning them into a pitiful sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They cried out, "No! Please, don't strip us of our clothes. This is too humiliating. Mr. Hawke, have mercy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's smile held an eerie, knowing quality as his voice rumbled low, rich with intent. "You're really willing to pay any price?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought they saw a flicker of leniency in his eyes, a faint hope sparked within them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, </span><span>what came out of</span><span> Julian</span><span>&rsquo;s mouth next</span><span> crushed their hopes completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Would you be willing to go bankrupt for it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, the atmosphere in the banquet hall grew tense and suffocating. Everyone stood motionless, the smiles they had yet to express immediately vanishing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wife could be replaced, but the collapse of a company meant years of work gone in an instant. The chance of rising again was slimmer than a miracle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The husbands' eyes flickered between greed and inner conflict. After a brief moment of hesitation, the balance tipped heavily toward protecting their companies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could only watch as Julian signaled to the bodyguards to proceed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguards seized the women's arms, dragging them aside and forcing them to lay their hands flat on the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me go!" the women screamed and fought desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian, with an air of elegance, picked up a fruit knife. The blade gleamed coldly under the light, reflecting his steely expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He handed the knife to one of the women's husbands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man, his face twisted with fear, stammered, "Mr. Hawke, what do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian sneered coldly, his words deliberate, "You failed to discipline your wife, which is why she's wreaking havoc out here. Now, I'm giving you a chance to discipline her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's hand shook uncontrollably as he grasped the fruit knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze shifted between Julian's piercing eyes and his wife, who was now sobbing uncontrollably and on the brink of collapse. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's </span><span>dilemma</span><span> was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to beg for mercy, his lips trembling,</span><span> but his throat felt as though an invisible hand was choking the words out of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't listen to him," his wife cried out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man glanced at his wife, a flicker of pain and reluctance crossing his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to lower the knife, but when he locked eyes with Julian's cold, unrelenting gaze, his hand froze as if paralyzed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawke, please. Is there any other punishment? I... I really can't do this," the man pleaded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian</span><span> remained</span><span> silent and unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Aurora stood to the side, quietly observing, her eyes devoid of any pity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were the same people who had once humiliated her, beating her without a second thought. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, they never imagined they would find themselves trapped in such a brutal predicament back then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching them squirm in terror brought Aurora a strange sense of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned her gaze to Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The light fell on him, casting his figure in sharp relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora felt a deep sense of security in his presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes slightly welled up, and she was filled with a mix of emotions of gratitude, dependence, and an unfamiliar sense of safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was deathly silent, the air thick with tension. No one dared to make a sound, fearful of attracting Julian's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not a sound could be heard, save for the man's labored breathing and his wife's desperate sobs echoing through the tense space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll count to three. If you're not moving by the time I reach three, you won't get another chance." Julian's voice shattered the silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three..." His voice was as cold as ice, carrying an edge of finality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man flinched, his body trembling as his face contorted in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man gritted his teeth, his features twisted in pain as his eyes, bloodshot, darted around, like a cornered animal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the final count, he steeled himself. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sharp motion, he brought the knife down, severing his wife's thumb with brutal precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!</span><span>!!</span><span>" she screamed, her body jerking violently, before she collapsed backward, losing consciousness from the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguards wasted no time. They grabbed a bucket of ice-cold water, splashing it on the woman's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shock of the cold water revived her, and she awoke with a start, her eyes locking onto her severed bloody thumb. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She screamed again, her wails a heart-wrenching sound that filled the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man dropped the bloodied knife with a loud clatter, trembling uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fell to his knees, tears flooding from his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers were frozen in shock. Some women covered their mouths, unable to make a sound. Some men turned their heads, unwilling to witness the cruelty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people who had once been close to this couple now recoiled, afraid of being swept into this dreadful storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining three couples were now thoroughly terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's icy gaze swept over the kneeling man. His voice was devoid of any sympathy. "Next."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men stumbled backward, their faces ashen</span><span>. They could </span><span>barely able to stand, while their wives pleaded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian remained unmoved, and the women, desperate, turned to Aurora for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Elvador, we're sorry. We were wrong. Please, spare us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll do anything. Just let us go, please."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, we beg you</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked at their terrified faces, and not a shred of sympathy stirred in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only reason she could stand here and seek revenge was because Julian was protecting her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without him, she would've had to endure the beatings and humiliations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that had been the case, she would've been humiliated again the next time she crossed paths with these women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she didn't feel the need to forgive them just because they begged. She wouldn't be a saint for the ones who had hurt her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora bent down and picked up the bloodstained knife. The blood from the blade dripped onto the floor, splattering like red flowers on the polished surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She handed the knife to one of the men, a small, cryptic smile playing at the corner of her lips. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Your wife has to pay for what she did</span><span>. Don't you agree?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's eyes widened in fear. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl in front of him appeared delicate, but her eyes held a chilling resolve that made his blood run cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that she wouldn't let this go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he hesitated to take the knife, Aurora's smile faded. "I don't want to waste any </span><span>more time talking."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words were like frost, sending a shiver down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With trembling hands, he grabbed the knife and, in a final act of desperation, like the first man, he cut off his wife's thumb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, the screams echoed through the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four women had their thumbs severed, and their clothes were ripped off, leaving them in nothing but their </span><span>underwear</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their bodies, exposed to all, bore the marks of humiliation and pain, amplifying their desperate cries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguards dragged them out of the banquet hall, their wails still ringing in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was six o'clock in the afternoon, peak rush hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The streets were </span><span>bustling </span><span>with cars,</span><span> with</span><span> people coming and going.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four women were thrown out of the hotel, causing an immediate stir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pedestrians stopped in their tracks, staring with a mix of shock, curiosity, and pity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their dignity shattered, their hands crippled. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No family with wealth and status could tolerate such a ruined lady of the house. Their futures were now forever ruined...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in the banquet hall, the air was </span><span>filled </span><span>with an almost suffocating tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha and Adolph, having witnessed Julian's cruelty, dared not make a sound. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They shrank back, doing everything they could to avoid drawing attention, fearing they might be the next victims.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian turned toward Judy, his voice low and cold.
