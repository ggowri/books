Every call went straight to voicemail, and Hubery was starting to panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he couldn't take this case, he'd be right back to scraping by, picking through trash just to survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, out of nowhere, Hubery bumped into James on the street. And, James changed so much that Hubery almost didn't recognize him. The guy had really packed on the pounds and looked like a totally different person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, the basic features were still there, but he'd put on a serious amount of weight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery stared in shock at James, who was wheezing with each step. "James? What the hell happened to you in just a month?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was a total wreck. Once the campus heartthrob, ridiculously full of himself and obsessed with his looks, he'd turned into a greasy, bloated mess. Losing his job was just the cherry on top of his disaster sundae. Now, his wife was literally all he had left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shot Hubery a dead-eyed glance and shuffled forward, not even bothering to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery wasn't about to let him off that easy. "Hold up," he demanded, "We agreed to file for divorce a month ago. Where the hell did you disappear to? What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mind your own business and leave me alone." James' voice came out weak and listless. He'd gained weight recently, and it was clearly taking a toll. The guy could barely keep himself together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery wasn't about to back down. "Fine, I don't care where you've been. But right now, we need to focus on the divorce. Weren't you planning to get your hands on all your wife's assets? We still need to drum up some evidence that she's been cheating."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James felt his irritation rising. Looking at himself now, he knew the truth: if he actually went through with the divorce, what attractive woman would even give him a second look?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, Julian had made it crystal clear that any company working with Hawke Group wouldn't touch him. His career in Orley was basically dead in the water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't afford to divorce his wife, not now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, James said, "The divorce is off. Just go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's heart dropped the moment those words left James' mouth. "You can't just back out like this! We had a deal, remember? I win your divorce case, help you snag all your wife's assets, and you pay me a million dollars. You can't just go back on your word!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was at his wit's end. All he wanted was to get home, crash in bed, and rest until he felt strong enough to let his wife take him to the hospital. But Hubery just wouldn't take the hint, and that pushed James over the edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face twisted with rage as he exploded.</span><span> </span><span>"Are you fucking deaf? Whether I get divorced or not is none of your damn business!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery, whose life had gone seriously off the rails, had developed some serious mental issues.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being cursed out on the street by James&mdash;</span><span>whom</span><span> he saw as nothing but a fat pig&mdash;felt like a personal attack on his dignity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're the one who wanted to divorce your wife, </span><span>you</span><span> fat piece of trash, and now you're blaming me? Look at you, you've blown up like a balloon in just a month. God knows what kind of mess you've gotten yourself into to end up looking like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the last straw. James lunged at Hubery, fists swinging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery fought back just as hard. It was almost comical&mdash;a guy so overweight he could barely stand versus a man with no legs. They rolled around on the ground, equally matched in their pathetic state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A crowd of onlookers quickly formed a circle around them, eating up the spectacle like it was street entertainment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But neither man had the stamina to keep fighting for long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within minutes, they broke apart, both gasping for air, their faces a mess of bruises.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James let out a cold scoff and dragged his heavy body away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery, sprawled on the ground, struggled with all his might just to climb back into his wheelchair. As he slowly wheeled himself away from the scene, he didn't get far before a heavyset woman blocked his path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was none other than Cynthia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Y</span><span>ou've got a thing for Aurora</span><span>?</span><span> Want her? I can help with that," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery frowned at </span><span>her</span><span>, "Who are you? Why would you want to help me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sly grin spread across Cynthia's face. "I'm Cynthia. I'll help you win over Aurora because I want Julian for myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery gave Cynthia a once-over, unable to suppress the mental image of Julian being driven nuts by her relentless attention. A smug satisfaction settled in his chest at the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could somehow pair Julian with this Cynthia woman, Julian would become the laughingstock of high society.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Hmph, that's what you deserve for trying to compete with me for Aurora, Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next six months passed in a blur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During that time, Cynthia and Hubery plotted like snakes in the grass, looking for any angle to screw over Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she'd barely set foot outside the Hawke Estate, making their schemes about as useful as a screen door on a submarine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her health was going downhill fast, but she poured every ounce of strength into finishing that embroidery project.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That piece was her golden ticket to freedom&mdash;once completed, she could finally take Lily and Daisy abroad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now? Mission accomplished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She kept her mouth shut around Julian and Beatrice. They'd find the finished piece soon enough after she split.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that wrapped up, she could finally get down to her own business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her first stop would be the mental hospital where Celeste was being held.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before leaving the city for good, Aurora had to </span><span>see</span><span> her mother, who always played favorites and made her life miserable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wondered how six months in there had changed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only by seeing how karma had caught up with everyone who hurt her could she leave this life behind without regrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Aurora got ready to leave, Daniel was right there with her&mdash;it came with the job of being her personal bodyguard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fired up the car, and they headed toward the mental hospital, the hustle and bustle of the city just a blur outside their windows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora watched the streets fly by, her mind racing with thoughts of what she'd find when she finally saw Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mental hospital felt like a world of its own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A staff member led Aurora and Daniel down a long corridor, their footsteps echoing off the sterile walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On either side, iron-barred courtyards held patients in standard-issue hospital gowns, each lost in their own reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some sat motionless on benches, their vacant stares fixed on nothing as they muttered to themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others paced in endless circles, their movements mechanical and heavy, as if trapped in an invisible loop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few were boxing with shadows, their faces twisted in fear and rage as they fought enemies </span><span>only</span><span> they could see.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The corridor opened up to a garden, and the staff member pointed toward a white-haired woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's heart clenched at the sight. This couldn't be the elegant socialite she remembered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman's skin was rough and sagging, aging her well beyond her years. She looked every bit the elderly patient, nothing like her former polished self.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her arms, she cradled a baby doll, humming a tuneless lullaby as she rocked it gently, completely detached from the world around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This shell of a woman was Celeste.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="180.html">« Prev</a><a href="182.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
