Why not stay over tonight and leave in the</span><span> next</span><span> morning?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way. The dark gives those guys a better shot," she retorted bluntly and stepped out of the study.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The click-clack of her high heels echoed as she made her way down the stairs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett looked up and caught sight of her elegant figure descending.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe because he sensed that Aurora was about to be kidnapped and have her kidney stolen, his eyes softened.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are you going? I'll give you a lift."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora managed to hide her sarcasm</span><span>, finding him as hypocritic as ever</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've got two good legs, Barnett. I'm not a gimp; I can walk just fine," she snapped back, folding her arms across her chest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett frowned. For some odd reason, he didn't like hearing her say the word "gimp."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're such an ungrateful wretch," he mumbled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora sneered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ungrateful?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I'm the one about to be schemed by my own brother, and he has the nerve to act like he's being nice?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was done with his gall. Instead of arguing with someone who clearly had a screw loose, she walked out the door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There, she found Daisy waiting outside with her electric scooter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daisy!" she blurted out instinctively.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy stopped in her tracks for a second, looking genuinely taken aback. "You know me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was kind of weird. The moment Daisy set eyes on her, she felt this sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora paused, realizing that Daisy hadn't recognized her yet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Jerome mentioned you earlier," Aurora explained.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy frowned, clearly confused.</span><span> She wondered why Celeste would </span><span>bring up a servant like her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But despite her curiosity, she didn't push it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you going home? Where to? I can give you a lift," she offered with enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora shook her head. "No, </span><span>thanks. </span><span>I'm good.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you out so late?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy replied with a smile, "I'm going to pick up my daughter. She's in eighth grade. In a couple of months, she'll be off to high school. With her crazy school schedule, I need to pick her up late these days."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora smiled as she remembered that this was indeed the year </span><span>when </span><span>Lily was in eighth grade.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily had always been a </span><span>straight A student</span><span>. If it hadn't been for that previous life when she broke her arm while running an errand for Aurora's examination permit, she wouldn't have ended up at a so-so high school.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's awesome! Drive carefully out there," Aurora said warmly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought to herself,</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">In</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> this lifetime, there's no need to bring me the exam permit anymore. I'm sure Lily can get into a </span><span style="font-style: italic;">really great</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> high school.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you really sure you don't want a ride?" Daisy still looked worried.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be okay. Someone's </span><span>gonna</span><span> come and pick me up soon," Aurora said. She thought that it wouldn't be long before Joshua and his bunch tried to grab her once she left the villa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, someone's coming to pick you up? Well, that puts my mind at ease," Daisy said, flashing </span><span>Aurora</span><span> a friendly smile. Then she hopped on her scooter and zoomed off.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora didn't waste any time and stepped out of the villa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste watched from the shadows, her heart aching.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It hurt to see how much Aurora still cared about Daisy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, Aurora treated Daisy like a real mother, even better than she treated Celeste.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Aurora strolled through the residential area, the streetlights flickered on, creating bright patches of light.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't dark at all, but Aurora took her time walking towards the exit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a guy came from the opposite direction.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, she couldn't tell who it was and just paid him no mind as she kept walking.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as they got closer, she felt this sense of recognition.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they were close enough, she realized who it was</span><span>. I</span><span>t was Darren.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, Darren had harbored a dislike for Aurora for ages. It wasn't until she got out of prison that his tune changed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, he even lent her a hand in exposing Joshua's affair with Isabella.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stopped in her tracks, eyes wide in shock as she laid eyes on Darren.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He, on the other hand, felt a twinge of recognition when he saw her, though he couldn't quite put his finger on where they'd crossed paths before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing the </span><span>way</span><span> she was gawking at him, he thought she was probably just dazzled by his handsome mug.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren cleared his throat, trying to play it cool, and just brushed by her without saying a word.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora blinked in surprise but quickly got back on track and started walking again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They went their separate ways, and the distance between them started to grow.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Aurora was about to make her exit from the neighborhood, Darren suddenly let out a gasp.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait a sec! I remember now!</span><span> </span><span>She... she's that brainiac from </span><span>the Putnam's</span><span> Barron family!</span><span> </span><span>She got into MIT when she was just five, graduated by nine, and her ground-breaking research made waves all over the globe.</span><span>"</span><span> </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Aconoma</span><span> even dangled a fortune in front of her to get her on board, and then she just disappeared off the face of the earth for a solid eight years. </span><span>A year ago, holographic technology burst onto the scene, turning the healthcare industry on its head and finding its way into the </span><span>hologaming</span><span> world.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These kinds of hush-hush details are only in the know of the </span><span>big-wigs</span><span> in the hospital, the top-notch doctors."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As one of the country's leading physicians, Darren was well-versed in this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of a sudden</span><span>, he whipped around, his eyes alight with excitement as he stared at Aurora's fading silhouette.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora</span><span> </span><span>wa</span><span>s </span><span>his </span><span>idol</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could hardly wrap his head around the fact that he was finally seeing her in the flesh.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pumped with adrenaline, he picked up the pace to catch up with her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But right then, a black car came to a screeching halt at the neighborhood entrance. Two masked guys jumped out and </span><span>dragged </span><span>Aurora into the vehicle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren watched in sheer horror, his eyes popping out in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second thought, he took off after them like a bat out of hell.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But by the time he got out of the neighborhood, the black car had vanished into the night.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Shit! Shit! Shit!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The genius girl's been kidnapped!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">A once-in-a-blue-moon talent like her, if something goes wrong, it'll be a disaster for the country!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a total panic, Darren fumbled for his phone and punched in 911.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The police were shaken when they got the call.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Celeste could do a thing, Darren had already spilled the beans </span><span>to</span><span> the cops.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The police were </span><span>all shocked </span><span>when they got the call.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was like a national treasure under protection.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her contributions to the country were off the charts.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A scientific whiz like her should've been the </span><span>belle</span><span> of the ball in Orley, yet here she was, snatched away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If something went south, it'd be a total nightmare for Orley.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As one of the country's top ten economic cities, any mess involving this prodigy could set Orley back at least thirty years.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Orley police took the matter seriously and wasted no time launching a full-blown manhunt.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After being </span><span>kidnapped</span><span>, Aurora was drugged, just like in her past life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was out like a light as they carted her off to the hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unconscious, she lay on a frigid operating table, while on another table lay Bertha.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella tenderly stroked Bertha's head and cooed, "Don't you worry, honey. I'll start the surgery soon. Once we pop this little bitch's kidney into you, you'll be </span><span>alright</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha managed a feeble smile and turned her head to eye Aurora, her eyes blazing with envy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> what if that shameless Celeste is crazy about you?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And what if the Barron family spoils you rotten?
