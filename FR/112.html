Then, he slowly took Aurora's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Aurora's astonished gaze, he removed his pinky ring, a simple yet exquisite ring that sparkled with a cold light on his fingertip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian slid the ring onto Aurora's middle finger, the action slow and devout as if performing a sacred ritual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ring slid over Aurora's knuckles and finally rested steadily on her middle finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's heart felt as if gripped by an invisible hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked up, her eyes filled with confusion and shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawke..."
