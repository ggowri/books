When she saw the avalanche of debris cascading down the mountain, her eyes widened in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that split second, her body moved faster than her thoughts. Without hesitation, she leaped off Julian's back and used every ounce of strength she had to shove him forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't care if she died. She was already disabled. What difference would it make if she lived another day or not?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Julian was different. He'd come to this mountain just to be with her. He'd given up so much. If something happened to him, she couldn't live with herself, not even in death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian, caught completely off guard, stumbled forward. </span><span>When he got his feet back and spun around, Aurora was right there, smiling&mdash;sweet but sad, like someone saying their last goodbye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora locked eyes with him, her face saying everything she'd never told him. "Mr. Hawke," she choked out, "hope you get everything&mdash;perfect wife, cute kids, all that happiness you deserve..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rain came down like crazy, thunder and rocks crashing so loud her words got lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's face went ghost </span><span>white,</span><span> eyes huge. "AURORA!" he screamed, voice breaking as he dove for her without thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the </span><span>land</span><span>slide was about to bury her, Julian threw his body over hers, shielding her beneath him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact hit him like a truck, forcing a grunt from his lips as rocks pummeled his back. The pain shot through him like steel needles digging into his bones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he wouldn't let go. He held onto Aurora with everything he had, his veins bulging from the strain as he used every ounce of strength to create a safe pocket for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel spotted them and immediately shoved Bertha aside, spinning around to dash toward Julian and Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawke! Ms. </span><span>Elvador</span><span>!" he shouted, dodging falling rocks as he ran.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mud splattered all over him, and the rain blurred his vision to almost nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trapped in Julian's embrace, Aurora couldn't hold back her tears as they mixed with the rainwater streaming down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You shouldn't have saved me, Mr. Hawke..." Her choked words were mercilessly drowned by the chaotic rain and the thunderous roar of the landslide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The landslide was expanding rapidly, uprooting nearby trees and carrying them away with the rushing mud and sand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian spoke through gritted teeth, his words coming with great effort. "Aurora, don't be scared. I'm here with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice remained steady and gentle, offering Aurora one last comfort despite their desperate situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Buried beneath layers of mud, they were surrounded by complete darkness. Aurora couldn't see Julian, but she could feel him straining with all his might to hold himself above her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As more mud piled on, Julian bore what felt like a thousand pounds on his back. His arms, braced with all his strength, were slowly buckling under the pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, he clenched his jaw tightly, every muscle in his body tense from the effort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the darkness, Aurora reached out to touch Julian's face. Her fingertips met cold rainwater and mud on his skin, sending a sharp pain through her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could feel Julian's body trembling slightly, yet even now, he was using every ounce of his strength to protect her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a large boulder crashed down, hitting Julian directly. He let out a muffled groan as his body collapsed heavily onto Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hear</span><span>t </span><span>clenched in fear as she cried out, "Mr. Hawke, are you okay? </span><span>S</span><span>t</span><span>ay away from me</span><span>! I'm nothing but a burden. I don't deserve this from you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian held her even tighter, as if he hadn't heard her at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that tiny, pitch-black space, both of their breathing grew heavy and rapid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora could feel Julian's heartbeat clearly against her, but as time passed, it gradually weakened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tears flowed nonstop while guilt flooded her heart. If it hadn't been for her, Julian would never have ended up in this deadly trap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Julian, you can't die! You promised you'd stay with me forever!" Aurora's voice was swallowed by the pounding rain and thunderclaps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't... be... scared..." Julian's voice was barely audible, too faint for Aurora to hear or see anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All she could sense was Julian's motionless body on top of her, completely unresponsive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terror washed over Aurora like a tidal wave. She screamed "Help!" with a voice filled with endless desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how loudly she called out, nobody answered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mud continued to pile up as oxygen grew scarcer. Aurora felt her brain spinning as breathing became increasingly difficult. Her consciousness faded bit by bit until she finally blacked out completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had no idea how much time had passed when she finally drifted back to consciousness. </span><span>She wasn't even awake yet when that awful hospital smell slapped her in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The image of Julian shielding her before she </span><span>passed out</span><span> flashed through her mind. Her eyes snapped open to find herself in a hospital room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>White ceiling, white walls, and the beeping sounds of various machines&mdash;all these signs told Aurora she was still alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't care about herself. All she wanted was to see Julian as quickly as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora tried to get out of bed to find him, but her body just wouldn't cooperate. She felt completely numb, like her whole body was asleep and ignoring her commands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What's happening? Am I paralyzed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nurse! Nurse!" Aurora called out frantically, her voice shaking with panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, a plump nurse wearing a surgical mask entered the room, pushing a wheelchair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where's Julian? Is he okay?" Aurora asked urgently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's fine," the nurse replied flatly. "If you want to see him, I can take you to him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something about the woman's voice struck Aurora as incredibly familiar, but she couldn't quite place it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her mind completely focused on Julian, she didn't give it much thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, please take me </span><span>there</span><span> right away," Aurora urged impatiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nurse moved closer, transferring her from the hospital bed to the wheelchair. She then wheeled Aurora out of the room and into an elevator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the nurse pressed the button for the basement level, Aurora </span><span>frowned</span><span>. "Wait, there aren't supposed to be any patient rooms in the basement, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nurse stayed silent, and suddenly, the atmosphere in the elevator became suffocating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora sensed something was off. She whipped her head around and found herself staring into eyes filled with pure hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart pounded as a terrible feeling washed over her. "You're not a nurse. Who are you?" she demanded, her voice tense with suspicion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman slowly removed her mask. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're... Cynthia?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had only seen Cynthia once&mdash;at Lily's birthday party in room 101 at Grand Hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Cynthia had made a strong impression on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd packed on some serious pounds since then, but Aurora knew that face anywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, bet you didn't expect to see me," Cynthia smirked, eyes cold as ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's eyes went wide. "Cynthia, what do you want? Where's Julian?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't even save yourself, and you're worried about some other guy? How pathetic can you get?" Cynthia snorted coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora tried to get up, grinding her teeth, but her body was dead weight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Save it," Cynthia sneered. "That juice we shot you up with? Still kicking. You </span><span>ain't</span><span> going nowhere."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="185.html">« Prev</a><a href="187.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
