But before he could even leave, there she was, alive and right in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadn't that scoundrel Adolph sworn that Camille was under strict house arrest in a remote estate with no chance of escape?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's eyes darted around, and when they landed on Wilson and Lizeth, it all clicked. They must have brought her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sherwood couple was glaring at him with unmistakable hatred, eyes burning with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's heart sank. Camille must have told them everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beads of sweat formed on his forehead, and he couldn't bring himself to meet their gaze, quickly looking away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when his eyes fell on Beatrice and Ashley, he felt as if the ground had been ripped out from under him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What </span><span style="font-style: italic;">the hell </span><span style="font-style: italic;">were these two old hags doing here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remembered vividly how they had stood by Aurora's side the day Camille woke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the time, he had dismissed them as harmless, but now it was clear. Things were far more complicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman standing there, dressed like Daisy, was obviously a servant, but the elegant woman seated on the sofa? That had to be Beatrice, Julian's grandmother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization slammed into him like a sledgehammer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had unwittingly offended Beatrice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only hope she didn't recognize him, or else Bertha's release would be impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When his gaze finally landed on Aurora and Julian, his back went cold with sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was here too, seated proudly beside Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How had this happened?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had she seduced Julian in advance, knowing he had once considered arranging a marriage between them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua thought to himself.</span><br><span>Yes, that has to be it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora is nothing but a gold-digging, manipulative woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's mind spun, but he quickly masked his panic, forcing a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, you're here too," he said, his tone dripping with false concern. "You've been gone so long without a word. I've been so worried."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora, the illegitimate child he had always despised, had always craved family affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could use that to manipulate her into convincing Julian to release Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead of the softness he expected, Aurora met his gaze with pure hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After reading Daniel's findings, she initially wanted to tear him apart. Now, she wished for him to suffer a fate worse than death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, he would learn the full truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't wait to see his reaction. How did he feel when he discovered his beloved daughter wasn't his own and that all his scheming had only served others?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora smirked. "You worried about me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course! I'm your father," Joshua insisted, his shamelessness on full display.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The word "father" drew sneers from everyone in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wilson looked at him as if he were filth. "Planned to carve up your own daughter, harvest her organs for your fucking mistress' child, and dare call yourself a father?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lizeth chimed in, her voice icy, "Strip your daughter of her heart, her liver, everything. You father?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy added, "Using her body for your damn reputation? You're a total fucking disgrace."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, they laid out his crimes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua felt as if he'd been struck by lightning, his face pale and his mind reeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes darted around the room, panic setting in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always known keeping Camille alive was a mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He should have killed her when she was still in a vegetative state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Who could have predicted she'd wake up? Damn it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face twitched with unease, but he forced himself to stay composed. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said weakly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camille let out a cold laugh. "Isn't this exactly what you and Bertha were plotting five years ago?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you wanted to drive your wife insane, looking like the 'loving husband.' Once you controlled </span><span>Elvador</span><span> Group, you'd kill her and marry Isabella. And Barnett? You'd have him work for your mistress and her kids, making sure he gets nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! You're lying! This is all a setup!" Joshua protested, his voice shaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A setup?" Camille's eyes widened, her emaciated face making her look almost monstrous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You pushed me down the stairs, I heard your plan, but I survived."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I ruined your plans, so you framed Aurora for murder."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to </span><span>Celeste,</span><span> her gaze filled with scorn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, Mrs. </span><span>Elvador</span><span>, you're really something as the wife and mother. You deleted the surveillance footage that could&rsquo;ve cleared Aurora, ensuring she took the fall for Bertha. Five years in prison</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>impressive job ensuring your own daughter suffered beyond belief."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste felt as if she'd been plunged into an icy abyss, her entire body trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Learning that Joshua had abandoned Aurora, killed her father, and raised his mistress' child as her own had already shattered her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the truth of what had happened five years ago was a hundred times more devastating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua and Bertha had tried to kill Aurora, and when that failed, they framed her for attempted murder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she, Celeste, had helped destroy the evidence and convinced Aurora to take the blame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her breathing grew ragged, her heart feeling as if it were being torn apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A metallic taste filled her mouth, and before she could stop it, she spat out a mouthful of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body swayed, but her remaining eye fixed on Aurora, filled with remorse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She reached out a trembling hand, as if to touch her daughter's face, to express her regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her vision darkened, and she collapsed to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before losing consciousness, she saw Aurora sitting motionless on the sofa, her indifference cutting deeper than any blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora wasn't like this before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Celeste who had destroyed their bond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, I'm sorry," she whispered before darkness claimed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora didn't even flinch, leaving Celeste lying cold on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the door to the living room opened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan walked in, followed by Bertha, Isabella, and Adolph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawke, I've brought everyone you asked for," Ethan </span><span>said.Julian</span><span> nodded, a cold smirk curling his lips.
