His eyes burned with rage and disbelief at this perceived betrayal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora gave </span><span>Hubery</span><span> a cold, dismissive glance&mdash;the kind she'd give to some random stranger before quickly looking away. Her expression made it crystal clear she wanted zero connection with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since </span><span>Hubery</span><span> had both legs broken in jail, his emotions had become completely unmanageable&mdash;a wild roller coaster swinging between explosive anger and crushing despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The loss of his law license had shattered his career.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, they'd seized his house, his car, his savings&mdash;his life had nosedived from success to rock bottom with no chance of recovery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once-confident and accomplished </span><span>Hubery</span><span> now lived in a damp, moldy basement where the darkness and mustiness constantly ate away at what remained of his spirit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Former friends, colleagues, and even strangers now looked at him with mockery and contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his twenty-some years of life, he'd never faced such humiliation&mdash;not even during those tough years at the orphanage had anyone trampled his dignity so thoroughly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd lost everything&mdash;career, status, wealth&mdash;all vanished overnight like they'd never existed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had become the only light of salvation in his darkened world. Every day, he'd desperately hoped to see her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After endless waiting, today finally brought that chance&mdash;only for him to be thunderstruck by the sight of another man by her side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She treated him like he was a complete stranger. He'd never expected this in a million years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery</span><span> struggled to maneuver his wheelchair to block Aurora's path, his voice catching with urgency. "Aurora, I&rsquo;m asking you. Who the hell is that man?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora didn't bother hiding her irritation. "Who he is has nothing to do with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those few simple words hit </span><span>Hubery</span><span> like a sledgehammer to the chest, knocking the wind right out of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fingers dug into the metal frame of his wheelchair until his knuckles turned white. The icy metal beneath his fingertips sent chills through his entire body, yet nothing compared to the cold spreading through his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is she trying to cut me out of her life </span><span style="font-style: italic;">completely?</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>No way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't accept that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean it has nothing to do with me? We grew up together&mdash;we're childhood sweethearts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora let out a mocking laugh. "You were my childhood friend, not my dad. Who made you the boss of who I hang out with?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's</span><span> face instantly turned ashen as he glared at Daniel standing beside Aurora. Jealousy and rage burned in his eyes like wildfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through gritted teeth, he hissed, "Aurora, have you forgotten our promise? You said once I made something of myself, you'd stay by my side forever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked at him like he'd just told the most ridiculous joke she'd ever heard. Her smile grew increasingly contemptuous as a wave of profound sadness and disappointment washed over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, they'd clung to each other at the orphanage, and she truly believed she and </span><span>Hubery</span><span> would stick together for life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he said, "I'll study law, put everyone who ever hurt you behind bars," those words hypnotized her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She worked multiple jobs, entered countless competitions, and fought tooth and nail for scholarships year after year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing how proud he was, she anonymously sent every penny she earned to </span><span>Hubery</span><span>, hoping he wouldn't have to struggle like other poor kids who had to work their way through school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the hardship, she'd been happy then, driven by the dream that sustained her&mdash;imagining </span><span>Hubery</span><span> graduating to become </span><span>Orley's</span><span> most celebrated attorney with her safely under his protective wing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reality, however, slapped her hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did </span><span>Hubery</span><span> fail to put her bullies in prison, he actually put her&mdash;the victim&mdash;behind bars instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even more ridiculous was how he spent the money. Instead of buying textbooks or basic necessities, he blew it on thousand-dollar Nike sneakers, Arc'teryx jackets worth four or five grand each, a Montblanc watch over 50 thousand dollars, and frequent gifts for Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha, that spoiled little rich girl, didn't even appreciate the "cheap" presents that </span><span>Hubery</span><span> gave her and just handed them off to the household staff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having grown up dirt poor, Aurora couldn't recognize these luxury brands and never realized that </span><span>Hubery</span><span>, a mere college student, was walking around in nearly 100 thousand dollars' worth of designer gear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until Daniel investigated the </span><span>Elvador</span><span> family&mdash;discovering Bertha had impersonated </span><span>Hubery's</span><span> anonymous donor&mdash;that he uncovered what happened during </span><span>Hubery's</span><span> college years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did she finally wake up from her delusions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All that time, </span><span>Hubery</span><span> had been using the money to craft this fake rich-kid persona for himself. He wasn't the person she remembered at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd transformed into someone greedy, selfish, and obsessed with appearances&mdash;exactly the type of person she despised most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora let out a cold laugh, her eyes filled with contempt. "A promise? Do you honestly think you deserve that from me, </span><span>Hubery</span><span>?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You seriously believe I'd forgive you after you sent me to prison?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haven't I made my disgust clear enough since I got out? Drop this ridiculous confidence. You're less than a stranger to me&mdash;at least strangers don't make me sick. Every time I see your face, I feel like throwing up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery</span><span> flinched as if her words had physically struck him. His face flushed, a mix of rage and humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I didn't send to prison&mdash;you did that to yourself." He argued. "If you hadn't pushed Camille down those stairs and left her in a vegetative state, you wouldn't have been convicted. You earned that jail time all on your own. Don't try to blame me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's expression instantly transformed into one of pure disgust. She couldn't tolerate his nonsense and slapped him hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you blind? Or just deaf?" she shouted. "Camille woke up and confirmed I wasn't responsible the very day she regained consciousness! How much longer are you going to keep lying to yourself?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you all hadn't kept interfering, Camille would have pegged Bertha as the true murderer. You've got some nerve throwing mud at me. Make me absolutely sick."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's</span><span> mind went completely blank from the blow. He refused to admit he'd made a mistake five years ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because once he acknowledged his error, whatever existed between him and Aurora would be finished forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why he'd been so desperate to pin the blame on Aurora, hoping she'd carry the stigma of attempted murder for the rest of her life. Only then would she remain dependent on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sending her to prison back then had actually been because he discovered Adolph's feelings for her and their engagement agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't bear watching them marry and seeing the girl he'd raised become another man's wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He preferred to destroy her reputation, making her despised by everyone, she'd have no choice but to rely on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His obsession with controlling Aurora was deeply disturbed&mdash;just like now, seeing her with another man completely unhinged him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When his eyes landed on the ring adorning Aurora's left hand, </span><span>Hubery's</span><span> suppressed emotions exploded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's that ring on your finger? Are you engaged?" he demanded. "Who gave you permission to get engaged to some random guy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can only have me in your heart! Only I can make you happy! Yet here you are, hooking up with another man when I'm at my lowest point. How could you be so cheap, Aurora? Have you already slept with him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shameless! Your body is covered in injuries, missing a kidney, and still this desperate? Can't survive without a man, can you? First Adolph, now him... How many men have you actually slept with? Tell me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery</span><span> ranted like a lunatic, spewing vulgar insults as if Aurora were his personal property that no one else was allowed to touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora glanced down at the ring on her middle finger&mdash;Julian's pinky ring that fit her middle finger perfectly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, such humiliation would have made Aurora's face flush with anger, but this time she didn't get upset. She happily wrapped her arm around Daniel's with a blissful expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right, we're together now." She confirmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then placed her other hand gently over her stomach. "And I have more good news for you&mdash;I'm pregnant. We came to the hospital today for a prenatal checkup."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those two words&mdash;"I'm pregnant"&mdash;hit like lightning from a clear blue sky, leaving Daniel completely stunned and </span><span>Hubery</span><span> utterly devastated.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="127.html">« Prev</a><a href="129.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
