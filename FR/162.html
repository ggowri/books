I was so cool, and you didn't even praise me. You're really breaking my heart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's gaze was cold, staring at him without blinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under her gaze, Samuel's heart raced, and his face turned slightly red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly looked down, pretending to search for his phone, but it was really to hide his inner turmoil and excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a voice in his head screamed.</span><br><span>Damn, Ms. Walker's look of disdain is so thrilling! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I love it! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ms. Walker, keep looking at me like that, only at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fumbled for his phone and, without thinking, transferred a million dollars to Lily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the sudden increase in her account balance, Lily was slightly stunned. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean by this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel chuckled, scratching his head, and explained, "Didn't you agree to be my girlfriend for a day for 100 thousand dollars? I'm giving you a million dollars, so be my girlfriend for ten days, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint smile tugged at Lily's lips, and a hint of amusement flashed in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She found Samuel's behavior somewhat endearing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stepped closer to Samuel, grabbed his collar, and forced him to lower his head to meet her gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel's heart skipped a beat at her sudden move. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face turned completely red, all the way to his ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Walker, what are you doing?" He stammered, his mind involuntarily conjuring images of a kiss.</span><br><span>Is Ms. Walker going to kiss me? No, I'm not ready for a kiss yet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But since Ms. Walker is taking the initiative, bring it on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel slowly closed his eyes, puckered his lips nervously, and waited for Lily's kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily looked at his silly expression and barely suppressed a laugh. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you still need a girlfriend after ten days, as long as you pay, I'm at your service."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she let go of him and pushed him away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel's fantasy shattered, leaving him feeling empty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Lily with a pitiful, resentful gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I spent a million dollars to have her for ten days, and she didn't even give me a kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the others began arriving at the finish line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel saw his rival and flashed a mocking smile, raising an eyebrow. "You lost."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edie snorted and pushed Cynthia toward Samuel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here, take her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia stumbled into Samuel's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel acted like he had touched something dirty and pushed her away in disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never said I wanted her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edie sneered, "Didn't we agree? If I lost, I'd give Cynthia back to you. If you lost, you'd give me your woman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, his gaze landed on Lily. He looked her up and down shamelessly and let out a flirtatious whistle. "Hey, beauty, what's your name?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily acted as if she hadn't heard him, not even glancing his way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edie's face darkened, and his brows furrowed. He said in a hostile tone, "I'm talking to you. Are you deaf?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since discovering Aurora's hearing loss, Lily had become very sensitive to that word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned around, her gaze like icy daggers, and said coldly, "I have no obligation to tell you that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edie was taken aback, then a playful smile reappeared on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Samuel Lowell, this girl's got some attitude. Why don't you let me have her? Don't you like Cynthia? We can swap."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't like Cynthia. I'm not a garbage collector. I don't take trash." Samuel's face turned red with anger as he lashed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he pulled Lily behind him, shielding her completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, he pushed Cynthia back toward the man. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You take care of your own woman. I'm not interested. My new girlfriend is a thousand times better than her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia was humiliated, tears welling up in her eyes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said pitifully, "Samuel, how could you say that to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel shot her a look. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>You don</span><span>'</span><span>t seriously think I agreed to the race for you, do you?</span><span>"</span><br><span>"</span><span>Isn</span><span>'</span><span>t that why?</span><span>"</span><br><span>"</span><span>Not at all! I just wanted you to see how much better my current girlfriend is. Stop </span><span>flattering yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." Cynthia stomped her foot in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit her lip, tears streaming down her face, and said with grievance, "Edie, he's humiliating me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edie clicked his tongue, glanced at Samuel, and said in a harsh tone,</span><span> </span><span>"Mr. Samuel Lowell, that</span><span>'</span><span>s not how it works.
