"I'll do anything</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>just spare me!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily didn</span><span>'</span><span>t move, her stillness more terrifying than any motion. Her gaze was colder than the steel in her grip.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The memory burned behind her eyes</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>Aurora</span><span>'</span><span>s porcelain skin against the operating table, the waxy pallor of death.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mercy?" Lily</span><span>'</span><span>s voice could have frozen the depths of hell. "Did you show Aurora any?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora</span><span>...</span><span> born into wealth, destined to be a pampered princess</span><span>... </span><span>and you two monsters ruined her." </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's voice dropped to a chilling whisper, her knife never faltering.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank's screams tore through the air, raw and gut-wrenching.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora was the kindest soul, yet she's gone. And you filth still dare to breathe? You deserve to die. Both of you. You should rot in hell."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room reeked of blood, thick and suffocating.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For three agonizing hours, Lily dissected Frank, piece by excruciating piece.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Throughout the entire ordeal, Frank remained conscious. He was a prisoner in his own body, forced to watch his own demise.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella witnessed it all, her body frozen in sheer terror, her gaze vacant. She was a mere shell of her former self.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When only meat remained, Lily finally turned. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression hadn't changed. "</span><span>Your turn.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words electrocuted Isabella back to consciousness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! Please, no!" Isabella shook her head frantically, tears spilling over. "I'm begging you... </span><span>please l</span><span>et me go..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily observed her coldly, watching the pathetic display of terror. "How amusing. Even demons beg when Death comes knocking."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The knife's cold edge traced a slow line down Isabella's cheek. A shudder wracked her body, her bladder releasing in pure terror.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry," Lily murmured, almost tenderly. "You'll be with your beloved soon. He's waiting for you... in hell." The blade lifted, catching the light.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella's pupils dilated as the steel flashed downward. Every instinct screamed</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>she didn't want to die.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't kill me!" The shriek tore from her throat, raw and desperate.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The knife froze. Four inches from her eyeball.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella stared cross-eyed at the gleaming point, her entire body vibrating with terror.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's lips curled. "Can't kill you?" A dark chuckle. "Who do you think you are? I'll slaughter everyone who touched Aurora." </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blade crept closer with each word.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A secret!" Isabella screamed. "I'll tell you a secret if you spare me!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't care." Lily's eyes burned crimson, feral with bloodlust. "Your death is all that matters</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>even if it destroys me too." </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The knife descended</span><span>&mdash;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's about Aurora!" Isabella squeezed her eyes shut.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air hung heavy and still in silence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No pain came. Isabella cracked one eye open</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>the blade hovered a hair's breadth away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's eyes had gone predator-still. "Speak. Now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella clenched her jaw. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was her only card.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine." Lily shrugged. "Aurora's dead. Her secrets died with her." </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The knife flashed down</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>T</span><span>HUK!</span><span> It buried deep in Isabella's shoulder.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella's scream tore through the air as her eyes flew open. "Please! I'll tell you everything!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily wrenched the blade free with a wet schlick, her lips curling in disgust. "Pathetic. Your next words had better be worth my time." </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pressed the bloody tip under Isabella's chin. "Lie to me, and I'll make Frank's death feel like mercy."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily was a demon.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella drowned in terror, regret choking her. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That damned phone call from Cynthia... Aurora had already spared them once. If only they'd walked away</span><span>&mdash;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now it was too late. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With trembling lips, Isabella confessed Aurora's secret.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily listened, if only for Aurora's sake.</span><span> </span><span>But as the words sank in</span><span>&mdash;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A daughter?" Lily's voice cracked. "Aurora... had a child in prison?" The knife trembled in her grip. "You'd mock her memory with this filth?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rage ignited like wildfire. Aurora's name was sacred. Her pain, her dignity&mdash;untouchable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella shrank beneath Lily's blood-red gaze. "I-I swear it's true!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're dead." Lily raised the blade&mdash;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill me and the child disappears forever!" Isabella shrieked. "She's Aurora's blood... but not her body!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The knife froze. Lily's breath came in ragged gasps. "Explain. Now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll tell you. I'll tell you everything," Isabella blurted out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Isabella recounted the child's origin, leaving no stone unturned.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Lily listened to the whole sordid tale, she felt the world spin around her. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She coughed up a mouthful of blood, her vision blurring. "You monsters, you're all monsters!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder her mother had told her that Aurora hadn't had a period since she got out of prison.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Aurora was so frail.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The prison torment had been far more elaborate than simple beatings or stolen organs. During that barbaric "surgery," while anesthesia clouded Aurora's mind, they'd pumped her full of hormones. Harvested her eggs like ripe fruit from an orchard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had awakened in agony, blaming only the missing kidney. Never suspecting they'd hollowed out her womanhood, leaving her barren. Never knowing they'd stolen her future along with her flesh.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These heartless beasts, Frank, Isabella, Joshua, and Bertha, had taken Aurora's eggs because they feared Isabella and Bertha's kidneys might fail again. So, they used her eggs for surrogacy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The resulting child's kidneys would likely be a match for them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If their kidneys failed again, Aurora's child would become their human organ bank, to be harvested whenever they needed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the cruelest cut of all? </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had died without ever knowing she'd left behind a piece of herself. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A</span><span> two-year-old daughter</span><span>.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="195.html">« Prev</a><a href="197.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
