Please."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mouth twisted into this sick, satisfied grin that made him look like a venomous snake about to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sleeping next to you made my skin crawl. Especially during sex&mdash;God, you were like a corpse, cold and unfelling. How could you even compare to Isabella? Hell, you're not even good enough to be her doormat." He bobbed his head around, practically bragging about his dirty little secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Might as well tell you now&mdash;I never liked you, not even at the beginning. If your family hadn't been loaded, I wouldn't have given someone as stupid as you a second glance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank God you were such dumb enough, or I can&rsquo;t steal Jerome Group right </span><span>out .</span><span> Once I get out of here, I'm taking my real family&mdash;the woman I actually love and our kids</span><span>, </span><span>and we're moving abroad. What can you possibly do about it? Nothing!" he howled with laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His whole body shook with it, making those bloody scratches on his face look even more grotesque&mdash;like centipedes crawling across his skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's brutal confession was like pouring acid straight into Celeste's gaping wounds, sending her adrenaline through the roof.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, something primal took over her body&mdash;some dark, explosive force that made her completely numb to the searing pain in both her leg and eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her chest heaved violently as her heavy breathing filled the hospital room like a soundtrack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She braced herself against the floor, the veins in her hands bulging as she pushed herself up to standing, muscles straining with the effort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua, who'd been laughing his head off, caught sight of this miraculous scene, and his laughter cut off instantly, smile freezing on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes went wide as saucers, his expression screaming "this can't be happening".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's face twisted with rage, transforming her once gentle features into something absolutely terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mouth contorted into a snarl, teeth grinding audibly while the muscles in her face twitched uncontrollably&mdash;she looked like a demon straight out of hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You monster, I'm going to kill you," she growled, her voice shredded and raw as she threw herself at Joshua with everything she had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rage gave her superhuman strength as she wrenched the knife from Joshua's hand with an iron grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One swift stab and Joshua howled like he was being murdered, his scream echoing off the walls as blood poured from between his legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste completely lost it, stabbing down again and again in a frenzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood sprayed everywhere&mdash;on her face, her clothes&mdash;but she didn't even notice and just kept repeating the same brutal motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You love cheating so much? Let's see you how cheat now! Hah!" she cackled maniacally while stabbing wildly, destroying Joshua's manhood in just a few brutal jabs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's blood soaked through the sheets as his body convulsed from the unbearable pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The metallic smell of blood filled the room and seeped under the door into the hallway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stood outside, watching Joshua and Celeste tear each other apart with complete emotional detachment&mdash;not a single shred of sympathy in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Years of coldness and pain in this family had gradually drained away every last drop of affection she might have had for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought these two people totally deserved the horrific ending playing out before her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One with a missing eye, the other without his manhood&mdash;the brutal outcome shocked Aurora, but she couldn't deny the deep satisfaction it brought her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was karma at its finest&mdash;evil people getting their just deserts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, what kind of world would it be if the wicked escaped punishment?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These thoughts swirled through her mind as the pressure that had been building inside her for days finally released. A relaxed smile spread across her face, tinged with the sweet taste of revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, hurried footsteps echoed from the end of the hallway as Isabella rushed toward them with several medical staff in tow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora froze, realizing she had no time to hide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that critical moment, Daniel shifted his body sideways, his tall, imposing frame shielding Aurora's petite figure like a mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora pressed herself between Daniel and the wall, lowering her head to minimize her presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella completely missed seeing Aurora as she burst straight into the hospital room with her team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they saw the blood-soaked bed and floor, even the medical staff&mdash;people who routinely dealt with blood&mdash;turned ghostly pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella's mind went blank for a second when she saw the gruesome state of Joshua's groin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua had always been worthless, but at least he served a purpose in the bedroom. Now, with that part of him gone, he's completely useless&mdash;nothing more than a shell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Isabella's shock lasted only a moment before she mentally shrugged it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't like she actually cared about Joshua.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How could she possibly have feelings for a scumbag who would abandon his wife and children?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd always worried that someday she might fall out of his favor and he'd quietly get rid of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her view, heartless monsters like Joshua were only good for being used&mdash;they didn't deserve genuine affection or loyalty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't fathom what kind of genetic mutation could produce a predator like Joshua.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella quickly regained her composure and turned sharply to the medical staff. "What are you all standing around for? Save him now!" she barked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The medical team snapped out of their shock and rushed to Joshua's side, frantically wheeling him out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By this point, Celeste had completely collapsed from exhaustion, unconscious on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella ordered the staff to take Celeste to surgery as well&mdash;not out of kindness, but she needed to maintain appearances as hospital director with all those medical professionals watching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once everyone had cleared out, Daniel finally stepped aside, revealing Aurora standing behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why didn't you tell Joshua that Bertha isn't his daughter?" Daniel asked. "Wouldn't that have crushed him completely?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora smiled faintly, "Telling him now would be letting him off too easy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't he like squeezing every drop of value from people? Well, I'm taking a page from his book. Let his precious daughter drain him completely dry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With Bertha in prison, Joshua will move heaven and earth to free her. He&rsquo;ll throw everything away for a daughter who&rsquo;s got no blood connection to him. Then, when he&rsquo;s lost all, I&rsquo;ll tell him the truth&mdash;those kids? Not his. That's when he'll truly wish he were dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's face would be priceless when he found out he destroyed his own son's life for a daughter who wasn't even blood-related.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasn't family legacy his biggest obsession? Well, the precious </span><span>Elvador</span><span> bloodline was officially extinct now. It served him right!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel raised an eyebrow. "You're such a badass, Ms. </span><span>Elvador</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take that as a compliment</span><span>.</span><span>" she responded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They shared a knowing smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they left the hospital and walked toward the parking lot, they unexpectedly ran into someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man sat in a wheelchair, a far cry from his former self&mdash;no longer the sharp, polished attorney he once was. His clothes were ragged, his once-strong frame now gaunt. His cheekbones jutted prominently while dark circles shadowed his eyes, making him worn down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was none other than </span><span>Hubery</span><span>, Aurora's childhood sweetheart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery</span><span> hadn't seen Aurora for almost two months, and this sudden encounter left him feeling like he'd stepped into an alternate reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had transformed dramatically. Her face had filled out, her skin glowed, and her once straw-like hair now fell in sleek waves around her shoulders. Everything about her radiated happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He, on the other hand, had clearly fallen apart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Th</span><span>e stark contrast made </span><span>Hubery</span><span> want to disappear into thin air.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd always been the successful, put-together one, and this role reversal hit him hard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he spotted the tall, handsome, rugged man beside Aurora, jealousy tore through him like wildfire. "Who's this guy?" he demanded instinctively.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="126.html">« Prev</a><a href="128.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
