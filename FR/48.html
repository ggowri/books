"Next, we will auction the most anticipated item of the night&mdash;the land in the eastern suburbs. This land is in a prime location with immense future development potential. The starting bid is one billion dollars, and each bid must increase by at least 10 million dollars. We invite all bidders to join the competition!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew that whoever secured this piece of land would be holding a golden goose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett raised his paddle first, his voice calm and authoritative. "One billion and fifty million."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze was steady. As a representative of the Elvador family, he was determined to win this bid. Securing this land would not only expand Elvador Group's reach but also give them a strong presence in the Orley business district.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before his words even had a chance to fully settle, Adolph jumped in. "One billion one hundred million."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph, dressed in a dark suit with his hair neatly styled, exuded confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these two starting the bidding, others were quick to follow suit, and the price climbed rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room felt like a taut bowstring, ready to snap at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few smaller families and businesses, seeing the escalating bids, sighed in resignation, realizing they were out of the game. They could only watch as the industry giants battled it out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the price soared to two billion dollars, and the number of bidders began to dwindle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Ethan Ward, the assistant to the heir of the Hawke family, who had been silent up until now, slowly raised his paddle. His voice was calm. "Three billion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression was unreadable, but the bid he announced was like a bombshell, sending a ripple of stunned silence through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Elvador family's members looked grim. They knew the Hawke family had deep pockets, but they hadn't anticipated the Hawke family's financial might to be this overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While others were raising bids by millions, the Hawke family had upped the ante by a full one billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three billion. The price had already exceeded what the Elvador family had planned for, and now they were trapped. If they backed out, all their previous efforts would be in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett glanced at Adolph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph frowned slightly, tapping his fingers on the armrest of his chair. After a moment, he gave a nod to Barnett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no choice. The two families would have to work together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they were going to win the land, they would have to share the development.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Adolph's financial support, Barnett felt more confident. He raised his paddle again and announced, "Three billion five hundred million."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even shot a provocative glance toward the heir of the Hawke family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the heir didn't even glance at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan, still composed, raised his paddle again. "Four billion five hundred million."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was another one billion dollar jump.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett wasn't about to give up. "Five billion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan simply responded with, "Six billion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett clenched his jaw. "Six and a half billion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan remained unmoved. "Eight billion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett and Adolph both stood up, their eyes wide in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stared at the heir of the Hawke family and Ethan, who had just made the bidding even more absurd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eight billion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The price was now close to exceeding the land's actual value.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett shot a furious glare at Julian Hawke. "Julian Hawke, are you out of your mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian Hawke, the Hawke heir, finally turned to Barnett and said coolly, "Place your bid."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His calm look seemed to say, "Whatever you bid, I'll just top it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This confidence threw Barnett off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with the Elvador and Sherwood families' combined 10 billion dollars, if the bidding went higher, the Elvador family could face a financial crisis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua, nearby, looked tense, lips tight, but powerless to do anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph seemed composed, but his eyes showed his anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sherwood family had put up a lot of money for this auction, and losing would be a huge blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett gritted his teeth. "Eight billion five hundred million."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before his words had even fully left his mouth, Ethan raised his paddle again. "Ten billion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent for a long moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett and Adolph exchanged a look, and from each other's eyes, they saw nothing but resignation. They knew the game was over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ten billion, going once. Ten billion, going twice. Ten billion, sold!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The host called out, hammering down on the gavel, officially awarding the land in the eastern suburbs to the Hawke family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Elvador and Sherwood families were crushed, their spirits sinking. Joshua was livid but had to suppress his anger, given the setting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett slumped back into his seat, dejected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they had expected, the Hawke family lived up to its reputation. They managed to drop 10 billion dollars without even flinching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua and Barnett exchanged a look. They were forced to accept defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that the only way they would now get involved in the eastern suburbs project was through a marriage alliance between Aurora and Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett took a deep breath, stood up, straightened his clothes, and tried to maintain his dignity. He approached Julian and extended his hand with a friendly smile. "I've long heard of the Hawke family's reputation. Now that I've met you, it's clear that the rumors are true&mdash;you certainly have the power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's face remained neutral, but he shook Barnett's hand politely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua, pushing aside his displeasure, plastered on a smile full of wrinkles. "Since the auction is over, how about we head to the banquet hall? What do you think, Mr. Hawke?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian gave a brief "Mm," before leaving. He gave Ethan a look, signaling him to proceed with the paperwork for the land transfer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time they arrived at the banquet hall, Aurora had just arrived as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver spotted Bertha and quickly approached her, slipping something into her hand while whispering, "Bertha, here's what you wanted."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the driver swiftly left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha glanced at Aurora, who was busy surveying the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha casually picked up a glass of juice, poured the powder the driver had given her into the drink, and stirred it. She then called over a server.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please deliver this drink to her," Bertha said, gesturing toward Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The server nodded and made his way to Aurora with the drink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora didn't think much of it. It was normal for servers to deliver drinks at banquets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, she was hungry since she hadn't eaten dinner and needed something to eat and drink, so she took the drink and walked over to the dessert table, nibbling on pastries while sipping from the glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha watched from the side, a sinister glint in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She walked up to Aurora with a smirk on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at you, acting like you've never seen the finer things in life. You're embarrassing yourself," Bertha sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was about to take a bite of the cake when she heard Bertha's irritating voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I being too tolerant of you? You'd better stay away from me, or I'll slap that cake right in your face. Then you can tell me who's embarrassing themselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha's face turned ugly with rage, wishing she could tear Aurora's seductive face apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she hadn't completely lost control of herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she thought about the drink Aurora had just consumed, Bertha felt a surge of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll regret it, bitch," she muttered under her breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora, sensing the tension, frowned and asked, "What's your problem? What do you mean by that?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="47.html">« Prev</a><a href="49.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
