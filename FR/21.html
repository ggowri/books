"You're hurt," he said softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora merely stared at the ground with a cold expression, </span><span>remaining silent</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who hurt you? Tell me, and I'll make sure they pay," Hubery said, his eyes narrowing as a hint of danger flashed across them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, his concern fell on deaf ears, as Aurora found it absurd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the one who had vowed to protect her but had also betrayed her by sending her to prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five years ago, she had pinned her hopes on him to be her defense lawyer in court.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he sat across from her as Bertha's lawyer, calmly presenting evidence that condemned her. Each word was a sharp blade, slicing through her heart and pinning her to a pillar of shame, stripping her of her freedom, dignity, education, and future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had once trusted him, but his betrayal had almost cost her half her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could she ever trust him again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Adolph was her greatest fear, then Hubery was the person she hated and despised the most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, they had depended on each other for more than a decade, but he so easily discarded their long-standing relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She envied Bertha, who also had a decade-long relationship with the Elvador family. The Elvador family was willing to sacrifice their own</span><span> kid</span><span> to protect Bertha, rather than let her come to harm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Aurora's silence and indifference, Hubery's face contorted with pain and guilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, are you still blaming me? I had my reasons for what happened. Will you forgive me? I promise I won't let anything like that happen again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Aurora was uninterested in his excuses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had endured too much already.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No amount of explanations could erase the harm she had suffered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her leg was permanently damaged, her left ear deaf, and her kidney gone forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cruel reality stared her in the face. She could never forgive the one who had inflicted such pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora tried to pull her hand away, but Hubery clung to it tightly, refusing to let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She finally looked up at him, her eyes as cold as ice, filled with disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze was almost suffocating as if an invisible hand was gripping his chest. Aurora's disgust and indifference overwhelmed him. She said coldly, "Let me go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's fingers instinctively tightened, his eyes locked on Aurora. "Aurora, let me take you to get your wound bandaged, please?" His voice was soft, almost pleading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to Aurora, it was just hypocrisy, deepening her disgust towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said let me go. Can't you understand?" she snapped, her disgust unmasked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery felt like he was being stabbed by a thousand needles, the pain spreading throughout his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking up, he saw her</span><span> resolute and cold face, his lips trembling as he struggled to speak her name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was filled with regret as if he was begging her to change her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But all he received in return was Aurora's deepening anger. She forcefully hit her head against the wall, her frustration and pain evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wound, which had barely begun to form a scab, promptly burst open, releasing a fresh gush of blood that flowed down her cheeks, giving her face a grim and harrowing appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Drenched in blood, she gazed at Hubery with eyes that reflected not pain, but a desperate determination. "Will you let go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery was paralyzed by her sudden self-harm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You refuse to let go, don't you?" Aurora forcibly slammed her head against the wall once more, producing a muffled yet haunting sound that echoed down the hallway, each impact striking Hubery like a blow to his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face paled, and he almost stumbled to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you insane?" His voice quivered. "Just to get rid of me, you don't care about your own well-being?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora seemed to have descended into a manic state, continuing to bash her head against the wall as long as Hubery held on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood splattered onto the floor, forming disturbing pools, and she grew pale from severe blood loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery was tortured beyond endurance by Aurora's crazy actions, the pain radiating from the depths of his soul to every fiber of his being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why don't you cherish your own body? Why do you torture me by harming yourself?" Hubery's voice was ragged and trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He forcibly embraced Aurora, as if trying to merge their bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was so absurd. If cherishing her body worked, she wouldn't be deaf and crippled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me go or I'll kill myself right in front of you." She struggled desperately, attempting to slam her head against the wall again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her waning strength, her stubbornness remained unyielding. Each struggle tore at her wound, causing blood to stream continuously from her forehead, cascading down her cheeks and dripping onto Hubery's arm. The warm sensation was like burning magma, scorching his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery stared at Aurora in horror. "Aurora, don't do this. I'll let you go right now..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's hands slowly released their grip, and the overwhelming reluctance felt like millions of ants chewing at his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's body swayed after losing Hubery's support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before Hubery could reach his hand to support her again, she regained her footing with tenacious willpower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't touch me. Stay away from me. I never want to see you again." Aurora's voice was cold and unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she limped towards the hospital exit, her shuffling steps sounding like broken drumbeats, each one striking Hubery's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't dare approach her again but couldn't bear to leave her like this, so he followed her at a cautious distance, taking each step in tandem with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora didn't want to return home so soon. Going back would mean enduring endless abuse from the Elvador family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she sat down on a bench outside the hospital, staring blankly at the cars passing by on both sides of the road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery stood not far behind her, gazing at her unblinkingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blood on Aurora's forehead was so glaring that it stung his eyes with pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he approached a passing woman and spoke to her. The woman first looked surprised, then nodded and hurried away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, she reappeared, holding a bag, and walked straight to Aurora, saying softly, "Miss, your head is bleeding badly. Let me help you take care of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked at the disinfectant, cotton swabs, and gauze in the bag, and her heart fluttered slightly. She glanced back and searched the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery quickly hid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora </span><span>looked around</span><span>. After ensuring he was not around, she smiled slightly at the woman. "Thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, </span><span>Hubery quietly stepped out and saw Aurora sitting obediently as the woman tended to her wound. While he felt relieved, his heart ached even more.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="20.html">« Prev</a><a href="22.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
