"Eight years have gone by in the blink of an eye! Our little angel has turned into a gorgeous young lady."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin eyed Aurora with concern. "You've grown up and gotten so slender. Haven't you been eating right at the research institute?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William spoke up excitedly, "Let's </span><span>go</span><span> home! We'll stuff Aurora full of good grub and put some meat on her bones!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora felt a warm glow spreading through her heart. "Okay, let's head home."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stretched out her hand towards Julian and called out, "Juli."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian flashed a soft, sincere smile and reached out his fingers to take Aurora's.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hand in hand, they waded through the throng of the Barron family and made their way towards the hospital exit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste had a million things she wanted to say to Aurora, but the words just wouldn't come. All she could do was stand there silently, watching them leave.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph wore a look that was part sad, part happy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some odd reason, he had this gut feeling that he and Aurora shouldn't be strangers.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, he was convinced there was a connection between them that went beyond just being casual acquaintances.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the cold, hard truth was that this was their first encounter, and Aurora didn't even have a clue who he was.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was a genius scientist, a national gem, adored by countless people.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And what was he?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, he came from a well-off family, but they were just in the business world.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt like he didn't have a leg to stand on when it came to getting closer to someone as brilliant as Aurora.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I know my place, but what's Julian's deal?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Hawke family is just a bunch of merchants. What gives Julian the right to go after Aurora?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Adolph ruminated on the situation, the more steamed he got.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he watched Aurora slipping out of his reach, he finally mustered up the courage to yell out, "Aurora, will we cross paths again?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camille, who was </span><span>well aware</span><span> of her brother's crush on Aurora, also knew that he wasn't really in the same league as her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But hey, they were both single. Who could say for sure that Aurora wouldn't end up as his wife one day?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A beaming smile </span><span>lit up</span><span> Camille's face. She was as dainty as a porcelain doll, with cute dimples and a set of pearly whites that sparkled like stars. She looked like a ray of sunshine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, you're my brother's idol! He's been dying to meet you for ages, and he's over the moon that he finally got to see you. Do you think you could be friends with him?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stopped in her tracks and sized Camille up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, if it hadn't been for Camille suddenly </span><span>showing</span><span> up, she would've been the one pushed down the stairs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camille took the fall for her, and out of gratitude for that, she just couldn't brush Camille off.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she couldn't agree to Camille's demands.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora only felt indebted to Camille. As for the rest of the Sherwood family, she owed them nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora gave Camille a little smile. "You can be my friend, but him?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She swiveled around to face Adolph and caught him looking at her with </span><span>puppy-dog</span><span> eyes, full of hope.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold sneer formed in her mind. "Not on his life."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those words hit Adolph like a ton of bricks. In the blink of an eye, all his hopes went up in smoke, leaving him feeling like he'd been punched in the gut.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just stood there, gawking at Aurora, desperately trying to find a shred of kindness in her eyes. But all he got was a cold dose of disdain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why? It's our </span><span style="font-style: italic;">first time</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> meeting!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What did I do to make her hate me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph was totally at a loss. He gritted his teeth and tried to swallow his pain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camille stood there, frozen, feeling the awkwardness in the air. She could tell that Aurora was warm toward her, but the iciness directed at her brother was as clear as day.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora didn't give Adolph a second look.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, they'd been </span><span>pretty tight</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then Bertha started whispering sweet nothings in Adolph's ear, and their relationship went down the drain. He always took Bertha's side and never believed a word Aurora said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, Aurora had zero interest in being friends with a guy who could be so easily led astray.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go," Aurora said, and started making her way out of the hospital with her family in tow.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought they were finally going home, but when they got to the hospital entrance, it was like a zoo.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reporters were everywhere. The moment they spotted her, their eyes lit up, and they were itching to get through the crowd for an interview.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, the bodyguards stepped in just in time to keep them at bay before they could mob her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William gave Aurora a wink. "Knew this was </span><span>gonna</span><span> go down, so I lined up the bodyguards beforehand."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks, William."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, sis. I'm your big bro. Looking out for you is what I do. No need to sweat it," he said, flashing a wide grin.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora felt a warm glow spread through her chest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett, her biological brother, had never had a clue how to protect his only sister. All he ever did was cause her heartache.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, </span><span>here</span><span> was a brother who stepped up and shielded her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they all piled into the car, Aurora piped up, "Mom, are we heading back to Putnam now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura gave Aurora's hand a gentle squeeze. "Not quite yet, honey. We </span><span>gotta</span><span> go and thank your savior first."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My savior? Who's that?" Aurora looked utterly confused.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasn't it Celeste who called the police?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had come to Orley, knowing Joshua, Isabella, and Bertha wouldn't just let her walk away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given her current standing, if they tried to do her harm, there'd be hell to pay.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, their false claims had landed her behind bars. This time around, she was determined to turn the tables and make them feel the same pain they'd inflicted on her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why Aurora had reached out to Celeste, hoping she'd tip off the cops the second she got kidnapped.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, was it Celeste who called the cops?" Aurora asked, her brows knitted with curiosity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura shook her head, a worried look on her face. "The police said it was a young fella who reported you missing and came to your rescue.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank God he </span><span>called the cops just in time</span><span>. Otherwise, you could've ended up having your insides harvested," Laura said, shivering at the mere thought.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura added, "Aurora, you nearly gave me a heart-attack! Do you even realize how terrified I was?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I get that you were </span><span>dead-set</span><span> on coming to Orley to see your birth mom. But you're only seventeen, for crying out loud! How could I ever feel okay about you traveling all that way by yourself?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="234.html">« Prev</a><a href="236.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
