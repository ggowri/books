"Things might not be what they seem. There could be some misunderstanding."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett ignored him completely, his bloodshot eyes fixed on the figures above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His chest heaved with rage as he snarled, "Misunderstanding? They're wrapped in each other's arms, and they're even... What possible misunderstanding could there be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tilted his head back, </span><span>shouting</span><span> </span><span>towards</span><span> </span><span>the window, "Aurora, are you that horny? Can't you live without a man?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the stillness of night, the sound of his grinding teeth carried far. His eyes blazed with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was missing a kidney, and her body was too frail to handle any intimacy. The thought of it filled him with a surge of uncontrollable anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett convinced himself that she was doing this deliberately, destroying her body just to make them worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he stared</span><span> </span><span>at the silhouettes in the window, veins bulging on his forehead, he shouted, "Aurora, I'm warning you&mdash;if you insist on being with Julian, don't expect us to claim your body when you die in his bed. The Elvador family won't suffer such disgrace!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upstairs, warm yellow light suffused the bedroom, </span><span>love swinging in the air</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's hand firmly supported Aurora's lower back, and his touch was both gentle and secure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's body was pressed against Julian's chest, barely a whisper of space between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through her thin nightgown, she felt the heat radiating from his body, her heart racing in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His distinctive scent&mdash;cedar mingled with a hint of tobacco&mdash;filled her senses, making her head spin as color rushed to her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Th-thank you," she whispered, her voice tinged with shyness and panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She made a weak attempt to push him away, but her hands seemed to have lost all strength, unable to </span><span>do so</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian squinted to study her intently as if trying to see her through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's eyelashes fluttered, and her warm breath ghosted across his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She showed no reaction to Barnett's thunderous tirade below, as if the words couldn't reach her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she slowly raised her head, her eyes met Julian's penetrating gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, she felt herself drowning in those dark depths. Her pulse quickened, and her face burned hotter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she fought to control her racing heart, her gaze dropped to his lips. "Mr. Hawke, </span><span>could you... could you let me go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian noticed where her attention had settled, his gaze intensifying. Instead of letting go, he pulled her closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's slight frame disappeared in his embrace, and her face nearly was buried in his chest. Only her wide, startled eyes remained visible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian rested his chin on her shoulder, his lips close to her ear as he asked softly, "Aurora, didn't you hear Barnett?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was deep and resonant, colored with genuine curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora remained silent, making no indication she'd heard him. The room grew so quiet that only their synchronized heartbeats broke the silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Julian confirmed his suspicion&mdash;Aurora couldn't hear. Her ability to communicate normally must have come from reading lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shock and anger flashed in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd reviewed Aurora's records thoroughly and knew with certainty that her hearing had been perfect before her imprisonment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Julian thought of the reports of her being struck repeatedly in prison, his breathing quickened with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held her tighter, as if trying to absorb all her pain into himself, his protective instincts surging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora felt the increased pressure of his embrace, her heart thundering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Questions flooded her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian was acting so strange today. Was it because he had feelings for her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment that idea took root, a sweet ache bloomed in her chest. But reality's cold truth quickly extinguished her fantasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at her scarred, weakened body, she knew she could never be worthy of someone as exceptional as Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flush that had colored her cheeks faded, replaced by an expression of profound loneliness and sorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian lifted his gaze to Barnett below, his eyes turning glacial, carrying a hint of challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Barnett caught that look, his fury nearly exploded. His finger trembled as he pointed upward. "Julian, I'm warning you&mdash;keep your hands off my sister!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's rage awakened something dark and mischievous in Julian. A wicked smile played across his lips, brilliant in the warm light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he turned and pressed his lips to Aurora's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time seemed to stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora felt </span><span>as if </span><span>electricity course through her body, her heart threatening to burst. Her hands clenched involuntarily as her breathing grew erratic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett witnessed it all from below. His eyes bulged as he launched himself at the door, pounding on it with all his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Open up!" he roared. "Open this gate! Julian, you bastard, get away from my sister! Take your filthy hands off her!</span><span> </span><span>Aurora, stop pretending! Julian's no good for you. He'll only bring you misery!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door creaked open as Ashley and Daisy emerged together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hope flared in Barnett's eyes when he saw Daisy. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please," he begged, "let me in. That bastard Julian was pawing at Aurora&mdash;he even kissed her! I'll kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley and Daisy exchanged knowing looks, undisguised joy spreading across their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a word, they closed the door and hurried to share the news with Beatrice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice beamed instantly. "Wonderful! Just wonderful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd worried that Julian was completely hopeless when it came to romance, but here he was, taking the initiative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't expected them to progress to kissing so quickly&mdash;their relationship was developing at a pace that caught even her by surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Locked out, Barnett refused to leave. He continued hurling abuse at Julian and Aurora above, completely forgetting his original purpose of visiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren observed Aurora's slight figure silently, confusion mounting in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Barnett's harsh, loud cursing, Aurora remained completely unresponsive. And Julian's provocative attitude was deeply unsettling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian maintained eye contact with Barnett and Darren as his lips traced slowly up Aurora's neck. His warm breath caressed her skin, deepening the blush on her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora squirmed slightly, but Julian's hold only tightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawke..." she whispered, her voice quivering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Julian, her voice was like a gentle caress against his heart, intensifying his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He loosened his grip slightly but kept his hands resting lightly on her shoulders. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking down at her, </span><span>he uttered with tenderness,</span><span> "You should get some rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora nodded and started to turn toward the curtains, but Julian swept her up in his arms before she could move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of surprise, she relaxed, allowing him to lay her gently on the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Throughout it all, Barnett's hysterical shouting continued unabated, but Julian paid it no attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He handed Aurora the milk, watching as she drained the glass under his steady gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Julian gave her a soft smile before returning to the window, fixing Barnett with an icy stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's yelling cut off abruptly when Julian appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two men locked eyes across the distance, and Julian's gaze was filled with cold defiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The color drained from Barnett's face. "Julian," he ground out, his voice trembling with concern, "Aurora's health is fragile. You can't touch her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Julian responded with a sneer. In one swift motion, he drew the curtains shut, cutting off Barnett's view completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett glared at the closed curtains, seething with rage.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="109.html">« Prev</a><a href="111.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
