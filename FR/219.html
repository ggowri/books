Please</span><span>,</span><span> let me explain!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly</span><span>, </span><span>Laura jumped in, cutting her off sharply.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's nothing to explain. You abandoned your daughter in an orphanag</span><span>e. Y</span><span>ou don't deserve to be called a mother. The way </span><span>your two kids</span><span> act, </span><span>all</span><span> arrogant and entitled, proves you were never fit </span><span>to be a mom</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And now, your </span><span>whole </span><span>family has turned my girl's birthday party into a mess. Once this party's over, I'm going to deal with every </span><span>single </span><span>one of you</span><span>!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Laura turned and carried Aurora away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste watched the</span><span>m leave</span><span>, her heart torn apart as she screamed hoarsely, "Give her back to me!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how desperately she cried out, no one paid her any attention.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to chase after them, but her entire body trembled violently,</span><span> unable to move.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears streamed down her face</span><span>. She felt she was losing </span><span>Aurora forever.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, it's all my fault. In my old life, I couldn't </span><span>see what was right. </span><span>I blindly favored Bertha and ended up </span><span>ruining your </span><span>life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now that I'v</span><span>e got a second</span><span> chance to make things right, I swear I'll protect you. I won't let anyone hurt you ever again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know I was wrong. I regret it so much. If only I'd </span><span>come</span><span> back sooner, then what happened at the store wouldn't have happened at all."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The memory of how she'd sided with Bertha without question and even tried to hit Aurora made her hate herself to the core.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze fell on Bertha, still motionless on the ground, and her eyes burned with loathing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It's all this little bitch's fault.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">She knew full well she wasn't Joshua's illegitimate child&mdash;she was Isabella and Frank's daughter&mdash;yet she lied to us all along.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And I, for the sake of this bastard, ruined my flesh and blood, leaving my </span><span style="font-style: italic;">real </span><span style="font-style: italic;">daughter disabled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This time, I won't let this little wretch off so easily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste marched over to Bertha and slammed her stiletto heel onto the girl's tiny hand, grinding it down hard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha's delicate little fingers were almost crushed beyond recognition.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp pain snapped her awake.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha's eyes snapped open to see a shoe crushing her hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked up and saw Celeste's gaze, filled with enough hatred to skin her alive.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mommy, it hurts! Please move your foot!" she wailed, tears and snot streaming down her face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't grasp why the mom who once treated her like a treasure now looked at her with such disgust.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the pain was too intense to think.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of easing up, Celeste pressed down harder.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of tiny bones snapping echoed through the stairwell.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Barnett also </span><span>came to.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Bertha's mangled hand and Celeste's ruthless stance, his eyes widened in </span><span>disbelief</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lunged at Celeste's leg, trying to shove it away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom! What are you doing to Bertha?! Stop it&mdash;you're hurting her!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste looked at her son, her heart aching even more fiercely.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their old life, Barnett had been just as guilty as her in hurting Aurora.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hated herself. She hated Barnett. And she hated Joshua most of all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Barnett defend Bertha like always, Celeste's fury erupted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She kicked him away violently.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blow sent Barnett sprawling, knocking the breath out of him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took him a long moment to recover.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom... What's wrong with you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears streamed down Celeste's face. "Barnett, did you know? Bertha is your </span><span>dad</span><span>'s illegitimate child."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Bertha wasn't Joshua's illegitimate daughter at all</span><span>, </span><span>but she saw no need to reveal the truth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She just wanted Barnett to hate Bertha, too.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">From today onward, this bastard child won't know a single day of peace.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Every </span><span style="font-style: italic;">pain</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> Aurora endured, Bertha will </span><span style="font-style: italic;">feel</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> it all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I want to see how those scum&mdash;Joshua, Isabella, and Frank&mdash;will feel when they watch Bertha suffer.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett shouted, "Mom, what nonsense are you spouting?!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not nonsense. Bertha is the lovechild of your father and Isabella, the director of Orley Central Hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barnett, do you know why your real sister went missing right after birth?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett frowned. "Wasn't she stolen?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste shook her head. "No. Your father took her and dumped her in an orphanage. Then he brought his bastard child home and made me raise her, fooling both of us."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bombshell left the ten-year-old Barnett reeling, his mind blank.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How... How could that be?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew the director of Orley Central Hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had never crossed his mind before, but now, he suddenly realized&mdash;Bertha did look strikingly like Isabella.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then where's my real sister now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's been adopted. By the Barron family. Today's birthday party is just for her."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?!" Barnett's shock gave way to excitement. "Then let's go to the party! I can't wait to meet her!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's expression darkened, guilt written all over her face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barnett... you've already met her."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When? I don't remember!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That little girl from the children's store yesterday."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Her?!" Barnett froze.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Memories of what had happened yesterday&mdash;and just now&mdash;flooded his mind, leaving him stiff and speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't unreasonable. He just always sided with family over fairness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Bertha had been in the wrong for picking on Aurora, he'd still taken Bertha's side.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that he knew Bertha was his father's illegitimate child, and the girl they'd bullied was his real sister, overwhelming shame and resistance churned inside him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste sighed, "Since we've wronged her, we must do everything to make amends. Let's go to the party now and celebrate her birthday."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before they could leave, a group of security guards surrounded them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing? Let us go!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dared to cause trouble at the Barron princess's birthday celebration. You've messed with the wrong family."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="218.html">« Prev</a><a href="220.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
