Honey!" He called out to Celeste a few times, but she was out like a light and didn't stir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a cold smirk spread across Joshua's face as he turned his eyes to Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora neither cried nor threw a tantrum.

I just got reborn, and now I'm going to kick the bucket?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the twinkling of an eye, Joshua loosened his hold and instead hugged her tiny body close to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Thank God he's not trying to off me after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, Joshua had dumped her, and here he was doing the same thing all over again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But unlike last time when her heart was broken, this time Aurora was kind of glad to get away from the Elvador family for good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as expected, Joshua chucked her on the doorstep of an orphanage, just like he did before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora kept her mouth shut during the whole ride, her big eyes following Joshua's every move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving her there, he looked down at her with disgust and sneered, "You little runt, whether you live or die is up to the fates."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he walked off without looking back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he was out of sight, Aurora broke down in tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cold of the late-autumn night seeped into her bones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she stayed quiet for too long, she might just freeze to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cries echoed in the stillness, attracting the attention of the orphanage staff, who soon opened the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing the abandoned newborn, they quickly scooped her up and took her inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And so, Aurora found herself back in the orphanage once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her previous life, she had no memory of what being this small felt like, but in this life, she had the soul of an adult in the body of a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to the other kids, she was remarkably obedient and well-behaved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides the occasional whimper from hunger or a wet diaper, she rarely made a fuss&mdash;she was, without a doubt, the quietest kid in the orphanage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of her demeanor, the caregivers adored her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a well-behaved child! I've never seen a baby who's so good&mdash;really, all she does is eat and sleep, not a single bit of trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"True, but it's almost too good to be normal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Definitely. She looks like a perfectly healthy little girl, so why was she left here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think there's something wrong with her head? For such a beautiful baby to be abandoned..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The caregivers crowded around Aurora, sizing her up from all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, one of them spoke up, "She never cries or throws a tantrum. When she's awake, she just gawks with those big eyes. What if she's, you know, a dumbbell?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, it does seem that way," another one chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, if she is, so be it. As long as she keeps her mouth shut, it'll make our lives a whole lot easier."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora heard them and just rolled her eyes in silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time flew, and a year passed in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The little girl they'd labeled a "dumbbell" really took everyone by surprise. Not only could she talk clearly and walk steadily, but she also knew all the letters the caregivers had taught her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This discovery sent shockwaves through the orphanage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I always thought Aurora was a bit slow on the uptake, but turns out she's a real brainiac!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For sure! I've never seen a kid as sharp as her. She's smarter than any kid I've ever come across."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right? I taught her some words, and she got them all on the first try. I'd bet she knows at least two thousand words by now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my God, we've got a genius right here in our place! If only her real parents knew, they'd be kicking themselves for dumping her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was perched on her little stool, deeply absorbed in a book.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every word the caregivers said rang clearly in her ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had no plans to play dumb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Aurora was deliberately showing off her skills, dead-set on finding a way out of the orphanage before her fifteenth birthday.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, her dream was to become a teacher and inspire young minds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This time around, I'm not gonna be a teacher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Adolph's got a point.

margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But if I can get into a research institute and become a top-notch talent that's good for the country, then those Elvador scumbags will think twice before they try to cause me trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smile appeared on Aurora's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This time, no one's going to lay a finger on me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left;

margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a brainy girl like her, the stuff they taught in kindergarten and elementary school was a piece of cake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time she was two, she'd sailed through the entire elementary school curriculum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The caregivers and staff at the orphanage, the director Hannah Kaur included, gawked at her like they'd just found a pot of gold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left;

margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The country was starved for top-notch talent, and a smart little girl like Aurora, who'd mastered high-school stuff at such a young age, was bound to stand out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Competitions were a way to spot the rising stars, and being the youngest contestant definitely put her in the hot seat for some special treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left;

And of course, Aurora wasn't exactly itching to get buddy-buddy with anyone either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Hubery's betrayal in her past life had left some deep scars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this new life, she steered clear of any overtures from him and hardly ever laid eyes on him, as her whole world revolved around her studies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when Aurora was lost in thoughts about Hubery, a basketball came flying out of nowhere and whacked her right on the head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force of the impact sent her crashing to the ground. Her head throbbed painfully, and she saw stars dancing in front of her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, you there! Fetch my basketball!" A demanding voice rang out from afar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora bit back the pain and turned to see a good-looking boy of around eight or nine, looking at her with a smug smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression hardened in a flash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What rotten luck&mdash;it had to be Hubery of all people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, they'd known each other way before this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Aurora had gone out of her way to avoid him, and now they were facing off for the very first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm talking to you! Are you dumb or what? Get my basketball right now!" Hubery barked, annoyance written all over his face as he stared down at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora eyed Hubery's smirking visage and couldn't help a twinge of disbelief at her past decisions.</span><br><span>How on earth did I befriend Hubery during my days at the orphanage?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Now that the rose-colored glasses are off, he's just a total creep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She dusted herself off, picked up the basketball, and started making her way towards him, step by measured step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery, with his nose in the air, wore an infuriatingly smug look. "Knew it!
