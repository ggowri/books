"Hubery, are you okay?" she asked, her voice quivering with faux concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could answer, she turned her anger on Aurora. "Aurora, I can understand if you hit me, but why would you hit Hubery? Do you know how worried he was when he heard you were hurt? He's been so concerned that he even came to the hospital with me. Is this how you treat people who care about you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words were laced with pity, her voice breaking just enough to sound convincingly upset. She looked every bit the innocent victim, while Aurora, in her eyes, was the unreasonable villain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora couldn't hide her disgust for Bertha's fake sympathy. The theatrics made her stomach churn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew exactly what Bertha was up to&mdash;using Hubery as a pawn to take aim at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once, she would have been devastated by Hubery's misunderstanding. Her heart would have shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But not anymore. Hubery meant nothing to her now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a casual flick of her wrist, Aurora raised her hand as though she might strike again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha shrank back, her face draining of color as she hurried behind Hubery, peeking out from behind him like a frightened rabbit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, you're going too far," she muttered, her voice shaky, though her eyes gleamed with a hint of triumph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough!" Hubery growled, grabbing her wrist tightly, his grip tightening with unspoken fury. "You've crossed the line. No one has to put up with your bad temper. If you keep this up, don't blame me for&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, Aurora slapped him again, cutting him off mid-sentence. The sound of her palm meeting his cheek echoed through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery was left dazed, his eyes wide with disbelief as he stared at her, struggling to process what had just happened. "Aurora Elvador!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally shouted, his voice laced with anger and confusion, but before he could get another word out, she slapped him again, harder this time. The impact sent his head snapping to the side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three sharp slaps echoed through the room, each one leaving a bright red mark on Hubery's once handsome face, his skin now bruised and the outlines of fingers clear on his skin. The polished, elegant image he once had was now gone, shattered in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stared at him with a cold, unwavering gaze. There was no fear in her eyes, only an icy resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trust she had once had in him, that bond they had shared, was now replaced with pure disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All those cherished memories, once filled with laughter and affection, had long been burnt to ashes by his betrayal after betrayal. What remained was nothing but a deep, seething hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who do you think you are?" she sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What right do you have to meddle in our business? I'm Bertha's sister. It's my right to teach my own sister a lesson. This is a family business. You've overstepped your bounds."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's lips trembled as he absorbed her words, his gaze filled with sorrow and confusion. His eyes clouded with the kind of helplessness that only came from losing something irreplaceable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, you... you hit me..." His voice cracked, heavy with unshed tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had grown up together&mdash;fifteen years of shared history.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always been there when others picked on her, stepping in without hesitation. She had shared her food with him when he was sick, the smallest gestures of kindness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, all those moments&mdash;those days of innocence&mdash;felt like they had vanished into thin air. Could she really just throw it all away so easily? How could she be so cold, so final in her decision? Had she truly stopped caring for him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was her Hubery, wasn't he? How could he now be nothing in her life?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of being an outsider to her was unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were supposed to be the closest people in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet all Aurora did was look at him&mdash;cold, detached, no emotion in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze felt like ice daggers, piercing through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her, Hubery's words were utterly ridiculous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't take a few slaps?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what about the pain he had caused her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she had needed him the most, he had sent her to prison, without a second thought, all for the sake of Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What had those five years in prison been like for her? Endless darkness and despair, each day dragging on like an eternity. And who had caused it all? Hubery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he really think she shouldn't strike back?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's eyes began to fill with tears, his face contorting in pain. He tried to read her&mdash;searching for even a glimpse of the warmth they had once shared. But all he found was cold, bitter hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha, standing to the side, felt a twisted sense of satisfaction. She had hoped for this rift between them to grow, and it was happening just as she wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But on the outside, she played the role of the concerned one. She reached out, pulling at Hubery's sleeve, her voice soft and comforting. "Hubery, please don't be upset. Aurora's just angry right now. She'll calm down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After calming Hubery down, she turned to Aurora, her eyes brimming with fake tears. "Aurora, please, don't be so hard on him. If you need to blame someone, blame me. I'm the one at fault. You can hit me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice cracked, sounding pitiful, as though she were the victim. Anyone who didn't know better might easily be fooled by her act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora scoffed, "Save the act, Bertha. I haven't forgotten a single thing you've done."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't going to deal with her now. Once she made sure Daisy and Lily were safe, once everything was in place, she would drag Bertha down into hell with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had nothing to lose anyway, with her body already broken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she died, Bertha was going to pay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's face twisted in disgust as she spoke, her voice biting, "Just the sight of you two makes me sick. Don't bother visiting me again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could you say that, Aurora?" Bertha tried to argue, but the sight of Aurora's raised hand stopped her dead in her tracks. Fear flickered in her eyes as the words caught in her throat. She quickly fell silent, but her eyes flashed with venom as she glared at Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery stood there, desperate to say something, anything. He wanted to bridge the gap, to say the right words, but he couldn't bring himself to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood frozen for a moment, before finally speaking, his voice hoarse, "Aurora, you're not yourself right now. I'll come back in a few days when you've calmed down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Hubery turned, and Bertha followed, leaving the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they were gone, Aurora finally let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is such bad luck," she muttered, her mood shifting from bad to worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She just wanted to get out of the hospital and breathe some fresh air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as she looked up, her gaze collided with a pair of cold, piercing eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man standing before her watched her like a predator stalking its prey, his gaze full of intimidation and pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took one deliberate step after another, moving closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's heart skipped a beat, her pulse quickening in panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Adolph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora thought, "What is he doing here? What does he want with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With every step he took, the distance between them seemed to shrink, and her breath became shallow, frantic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph was the one she never wanted to face, the one she couldn't afford to cross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cold, ruthless methods had left an indelible mark on her soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just seeing him now made her tremble involuntarily, her body reacting to the fear deep within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to run, but her legs felt heavy, like they were made of stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph stopped right in front of her, towering over her with a predatory gleam in his eyes.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="55.html">« Prev</a><a href="57.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
