The </span><span>officer</span><span>'s voice cut through the silence, sharp and crisp. He pulled out a notepad and pen, ready to document her confession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora slowly sat down, her hands involuntarily gripping the chair's edge so tightly that her knuckles turned bone-white. Her fingers trembled slightly, betraying her inner tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Walk me through the details!" The </span><span>officer</span><span> fired off his questions like rapid-fire bullets. "Who did you kill? Where? How? And most importantly&mdash;why?" His intense gaze bore into her, waiting for every single word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora took a deep breath, her voice low and gravelly. "I killed Brandon Zion, Cynthia Truman, Hubery Winston, and..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She paused, each name conjuring bloody memories. Lily's crazed expression flickered in her mind alongside the twisted faces of her victims.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each name she uttered, the </span><span>officer</span><span>'s eyes dilated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never imagined that this frail woman before him could have murdered four people&mdash;and with such brutal methods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He struggled to maintain his professional composure, but the shock rippled through his professional facade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you absolutely certain you killed these four people?" </span><span>He</span><span> pressed, searching for any hint of weakness in her tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora nodded, her voice steady and resolute. "Yes. They were all killed by me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>officer</span><span> began writing, his pen scratching against the paper. "Tell me why," he demanded, leaning forward slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora closed her eyes as if diving deep into the painful memories that haunted her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She poured out every single detail of the abuse she had endured. She recounted Brandon's violent assault, Cynthia's calculated betrayal, Hubery's treachery, and emotional wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She described the brutal beatings she suffered while imprisoned among hardened criminals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her account was brutally honest. Every word was the absolute truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By laying out the actual events precisely as they happened, she left no room for doubt or inconsistency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>officer</span><span> listened, growing more shocked with each revelation. His pen flew across the notebook, struggling to keep up with her devastating narrative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never imagined a woman could survive so many layers of suffering. Her traumas ultimately drove her to this point of no return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officer kept grilling Aurora, circling back to the same questions over and over, determined to confirm every little detail. When he finally wrapped up the interrogation, he closed his notebook and got ready to have Aurora detained for further investigation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that exact moment, she made her move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With lightning speed, Aurora pulled a bottle from her pocket. She twisted off the cap and, in one swift motion, emptied the entire contents down her throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The action was so quick that the </span><span>officer</span><span> didn't have time to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes went wide with shock. "What the hell are you doing!" he shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time he realized what had happened, the empty bottle was already on the ground, and Aurora's body had begun to tremble violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora knew that with how much Lily cared about her, there was no way she would let her take the fall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she stayed alive, Lily would do everything she could to overturn the case for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why she tried to end her life after turning herself in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as she died, all the blame would fall on her alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily, you're such a good girl. You have to live well&mdash;Daisy needs you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Julian, Madam Hawke, Ashley... don't be sad for me. Even if I don't die today, it won't be long before I do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least I can make my death count for something. That alone makes it worth it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A burning sensation erupted in Aurora's stomach, spreading like wildfire through her entire body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The excruciating pain churned through her internal organs, rendering the previous pain medication completely useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit down hard on her lower lip, but the agony still escaped between her clenched teeth, emerging as a low moan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A stream of pitch-black blood burst from her mouth, splattering across the cold</span><span> </span><span>floor in a horrifying display.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, a stubborn smile clung to her lips, laced with relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as she died, everything would finally be over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily would be free from the murder charges and could return to everyday life. Julian could forget this painful past and continue his career. Beatrice and Ashley would no longer worry or live in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone could move forward, and this was the value she would purchase with her own life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora closed her eyes, a tear trailing down her cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora opened her eyes and found herself in a hospital room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The area around her bed was packed with people, but her eyes immediately locked onto Julian, sitting motionless in his wheelchair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked pale, his eyes bloodshot and intense as he stared at her without blinking. When their eyes met, Aurora managed a faint smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tried to reach out to touch his face, but her arm went limp halfway there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, Julian grabbed her hand, pressing it against his cheek. His voice was raspy with emotion. "Why did you have to be so damn stubborn?" The words came out like a broken whisper, filled with pain and desperate love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked at the man before her, so worn down for her sake, and her heart ached with guilt. She whispered to comfort him, "Julian, I've only dragged you down. Promise me... when I'm gone, you'll forget about me sooner, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her words, Julian could no longer hold back his tears. They spilled down his face, one after another, uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His shoulders trembled slightly. The calm, composed man he usually was had been entirely swallowed by sorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You promised to marry me," he choked out, his voice cracking with despair that seemed to come from the depths of his soul. "How can you break that promise now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora weakly reached up, wiping the tears from his face. As her fingertips brushed against his cheek, a sharp pain stabbed through her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't cry." Even though the pain was unbearable, her voice remained soft and soothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Lily pushed through the crowd. Her eyes were swollen and red. Her face streaked with tears as she threw herself against the hospital bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, why?" Her voice cracked with desperation. "I'm worthless. I don't care what happens to me. You don't have to&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora suddenly clamped a hand over her mouth, stopping her from saying another word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, I killed someone. I already turned myself in to the police. When you mess up, you've got to face the music. My body's already breaking down, eaten away by sickness. I don't want to suffer anymore&mdash;that's why I chose to end it with poison." Her gaze was hard and unblinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily, being incredibly perceptive, immediately caught on to Aurora's true intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, no! This isn't what I want. I don't need you to do this," she protested, her voice breaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily felt all her strength drain away, her legs giving out as she collapsed onto Aurora's bed with a heavy thud. Her hands gripped Aurora's arm desperately, as if holding on tight could somehow keep Aurora from slipping away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body trembled violently, choked sobs catching in her throat. "Please don't die, Aurora," she wailed, tears streaming down her face. "I'd rather die myself than lose you." The raw anguish in her voice was unmistakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Drinking </span><span>pest killer</span><span> was always fatal. The toxic chemicals would irreversibly damage the lungs, leaving virtually no chance of survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily clutched Aurora, and the mere thought of losing her made her feel like a thousand arrows were piercing her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora leaned in close to Lily's ear and whispered, "Lily, this is it. Live a good life, alright? Don't let my death be for nothing. It's all I can give you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily stiffened, her whole body tensing up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Move on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How can I move on when Isabella and Frank are still </span><span style="font-style: italic;">alive</span><span style="font-style: italic;">?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="192.html">« Prev</a><a href="194.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
