"Who I marry is none of your business."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph furrowed his brows slightly and then let out a cold laugh that echoed ominously in the cramped storage room, carrying an unsettling, suffocating aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"None of my business? As long as Camille remains unconscious, your life belongs to me. So, what do you think? Is it my business or not?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, his hands tightened on Aurora's shoulders, as if he were trying to squeeze all the obsession of these years into a single grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp pain in her shoulders was unbearable, but Aurora gritted her teeth, forcing herself to endure, her hands trembling slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph's palm, still freshly bandaged, began to bleed again from the pressure, but it seemed like he didn't even feel the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was almost as if he were punishing both himself and Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, his b</span><span>lood seeped out, staining her clothes</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>F</span><span>or a moment, it was hard to tell if it was his blood or hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph despised this version of himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had once been deeply in love with her and had even planned to attend the same university just to confess his feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, all he could think about was their future together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But all of his hopes were shattered by Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five years had passed, and he thought he had gotten over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when he heard that she was going to marry someone else, the jealousy burned uncontrollably, gnawing at his heart like a thousand insects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he still like her? She had ruined Camille, she was a former criminal&mdash;she didn't deserve him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph stared blankly at Aurora, the emotions in his eyes slowly calming, eventually turning into cold indifference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes became as frigid as an ice cave in the dead of winter&mdash;no warmth, no compassion. His hand finally loosened its grip on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora curled up against the wall, and it wasn't until Adolph left the room that her eyelids, as fragile as a butterfly's wings, fluttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in the study, Barnett stood in front of his parents, visibly agitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, Mom, you know how bad the reputation of the heir of the Hawke family is. Why are you still pushing Aurora to marry him? No matter what, she's your </span><span>real </span><span>daughter. You can't let her be sacrificed like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua slammed his hand on the table, his voice booming. "Bullshit! What do you mean</span><span> </span><span>by 'sacrificed'? With her background, if she marries into the Hawke family, that's her fortune!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett looked at Joshua with an expression of disbelief. His lips trembled. "Dad, Aurora's body was already broken from the torture she endured in prison for five years. You want her to marry a psychopath? Are you trying to end her life?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just the thought of Aurora's frail, damaged body facing the unpredictable dangers of the Hawke family made Barnett feel nothing but anger and fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's face darkened, his eyes wide as he raised his voice. "If she doesn't marry him, do you want Bertha to marry him instead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett froze, his eyes instinctively turning to Bertha. He met her sorrowful gaze, and his heart ached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the idea of letting Aurora be the sacrificial lamb was just as unbearable. "But..." he began, hesitating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Enough</span><span>" Joshua interrupted, his tone softening slightly. "The auction's in a few days. The Hawke family is determined to acquire the land in the east district.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if Elvador Group and Sherwood Group team up, we're not a match for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that land falls into their hands, Elvador Group will gradually lose its commercial dominance in Orley."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua frowned deeply, his face filled with worry as he continued, "The government has already issued a directive to focus on developing the east district.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once that project is finished, the commercial heart of Orley will shift there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the Hawke family controls that area, they'll hold the economic lifeline of Orley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elvador Group and Sherwood Group are no match for Hawke Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The only option is to compromise and cooperate with them, and a marriage alliance is the best solution."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett clenched his fists, his knuckles white, overwhelmed with guilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste, standing by, began to sob quietly. "Barnett, we don't want this either. But the family business, the employees we have to support&mdash;we have no other choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think your father and I are sleeping easy these days? Every night, I can't stop thinking about what Aurora will have to endure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm her mother. I love her as much as you do. Yes, the Hawke family heir has a terrible reputation, but his family background is impeccable. The rumors may not even be true. Maybe he's not as ruthless as they say."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wiped away her tears as she spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett fell silent. He understood his parents' concerns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When family interests were at stake, personal happiness seemed so insignificant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was filled with a heavy silence as Joshua, Celeste, and Barnett all pondered the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Bertha spoke up in a choked voice, "Mom, Dad, I'm willing to marry the heir of the Hawke family in Aurora's place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent as all three turned to look at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha's eyes were red, tears hovering at the edge of her lashes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was clearly devastated, but she forced a smile, her voice shaking as she said, "If it will help Elvador Group, I'm willing to do anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've never been your biological daughter. The moment Aurora returned to this family, I should have left. But I was young, and I loved you both too much to go. Now that I'm older and can contribute to the family, I'm willing to marry for the good of Elvador Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She spoke with a maturity beyond her years, but her tears couldn't be held back any longer, her voice growing hoarse. "Mom, Dad, will you still </span><span>love </span><span>me after I get married?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste burst into tears, pulling Bertha into her arms, sobbing. "Silly girl, what are you saying? You'll always be my daughter, no matter what. I can't bear the thought of you marrying someone with such an unstable temperament. We won't let you do this..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the deeply emotional scene, Joshua sighed, his heart softening. He turned to Barnett. "Bertha is so understanding, so beautiful. We've raised her in our hands for over twenty years. Can you really bear to let her go through with this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha turned to him, her eyes red from crying. "Dad, I don't mind. If it helps the family, I'll do whatever it takes." She sniffed and forced a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more she acted like this, the more Barnett couldn't stand it. He closed his eyes tightly. "Aurora... would endure it all for us."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="39.html">« Prev</a><a href="41.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
