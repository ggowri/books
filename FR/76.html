He gently took the red rose from her arms and placed it on the nearby table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You must be hungry. My grandmother made this. Try it," he said, setting the thermal container on the dining table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignored, Darren grew furious. "Who is he? So rude and arrogant?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren scrutinized Julian, secretly awed by his commanding presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his ego and pride wouldn't let him back down. He puffed out his chest, trying to look all dominant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian just ignored him. He took out the food from the container, arranged it neatly, and then sat down in a chair by the window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was indeed hungry, but Darren's presence left her on edge, ruining her appetite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pale and anxious, she asked, "Darren, why are you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren had assumed Aurora would be grateful he brought flowers to visit her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet she seemed terrified, clearly unwilling to see him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His pride stung, and he snapped, "Can't I come to check on you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora lowered her eyes, thinking, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">In his eyes, I've always been insignificant. Every past meeting involved mockery. Why would I ever want him here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Besides, he's close to the Elvadors. If he knows I'm here, the Elvadors will soon find out too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Those maniacs wanted to sacrifice me by forcing me to marry the Hawke family's heir for the East Suburb project's profits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I almost gave in for Daisy and Lily's sake. But after learning my embroidery could fetch sky-high prices last night, I changed my mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The key is to stay hidden from the Elvadors. Once I buy enough time to earn money through embroidery and send Daisy and Lily away, I'll have no weaknesses left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Then, even if it means burning bridges with the Elvador family, I won't hold back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Distractedly, Aurora picked up a spoon and sipped the chicken soup without paying attention to the taste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing he wasn't welcome, Darren frowned deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Accustomed to flattery, he had never been treated with such disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then</span><span> he pulled out a cigarette</span><span> in anger</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could light it, a deep voice cut in, "Don't smoke here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's gaze held undeniable authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that,</span><span> Darren faltered but retorted, "</span><span>Who do you think you are, huh</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calmly, Julian replied, "</span><span>We&rsquo;re in the hospital</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting his teeth, Darren stuffed the cigarette and lighter back into his pocket. "Aurora didn't </span><span>mind it</span><span>. Mind your own business."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes darted toward Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora </span><span>uttered,</span><span> "I hate the smell..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren barked, "Aurora, who the hell is he? Why are you defending him? I've known you for over eight years&mdash;since when do you have someone like him around?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora found Darren's outburst baffling. She hadn't said anything offensive, yet he exploded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she stayed silent, Darren heaved angry breaths. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I came here out of kindness, but she not only rejects me but sides with a stranger. Fine! If she hates seeing me, I'll leave!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, </span><span>Darren stormed out furiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora anxiously called out, "Darren!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren, having just reached the doorway, halted but did not turn around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the urgency in Aurora's voice, </span><span>he was contended</span><span>, and his mood improved considerably compared to before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please don't tell my family I'm here, okay?" Aurora pleaded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren was not unreasonable. He knew Aurora had been wronged and would never aid others in harming her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone softened. "Don't worry. I won't tell them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a pause, he added, "I won't inform Hubert or Adolph either."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora finally relaxed. "Thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gratitude instantly dissolved Darren's anger, and his voice grew lighter. "Take care. I'll...visit you again when I have time." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ward fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's mood lifted, and her appetite returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She resumed eating while Julian sat by the window, reading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sunlight streamed through the glass, casting his tall figure in a golden outline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadows danced across his face, accentuating his sharp features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fingers lightly pinched the corner of a page, turning it occasionally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gold-rimmed glasses glinted faintly in the light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching this, Aurora </span><span>was somewhat touched</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the many people in her life, few had treated her kindly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd once believed Hubert, who grew up with her, was sincere. But reality had shattered that illusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wealthy scorned her poverty&mdash;the Elvadors, Adolph, Darren, and so many others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, Aurora had labeled such people as petty and cruel...until she met Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the most unique wealthy man she'd ever encountered. Julian was composed, reserved, and impeccably cultured, like a prince from a </span><span>fairy tale</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian seemed to sense Aurora's gaze and looked up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught off guard by his penetrating eyes, Aurora's breath hitched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not bothered</span><span> by her awkwardness, Julian asked softly, "Does the food suit your taste?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora snapped back to reality, her cheeks reddening slightly. "Madam Hawke's cooking is delicious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pursed her lips, recalling how she'd drunk two bottles of Julian's wine the previous night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora didn't know the wine's price, but she recognized the Rolls-Royce. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Someone who drives such a car must own priceless vintage wines. Yet I drank both bottles without leaving him a single drop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought flooded her with shame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't remember if she'd acted foolishly while intoxicated. </span><span>Meanwhile, she assumed she didn&rsquo;t behave that way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sincerely, she said, "Mr. Hawke, how much were those two bottles of wine? I'll repay you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amused by her earnestness, Julian teased, "Five hundred thousand dollars each."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora gaped</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So I gulped down a million dollars? That's enough to buy a house!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face burned crimson. "I... I'll pay you back anyway."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julian set his book down and studied her. Her mix of shock and embarrassment entertained him. "And how do you plan to repay me?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="75.html">« Prev</a><a href="77.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
