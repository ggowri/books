"Mr. Joshua Elvador hit Ms. Elvador."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Barnett had already noticed the bruises and wounds on Aurora's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bloodstains stood out starkly against her thin, pale skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his attention had been entirely focused on her severed finger, which seemed far more alarming. Compared to that, the rest of her injuries had almost gone unnoticed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and tried to calm himself. "Why did my dad hit her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy hesitated for a moment, her expression uncertain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that she didn't want to tell him. She was afraid Barnett wouldn't believe her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if she didn't speak up, Barnett would eventually hear a distorted version of the story from Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She finally spoke up. "Ms. Bertha Elvador said Ms. Aurora Elvador pushed her down the stairs. Your father was furious and whipped Ms. Aurora Elvador with a belt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing Barnett's furrowed brow, as if he were about to blame Aurora, Daisy quickly added, "Mr. Elvador, please let me explain. I don't think Ms. Aurora Elvador could have done such a thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To be blunt, since Ms. Aurora Elvador knew your parents were home, she wouldn't dare hurt Ms. Bertha Elvador, unless she was looking for a beating. Ms. Bertha Elvador is unharmed, while Ms. Aurora Elvador is covered in injuries. It breaks my heart just to look at her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy gently wiped away a tear from the corner of her eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett clenched his fists. Of course, he was pained to see Aurora so injured, but Bertha had always been well-behaved and sensible. He couldn't believe she would deliberately frame Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Aurora had a criminal record.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his shifting expression, Daisy couldn't help but add, "Mr. Elvador, you and your parents seem to have a significant bias against Ms. Aurora Elvador..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish, Barnett shot her a cold, stern look. "Daisy, you're overstepping."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze was so intimidating that Daisy's heart skipped a beat, and she quickly fell silent.</span><span> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">"I must be out of my mind, actually criticizing my employers. But what happened tonight is just too unfair to Ms. Elvador. Even as an outsider, I feel heartbroken for her. The Elvador family is just too ruthless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett paced back and forth in front of the emergency room, agitated and restless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what felt like an eternity, the emergency room door slowly opened, and the doctor stepped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett immediately approached him and asked anxiously, "Darren, how is Camille?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren removed his mask and said to Daisy with a serious expression, "Daisy, take her to the ward first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy nodded and wheeled the stretcher toward the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Darren and Barnett remained outside the operating room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Darren's grave expression, Barnett grew nervous. "Is Aurora's injury really that severe?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren shook his head gently. "Just some superficial wounds. Her finger has been reattached. It looks bad, but it's not that serious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank God," Barnett breathed a sigh of relief. But seeing Darren's continued furrowed brow, he felt something was off. "Why do you look so serious, then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren's lips twitched, but he swallowed his words, his eyes filled with an indescribable complexity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's unease grew stronger. He unconsciously raised his voice. "Just tell me straight. Don't beat around the bush."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren took a deep breath as if making up his mind. He looked at Barnett steadily and said, "When I was treating her wounds, I noticed an old scar about the size of a palm on her lower back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's eyes sharpened instantly. He knew Darren too well. Things were never this simple. "Be more specific."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren swallowed hard and spoke with difficulty, "Barnett, Aurora is missing her left kidney. Judging by the scar, it's about a year old. A year ago, she was in prison..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett felt his head buzzing as if struck by lightning. He froze in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Darren, his eyes wide with shock and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Darren, you've got to be joking. How could she have lost a kidney in prison? That's impossible. Absolutely impossible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren frowned and silently took out his phone, pulling up the photos he had taken. He handed them to Barnett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The photos showed a grotesque, twisted scar on Aurora's lower back, resembling a centipede crawling on her skin. The scar was dark and slightly wrinkled, with the surrounding skin slightly puckered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's face turned pale instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had been cut open and had a kidney removed in prison!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body began to shake violently, almost collapsing to the ground as if all his strength had been drained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren quickly reached out to steady him. "Barnett, are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett was in agony. He felt as if invisible hands were tightly gripping his heart, making it hard to breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, he was furious, almost grinding his teeth to pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With all his willpower, he suppressed the pain. After steadying himself, Barnett gently pushed Darren away and said in an icy tone he had never used before, "Darren, go check on Camille in the ward."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are you going?" Darren asked with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to find out who dared to lay a hand on my sister."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren patted his shoulder and turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett stood there for a long time before moving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His figure disappeared into the darkness of his car, with only the faint red glow of the cigarette tip flickering, illuminating his stern and gloomy face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mind raced back to the information Morgan had uncovered earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had visited a hospital a year ago. After that, she was transferred from her original dormitory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she had gone to the hospital because she had been forcibly operated on and had a kidney removed, her body would have been extremely weakened and unable to withstand beatings. That was why she had been transferred. It all seemed to make sense now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's breathing grew rapid, and his heart ached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly sat up straight and quickly called Morgan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Morgan, dig deeper into Aurora's hospital visit a year ago. Use any means necessary to find out which hospital she went to, what exactly happened, who took her there, and who she interacted with. I need all the details!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett gave his instructions and hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cigarettes burned one after another between his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't know how many he had smoked. He only remembered that he sat in the car for a long time before returning to the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing in front of Aurora's ward, Barnett hesitated to go inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he was wavering, Darren's voice came from inside the room. "Awake? How are you feeling?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was silence for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Barnett heard Darren say again, "Why is it that every time I see you, you're covered in injuries?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="28.html">« Prev</a><a href="30.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
