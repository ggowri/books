"Bertha, you're truly resourceful. This plan works. As long as we can please Beatrice, Julian's opinion means nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha smiled smugly, "But we need to </span><span>come up with</span><span> what gift to give her. It must satisfy Beatrice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua nodded but frowned. "The Hawke family is the </span><span>richest</span><span> clan in Putnam. They possess all kinds of treasures. It won't be easy to please Beatrice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Moreover, many other tycoons will attend. Their gifts may not be rare in the world, but they're certainly priceless. If we want to catch Beatrice's attention, it won't be easy either."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha chuckled, "We just need to cater to her preferences&mdash;she'll definitely like it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a pause, Bertha said, "Dad, I want to go to Putnam."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua immediately grasped her meaning. "You want to investigate Beatrice's preferences in Putnam?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha nodded. "No matter what, we must secure a share of the East Suburb project. Once this is settled, your position in the company will be solidified, and the board will trust you more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then, we can pressure the board to corner Mom. Maybe we can seize all her shares. By then, Elvador Group will belong to you and me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua agreed without hesitation, "Go ahead. This can also help you lay low. I suspect Adolph is already wary of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha </span><span>was on the same page</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph had stopped Camille from exposing Bertha, seemingly to protect her, but in reality, it wasn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Adolph has never liked me. He's always been obsessed with that bitch Aurora. He's afraid that once he learns the truth, he won't be able to face Aurora again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Once it's proven that Aurora isn't the one who harmed Camille, he'll lose his justification for hurting her. Then, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">he and Aurora will never be together</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another reason Bertha insisted on going to Putnam was to personally verify whether the Hawke family's heir truly matched the rumors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he was like truly a playboy, she would never want him even if he was ten out of ten. But if he wasn&rsquo;t, Bertha would make him hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Celeste rushed into the room in a panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face pale with panic and worry, Celeste demanded, "Joshua, how can you stay so calm while Aurora has been missing for so long?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua, interrupted from scheming with Bertha, waved impatiently. "She left on her own. The Elvador family doesn't need her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste, hearing these heartless words, felt as though she'd been plunged into an ice cellar. Tears welled up and streamed down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She choked out, "Aurora is also your daughter. How can you be so cruel to her?</span><span> </span><span>She suffered so much after </span><span>she went missing as a kid</span><span>. Don't you feel any guilt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua sneered mockingly, "Me, cruel? I should feel guilt</span><span>y</span><span>? Don't forget it was you who deleted the surveillance footage. It was you who destroyed the evidence proving her innocence. If we're talking about cruelty, I'm nowhere near you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste trembled, struck by his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears of pain and regret flowed as she sobbed, "I did it for Bertha. She was young and didn't mean harm. I just didn't want her to carry such a heavy accusation at her age..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So you're blaming me now? If I was foolish back then, weren't you just as deluded?" Joshua retorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha, feigning grievance, threw herself tearfully into Celeste's arms. "Mom, I didn't mean to. I regret it so much. If I'd known Aurora would suffer this much, I would've confessed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Bertha's distraught state, Celeste's anger softened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stroked Bertha's hair gently. "Bertha, I don't blame you. I raised you&mdash;no one knows your nature better than I do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha maintained her pitiful act, though her eyes glinted with scorn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sneered inwardly, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">What a fool. A few fake tears, and she's wrapped around my finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha glanced toward the hospital room door and locked eyes with Isabella, the hospital director standing outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both wore smug expressions, and Isabella discreetly gave Bertha a thumbs-up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This fueled Bertha's triumph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">This is what a scheme in the spotlight. Deceiving Celeste like this feels exhilarating&mdash;so satisfying and rewarding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua also noticed Isabella at the door, his gaze softening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Remembering Isabella's passionate demeanor that morning, he yearned for Celeste to leave so he could </span><span>make out with </span><span>Isabella.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smirked suggestively and nodded at Isabella.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella, thrilled by the secrecy, bit her lip and lifted her white coat to reveal </span><span>the </span><span>black stockings underneath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gesture ignited Joshua's arousal, making him itch to drag her away&mdash;though he restrained himself in Celeste's presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua impatiently said, "Fine, </span><span>stop crying</span><span>.</span><span> Or you&rsquo;ll make me sad.</span><span> I'll send people to find that troublemaker right now, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He picked up his phone, pretending to message subordinates about searching for Aurora. In truth, he was </span><span>sex texting</span><span> to Isabella, leaving her flushed and weak-kneed outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste remained oblivious to the interactions between Joshua, Bertha, and Isabella.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Still comforting Bertha, she sighed inwardly, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">How could any of this be Bertha's fault? Camille should've steadied herself, and Aurora shouldn't have been there at all. If Aurora hadn't shown up, Bertha wouldn't have needed to frame her. It's all about destiny.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="77.html">« Prev</a><a href="79.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
