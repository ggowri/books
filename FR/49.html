Just wait for your reputation to be ruined."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought Aurora wouldn't understand, but in fact, Aurora could read lips, and she caught every word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's pupils contracted in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, her body began to heat up, a fierce, insistent burn that surged in waves, each one more intense than the last, breaking down her last shreds of rationality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cheeks flushed an unnatural red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meeting Bertha's malicious gaze, Aurora's anger flared. She lunged at Bertha, her hands ready to strike, but Bertha easily sidestepped her, folding her arms with a mocking smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're feeling pretty smug these days, huh? Planning to marry Julian Hawke, are you? Let's see if he'll still want to marry a slut like you after everyone sees you strip naked in front of all these people. I'll make sure you're completely ruined in front of all the city's elite&mdash;everyone will witness how low you've sunk, haha&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The world around Aurora began to blur. The once-glamorous ballroom now seemed to flicker like a haunted place, its lights flashing erratically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heat coursing through her made her feel as though she should strip down and shed her clothes completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora clutched her arms tightly, her nails digging into her skin, hoping the pain would snap her back to some semblance of control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her panicked gaze swept across the room. The guests were all too absorbed in their conversations, oblivious to her distress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't lose control in front of so many people. She had to leave the ballroom immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Teeth gritted, Aurora spun around and rushed toward the exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Bertha wasn't done. She quickly grabbed Aurora's arm and shouted, "Aurora, Mom and Dad are over there! Let's go join them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she yanked Aurora back forcefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua, Celeste, and Barnett all turned toward the sound of Bertha's voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Spotting Aurora, Celeste immediately called out, "Aurora's here! Come over. I want to introduce you to Mr. Hawke."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's panic intensified. She couldn't stay here; she was about to lose control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The effects of the drug had already begun to take over her body. Her limbs shook uncontrollably, sweat beaded on her forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora bit down on her tongue, summoning every ounce of strength to wrench her arm free from Bertha's grip. The force was enough to send Bertha stumbling backward, crashing into a nearby table. The drinks and cakes on the table splattered across the floor, drawing startled glances from those nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amid the gasps and whispers, Aurora staggered away, ignoring the calls and scolding from Joshua and Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian watched the slender figure in the black suit stumble through the crowd. The sight felt strangely familiar, though he couldn't quite place it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't dwell on it, though. Whoever it was, clearly not someone important.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was nearly out of the ballroom when her legs gave out beneath her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't control her movements anymore, swaying and knocking over several pots of decorative flowers as she went. Behind her, a trail of chaos followed, but she couldn't afford to care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gasped for breath, desperate to find an empty place to ride out the drug's effects, when suddenly, a tall figure stepped in front of her, blocking her path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, have you been drinking?" Hubery's familiar, somewhat surprised voice rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned slightly and reached up, pressing his cool fingers against Aurora's burning forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment his touch made contact with her skin, Aurora's mind went blank. It felt as though the drug's force hit her all at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hands instinctively grasped his broad, sturdy shoulders as if searching for something to steady her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face grew even hotter, and her eyes, usually sharp and cold, were now hazy with desire. The usual clarity was gone, and she moved purely on instinct.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery froze at her sudden proximity, his breath catching in his throat. He instinctively tried to step back but found himself unwilling to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces were so close that he could smell the faint scent of soap on her skin, a sweetness that lingered in the air, pulling at his senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the soft, fine hairs on her face were visible under the dim lights, casting a glow that made her features even more exquisite. Under the drug's influence, she appeared even more stunning, more seductive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His throat tightened. His hand moved almost without thought, pulling her closer by the waist. Her body was soft, fragile, and he felt a shiver run through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, what's wrong with you?" His voice was hoarse, betraying a slight tremor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's skin was flushed bright red, her lips a deep, inviting shade. She radiated a beauty so intoxicating it was almost impossible to resist, like a rose in full bloom. The heat coursing through her was overwhelming, and all she could do was move closer to Hubery, seeking the coolness of his touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her breath came in quick, erratic bursts, the warmth of it washing over his neck, sending a shock through his system.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her presence was overwhelming, and his composure was beginning to crack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hand on her waist tightened, pulling her deeper into his embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The familiar scent of him stirred memories that Aurora had long tried to bury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His presence had once been a comfort, a warmth in the cold, but now it felt like a blade, cutting through the carefully constructed walls around her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, her mind cleared just enough to recognize him. Aurora's eyes snapped open, and with a force born of desperation, she pushed him away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her arm swung up, delivering a sharp slap to his face. "Stay away from me!" she hissed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hate and disgust in her gaze struck Hubery like a physical blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face drained of color, and for a moment, he could only stare at her in stunned silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened his mouth to speak, but no words came out. His throat felt tight and constricted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora turned, her body swaying with unsteady steps as she made a beeline for the elevator. Her movements were uncoordinated but determined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the elevator doors closed behind her, Hubery remained standing there, his hand still hovering where she had slapped him, staring after her in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elevator plummeted downward, and Aurora leaned heavily against the wall, gasping for air. The drug's effects were becoming more intense, and her vision blurred. The noise of the hotel lobby seemed distant, muffled, like it was coming from behind a thick curtain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she finally stumbled out of the hotel, the world around her appeared shrouded in fog, and everything around her seemed to blur in strange, shifting shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora felt herself losing her balance, her legs buckling beneath her, and she toppled forward into a strong, unyielding embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force of the collision sent her tumbling backward, but her hands instinctively grabbed at the man's collar, pulling him down with her. The force of the fall pinned him against the car, his cold, piercing eyes wide with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawke, the land in the eastern suburbs has already been transferred..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan was mid-sentence, his joy turning to stone as he watched Julian pin a woman against the car's hood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest of his words died in his throat, and he stood frozen, utterly stunned.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="48.html">« Prev</a><a href="50.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
