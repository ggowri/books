The engine roared to life, and within seconds, they disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That left Zoey standing alone at the bar's entrance, her face brimming with excitement and triumph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoey's manic laughter pierced the silent night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's gaze turned cold as she observed the woman reveling in her newfound wealth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoey sneered, "Unbelievable. All I had to do was rough up some useless woman in prison, and I got paid this much. This is way faster than making money through business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back when I was hustling, I couldn't even make 10 thousand dollars a month. But now? A million dollars, just like that. I'd have to scrimp and save for at least ten years to earn that kind of money. Who knew a five-year prison sentence would turn out to be so profitable?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more she spoke, the more arrogant she became. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sinister grin twisted her face. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too bad that useless woman got out before me. Otherwise, I could've picked another fight, landed back inside, and squeezed even more cash out of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But one million dollars should last me a long while. And when it runs out, I can always go back for more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You seem quite pleased with yourself." Lily's voice rang out suddenly, low and carrying an undeniable force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoey flinched at the unexpected sound behind her, and her laughter cut off abruptly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She spun around, her eyes sharp with caution, locking onto Lily with an intense glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell is wrong with you? Trying to get yourself killed?" she snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily met her gaze with a chilling calmness, completely unshaken as if she were watching a pathetic clown perform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoey shifted uncomfortably under her stare, feeling inexplicably irked. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression darkened as she scowled. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell are you looking at? Keep staring, and I'll gouge your damn eyes out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An eerie smile spread across Lily's face. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the dim light, that smile carried an unsettling chill, sending a shiver down Zoey's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never encountered someone like Lily before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before prison, Zoey had always been a troublemaker. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, she had thrived in the chaos, becoming one of the most feared inmates. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People either avoided her or cowered before her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Never had anyone dared to meet her gaze like this, let alone speak to her this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're really asking for it." Zoey gritted her teeth, her face twisting with fury. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lifted her hand, aiming a vicious slap straight at Lily's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoey's raised hand carried enough force to tear Lily's face apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Lily remained completely still, amusement flickering in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Zoey's palm was about to land, Lily swiftly pulled a knife from her pocket, the sharp tip aimed directly at Zoey's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sickening pierce, the blade sliced clean through Zoey's palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood gushed out instantly while Zoey let out a blood-curdling scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her arrogance evaporated in an instant, replaced by sheer agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily watched her with a smirk, casually twisting the knife still embedded in Zoey's palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoey's screams grew more desperate, her entire body collapsing to the ground as she trembled violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily crouched down, bringing her face close to Zoey's. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurting others must feel good, doesn't it? What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoey's face turned ghostly pale. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terror filled her wide, pleading eyes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shook her head frantically. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please... let me go... I was wrong..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily blinked, feigning innocence. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The contrast made her all the more terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let you go? Why should I? When you were torturing others in prison, did you ever let them go?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now you're asking me to let you go. This is wrong and very hypocritical."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without warning, she yanked the knife out. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood spurted from Zoey's palm. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoey's body spasmed violently, on the verge of passing out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily seized her by the hair and dragged her toward the dark alley nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoey's entire body shook like a leaf in the wind. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were filled with fear, and all traces of her earlier arrogance and smugness had completely vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could feel fear after all. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How ironic. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just moments ago, she had been boasting about the way she tortured Aurora in prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the tables had turned. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was the prey, utterly powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily scoffed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had expected Zoey to be stronger than this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that she was nothing more than a coward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears streamed down Zoey's face as she stammered, "What... what do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing. Just going to gouge out your eyes, cut off your tongue, deafen your ears, and sever your tendons. That's all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoey's body went rigid. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shook her head violently. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, no, please! I don't want that! We have no real grudge! Why are you doing this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily frowned slightly with an innocent expression, "Who says I need a grudge to do this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoey sobbed, "Please... let me go. I'll give you money..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily ignored her pleas, letting out an amused laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Money? I don't need money. I just want you ruined."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoey collapsed, her entire body convulsing as tears and snot mixed together on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was wrong! I know I was wrong! Please spare me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily twirled the knife between her fingers, the crisp metallic sound echoing in the silent alley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoey's eyes widened in terror. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She scrambled backward, desperate to escape. But Lily grabbed her by the ankle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing? No! No!" She kicked wildly, but Lily's grip was like iron. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't break free at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily gripped the knife tightly, her gaze remaining cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You wanted to gouge out my eyes, didn't you? Now, I'll let you experience what that feels like."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, she thrust the knife toward Zoey's left eye swiftly and mercilessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A piercing scream tore through the night, sharp enough to shatter the silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily didn't hesitate. The knife twisted within Zoey's eye before she yanked it out and drove it straight into her right eye. Blood gushed down Zoey's face, a crimson stream painting her pale skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoey writhed on the ground in agony, clutching her ruined eyes, her screams filling the alley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, it's your tongue's turn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily pried open Zoey's mouth, shoving the knife inside. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift flick of her wrist, the sharp edge sliced through flesh, severing Zoey's tongue in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A garbled, choking wail escaped Zoey's throat as blood spurted wildly, splattering across the pavement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Lily picked up a jagged stone and stepped toward her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tonight, I'll make you taste every bit of the torment you inflicted on Aurora in prison."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised the stone high and brought it down on Zoey's ear. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sickening crunch echoed in the darkness as Zoey's ear was reduced to a mangled mess of blood and flesh. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The world around her fell into silence, her hearing shattered beyond repair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoey's body convulsed before she passed out from the pain. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Lily wasn't done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She crouched beside her, the knife in her hand gleaming under the dim light. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With precise force, she severed Zoey's tendons, both in her hands and feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoey's body jerked violently, the fresh agony dragging her back to consciousness. A weak, broken moan escaped her lips. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the darkness of the alley, her wails echoed like the cries of a tormented soul, lost and doomed to eternal suffering.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="165.html">« Prev</a><a href="167.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
