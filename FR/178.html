He tightened his grip on Aurora and leaned in to whisper in her ear, "Aurora, it's been years, and you're still as irresistible as ever. Now that you're here, why rush off? Stick around and keep me company, yeah?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His warm breath brushed against the back of her ear, sending a shiver of disgust through her, goosebumps rising on her skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora thrashed against him, but James' strength pinned her in place, leaving her helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the door swung open, catching everyone's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing there was a woman in a flowing white dress, her long hair cascading down her back. She had a captivating yet innocent beauty, but right now, her expression was anything but gentle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes scanned the room until they landed on James and Aurora. Her face darkened, a mix of anger and disbelief flashing in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cynthia?" James hesitated, a hint of awkwardness flashing across his face before he quickly masked it with a practiced calm. He released Aurora and stepped toward her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cynthia, you're finally here! We've all been waiting for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Cynthia didn't seem to hear him. Her stare bore into Aurora, dripping with loathing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Edie and Samuel dumped her, she'd been on the hunt for a man to latch onto.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was her latest </span><span>catch,</span><span> one she'd worked hard to snag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd done her homework and knew he was just a sales manager now. He was not exactly in the same league as Samuel, the rich heir, or Edie, the local tyrant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But James had potential. Fresh out of university, he was already a sales manager at Hawke Group, one of the country's top corporations. That meant he had a bright future ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, he was in the middle of divorcing his wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman was an Orley native, loaded, and an only child. Cynthia figured once </span><span>James</span><span> split, he'd squeeze a fortune out of that woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With James by her side, she wouldn't have to worry about struggling through life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If James caught Julian's eye down the line, her life could skyrocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if James abandoned her someday, it wouldn't matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had a plan. While dating James, she would use him to get closer to Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her looks and knack for wrapping men around her finger, she was confident she could charm Julian easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marrying into real wealth might be a stretch, but cozying up to it was doable. Even a crumb from a rich guy's table could set her up for a comfortable and </span><span>luxurious</span><span> life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The problem was, in her current position, meeting Julian was a long shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she needed James to be her golden ticket, her stepping stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him, her carefully chosen ladder, wrapped around some "slut" sent her into a blind rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would make sure nobody messed with her plans and got away with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia glared at Aurora, teeth clenched, venom spilling out. "You shameless tramp! Hitting on my man? </span><span>You got a death wish</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora caught on quickly that this must be James' girlfriend. She tried to explain, "You've got it wrong. I didn't hit on him. He's the one who got handsy. You're his girlfriend, right? </span><span>Then m</span><span>aybe you should keep </span><span>him</span><span> in check."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia wasn't having it. To her, Aurora's words sounded like a sidepiece taunting the queen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She snapped, swinging her bag like a madwoman and slamming it into Aurora while shrieking, "</span><span>You</span><span> filthy skank! Steal my man? I'll beat you to death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora threw up an arm to block it, but the blow still stung like hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy lunged to shield her, but someone grabbed her arms and shoved her down onto the table, pinning her there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop it! Don't hurt her! Ms. </span><span>Elvador's</span><span> engaged. She'd never go after another guy!" Daisy pleaded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia sneered, her voice dripping with scorn, "Engaged, huh? And still, chasing my man? What a disgrace. Can't your fianc&eacute; keep you satisfied? A cheap floozy like you </span><span>belongs</span><span> on the street. There are plenty of guys who can keep you busy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her insults were vile, cutting deep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora tried to fight back, but Gavin grabbed her arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't forgotten how she slapped him earlier. Now, seeing her getting roughed up, he was practically giddy, his face lit up with schadenfreude. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Ungrateful little brat. I've got millions, so what's wrong with wanting a little fun? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, Aurora was just a broke ex-con. Offering her the chance to "serve" him was a favor. Watching her get humiliated, he felt she was getting exactly what she deserved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Gavin holding her, Aurora couldn't move. Cynthia's bag rained down, soon leaving bloody scratches across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy's eyes blazed red with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. </span><span>Elvador's</span><span> fianc&eacute; is the president of Hawke Group! You'd better stop now unless you want trouble!" she shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia froze mid-swing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room went still, everyone gaping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it wasn't fear that stopped them. They thought it was absurd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a beat, the place erupted in deafening laughter, loud enough to shake the walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The president of Hawke Group, her fianc&eacute;? Do you think we're idiots?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawke's worth hundreds of billions of dollars. He'd never look twice at a jailbird like you. You really think you're some kind of princess?" another mocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, know your place already," someone else piled on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They laughed hysterically, mockery dripping from every word. It took a while for them to regain their breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James cleared his throat, putting on a fake peacemaker act. "Alright, guys, we're all classmates here. Let's talk this out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia whirled on him, eyes flashing. "James, do you like her? Have you been messing around with her behind my back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved his hands frantically. "No, no way! I don't like her. I'm just saying this for old times' sake. Do you want to teach her a lesson? Go right ahead. I won't stop you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That lit a fire under Cynthia. She raised her hand, ready to slap Aurora silly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Stella stepped in, grabbing her arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why dirty your hands? I've got a cake right here. How about we smash it on her instead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Love it!" the crowd cheered, practically buzzing with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chaos broke loose. They reached for the table, grabbing handfuls of cake and hurling them at Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thick slabs of cream splattered her face, clogging her eyes, nose, and mouth, choking her breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sticky jam sprayed everywhere, staining her white dress red, and matting her hair into a gooey mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy screamed, her voice hoarse with rage, but in the madness, her cries were drowned out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pinned to the table, she could only twist her head, watching helplessly as Aurora took the brunt of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears streamed down Daisy's face, pooling on the tabletop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop it! All of you, stop!" she yelled, her throat raw, but all she got back was more laughter and wilder throws.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at her. What a mess! How hilarious!" someone howled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Teach her to act all high and mighty. Bet she gets it now," another taunted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They kept mocking and pelting her with cake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's body shook, every inch of her smeared with gunk. Humiliation and fury churned inside her, a storm ready to break.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, with a thunderous bang, the door flew open, kicked in from the outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The noise jolted everyone, stopping their frenzied attack in its tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy strained to look up, and when she saw who it was, a spark of hope flickered in her tear-streaked eyes.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="177.html">« Prev</a><a href="179.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
