The soreness was everywhere, and a sharp pain made her gasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With great effort, she forced her eyes open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first thing she saw was Ethan's handsome face, refined and striking, so mesmerizing that it was impossible to look away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily froze on the spot, her mind turning into a sluggish mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What's going on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why is Ethan in my bed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No. This doesn't look like my bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wondered if she was dreaming.</span><br><span>Maybe I have been thinking about Ethan too much and have ended up having a dream like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, reality hit her. She realized this wasn't a dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If it were, my head and body wouldn't be aching like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze slowly drifted downward, and in an instant, her breath caught in her throat. She and Ethan were naked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That wasn't all. His neck and chest were covered in faint bruises, even bite marks, clear traces of what had happened the night before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's body shook violently, and panic surged through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No. This can't be real. It's impossible. Absolutely impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Swallowing hard, she cautiously lifted a corner of the blanket and took a look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment she saw his bare body under the blanket, her face flushed a deep red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Did I really sleep with Ethan?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze darted back to him in a flurry of nerves. Ethan was still asleep, his features looking even more captivating under the soft morning light. But Lily had no time to admire him. She just wanted to escape quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moving carefully, she tried her best not to make a sound as she slipped out of bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her own clothes were ruined, stained with blood. There was no way she could wear them again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With no other choice, she grabbed Ethan's shirt and put it on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was huge on her, hanging loosely over her frame, but there was no time to be picky. She hurriedly dressed and tiptoed out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>About half an hour later, Ethan stirred awake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slowly opened his eyes, expecting to see Lily beside him. But the space next to him was empty. His brows furrowed slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lifting the blanket casually, his gaze immediately landed on a faint stain of red. He narrowed his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan stared at the hint of red, and vivid images of last night's intense passion flooded his mind. He let out a satisfied smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reaching for his phone, he dialed Lily's number, already thinking about how he would tease her once she picked up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how many times he called, the call wouldn't go through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan dialed several more times, but the result remained the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression grew colder. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled coldly, "Lily, you're really something. Using me and then blocking me afterward? What do you take me for? Daisy is at the Hawke Estate. I'd like to see just how far you think you can run."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the Hawke Estate, Aurora's days had been peaceful and fulfilling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her daily routine consisted of embroidery, eagerly anticipating the completion of her piece.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, she would wake up early every morning, wanting to prepare a nutritious breakfast for Julian, especially his favorite, pasta with cilantro.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Julian, always considerate of her health, firmly forbade her from tiring herself out. His serious yet caring gaze left Aurora with no choice but to give up the idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since she couldn't make breakfast for him, she allowed herself to sleep in every day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time she woke up today, Julian had already left for work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora sat alone at the dining table, enjoying her breakfast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Daisy approached with a cheerful stride, her face adorned with a warm smile. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Elvador, I'd like to take a day off tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked at her curiously. "Daisy, what are you planning?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy smiled as she explained, "Tomorrow is Lily's birthday. It's been a long time since we've sat down together for a meal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that it was Lily's birthday, Aurora was surprised. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's celebrate her birthday together tomorrow! Oh, and since it's her birthday, she should have cake. How about we pick her up from school this evening?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Daisy nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora picked up her phone. "I'll send Lily a message right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Lily was lying in her dorm room, bored out of her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How did I end up sleeping with Ethan in such a dazed state?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No matter how good-looking he is, that is no excuse for me to lose control like that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mere thought of her drunken self clinging to Ethan last night made her so embarrassed that she wanted to bury herself alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, her phone chimed with a new message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily picked it up and saw that it was from Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora: [Lily, Daisy and I will pick you up after school today.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily was stunned.</span><br><span>Why is Aurora suddenly coming to pick me up with my mom?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily frowned in confusion, a hint of unease settling in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Are they planning to take me to the Hawke Estate?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No way. If I ran into Ethan, the awkwardness would kill me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily: [Where are we going? What for?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora: [To a restaurant, for birthday cake.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily: [Birthday cake? Aurora, didn't you already celebrate your birthday?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon reading the message, Aurora couldn't help but chuckle. She turned to Daisy and said, "Daisy, look at this silly girl. She's been so focused on her studies that she forgot her own birthday!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy glanced at the message and laughed, "She takes after you, so studious and well-behaved. She never gives me any trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily was sweet, kind-hearted, and hardworking. Ever since she got into Orley University of Technology, she had won scholarships every year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All Aurora wished for was for Lily to live a happy life. But she also hoped Lily wouldn't be too naive and kind; otherwise, she might end up being taken advantage of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora: [Silly girl, tomorrow is your birthday. Did you forget?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily was stunned. She really had forgotten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Spending her birthday with Aurora made her instantly happy. Without hesitation, she replied [Alright, see you tonight.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That little surprise lifted her mood significantly, and just like that, she completely pushed aside the fact that she had slept with Ethan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So what if I had slept with a gay guy? It isn't a big deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, she wasn't the only one who had been wild last night. Ethan had been even more enthusiastic than her. Her waist was still sore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Thinking about it this way, neither of us took advantage of the other. Honestly, I was already being generous by not minding that he's gay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as she thought about that, a wave of discomfort crept over her, making her feel like she had been contaminated by something filthy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a jolt, she rolled off the bed, grabbed her toiletries, and rushed into the bathroom. She needed to scrub herself clean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As night fell, Aurora carefully dressed up before heading out with Daisy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as they reached the front door, they ran into Julian and Ethan, who had just returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian stopped in his tracks, momentarily stunned when he saw Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was wearing an elegant tweed jacket, paired with light blue jeans and crisp white shoes. Her hair was carefully styled, and her face was adorned with light makeup, making her look beautiful and full of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's gaze locked onto her, his expression unreadable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's getting dark. Where are you going?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora smiled, "Tomorrow is Lily's birthday. Daisy and I are taking her out for cake tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Ethan raised his eyebrows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Elvador, Daisy, why don't I drive you there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Lily, I bet you didn't see this coming. We'll be meeting again so soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">After what happened last night, I can't wait to hear your explanation.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="168.html">« Prev</a><a href="170.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
