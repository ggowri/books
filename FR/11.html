"Aurora, why are you in your brother's bed?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Aurora froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Brother? Barnett?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He doesn't even like me. Why did he bring me here?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">For three years at </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Elvador</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> Villa, Bertha could waltz into his room, but I was never allowed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Joshua and Celeste looked around, frowning. No sign of Barnett anywhere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Joshua looked at Aurora with a sullen face and asked, "Where's Barnett?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Aurora shot him a cold look and stayed silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She got out of bed slowly, limping toward the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Joshua and Celeste were blocking her path.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When they didn't move, Aurora frowned slightly. "Excuse me, can you step aside?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Joshua was already fuming about the Sherwood and Elvador deal falling through.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Now, Aurora's indifference only made it worse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He snapped, "I'm your father. Is this how you treat me? Who taught you these bad manners?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Celeste quickly tried to calm him down. "Joshua, don't be so hard. Talk to her nicely."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Joshua snorted, "Then you ask her why she's in Barnett's room. She's in her twenties, not a kid. First day back and already causing trouble. Even if it's her brother, she can't just sleep in his bed, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm being tough for her own good. Why don't I scold Bertha? Because she wouldn't pull something like this. Who knows what Aurora's up to? Maybe..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Okay, enough," Celeste hurriedly interrupted him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even though Joshua didn't finish his words, anyone could guess what he was going to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Aurora's heart ached.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She knew the Elvadors didn't like her, but she never expected Joshua to think so lowly of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Barnett was her brother&mdash;what kind of ulterior motive could she have?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Only someone truly despicable would suggest that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Aurora lowered her eyes, masking her hurt. When she looked up, her face was calm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She said, "Are you done? If so, please move aside. I want to leave."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Joshua was so angry that his chest heaved. He stood there motionless, his eyes becoming colder and more menacing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Celeste looked even more worried. "Aurora, why are you so stubborn? Just tell Joshua where Barnett has gone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I don't know." With that, Aurora tried to squeeze past them sideways.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, her arm was grabbed by a cold, large hand and forcefully yanked backward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Aurora fell to the floor instantly. Her injured leg was twisted again, and the pain was so intense that she couldn't get up, lying prone on the floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Celeste exclaimed, "Joshua, you're crazy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Explain it, or just stay here," shouted Joshua.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Aurora fought through the pain and looked up, locking eyes with Joshua.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The malice in his stare was chilling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He didn't see her as his daughter, more like prey he could toy with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She hated this look and couldn't help but want to escape.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Aurora slowly stood up, using her hands to support herself, and forced herself to remain calm. "I don't know where Mr. Elvador is. Instead of asking me, you might as well call him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes, let's call him." Celeste quickly dialed Barnett's phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The next second, they heard the phone ringing coming from the study next to the bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Joshua and Celeste exchanged a look and then rushed towards the study.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As soon as they opened the door, a strong smell of alcohol hit them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They turned on the light and saw Barnett sitting on the floor with his back against the wall, surrounded by empty wine bottles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Frowning at the sudden light, Barnett slowly opened his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing this, Joshua got even angrier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He pointed at Barnett, shouting, "Look at the mess you've become."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Barnett casually shook the wine bottle in his hand. Finding it empty, he tossed it aside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Joshua was livid. "Why did you end the deal with the Sherwood Group? They're a key partner! Plus, Adolph and Bertha are engaged. Did you think about the company or Bertha when you did this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Barnett smirked, his voice hoarse and drunk. "Did Adolph think about any of that when he had people torment Aurora?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What are you talking about?" Joshua asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Barnett sneered, struggling to stand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He said, "Adolph got inmates to beat Aurora, slap her, force her to kneel, pour toilet water down her throat, and stab her with needles. Do you know why her leg's lame? Because it was broken."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As he listed this one by one, Joshua and Celeste's eyes widened in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's impossible," said Joshua.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Barnett tapped his phone a few times. The next second, Joshua and Celeste's phones rang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Take a look. This is the information Morgan found," said Barnett.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The materials laid bare the harsh treatment Aurora faced in prison with cold text and shocking photos. Celeste covered her mouth, tears in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Joshua's face turned complicated. He frowned and finally said, "Barnett, you acted too rashly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Barnett looked up, stone-faced. "Should I have just let my sister get beaten?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Joshua was silent for a while, then sighed, "It's like hurting them but also harming ourselves. Ending the partnership doesn't help Elvador Group."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As if to prove his words, his phone rang immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After answering the call, Joshua's expression turned even more terrible. "Barnett, because of your decision, Elvador Group has lost one billion dollars."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Barnett's expression changed, and his lips trembled slightly. But in the end, he just pressed his lips tightly together, remaining silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Celeste, who was beside them, was already in a panic. She paced anxiously, rubbing her hands constantly. "What should we do? What can we do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Joshua slowly exhaled. "The only way is to resume the cooperation with the Sherwood Group."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, he dialed Adolph's phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The moment the call connected, the air in the study seemed to freeze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Joshua's expression changed constantly as the call went on. His brows furrowed and then relaxed at times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Finally, the call ended, and Joshua slowly put down his phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing this, Celeste asked with a trembling expectation in her voice, "What did Adolph say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Joshua answered, "He said that we can resume the cooperation, but he demands that Aurora go to the hospital tomorrow and apologize to his sister in person."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just then, Bertha's voice suddenly sounded. "Aurora, it's so late. What are you doing standing outside Barnett's study?"</p><div class="pagination"><a href="10.html">« Prev</a><a href="12.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
