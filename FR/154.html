Are you hungry? I'll make you some pasta right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora shook her head. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not hungry. I just want to make breakfast for Mr. Hawke and Madam Hawke myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been staying here, and there's not much I can do to help. This is the least I can do to contribute."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy chuckled and waved her off, "Oh, no need for you to lift a finger, Ms. Elvador. I've got it covered. Breakfast will be ready soon. Out you go now. The kitchen's full of smoke and grease."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She started nudging Aurora toward the door, but Aurora grabbed her arm, swaying it playfully. "Daisy, Mr. Hawke and Madam Hawke have been so good to me, and I've got no way to repay them. This is all I can do for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Teach me how to make your pasta, please? Yours are the tastiest, the most fragrant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she rested her head on Daisy's shoulder, nuzzling close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy melted at the affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, alright, I'll teach you," she said, grinning. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I bet Mr. Hawke will feel the warmth from his stomach to his heart when he eats what you've made."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's cheeks flushed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I knew you were the best, Daisy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her sweet words hit Daisy right in the heart, and she beamed, eyes crinkling with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And so, the two of them got to work in the kitchen together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>About half an hour later, five steaming plates of pasta were ready, the aroma wafting through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pasta sat neatly in the white plates, each topped with a golden fried egg and garnished with vibrant green scallions and cilantro. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few drops of olive oil added the finishing touch. Just looking at them was enough to whet anyone's appetite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right then, Julian, Beatrice, and Ashley strolled into the dining room one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy beamed proudly. "Mr. Hawke, Madam Hawke, come try this. Ms. Elvador made these herself for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice and Ashley turned to Aurora with warm, loving smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, Aurora, you're so thoughtful! I adore pasta, and look at this! It's got to be delicious," Beatrice exclaimed, her grin wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley nodded eagerly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely! The smell alone is amazing. It's got to taste even better. Aurora, you could open a pasta shop with skills like these!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy puffed up with pride. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right? That's what I said! It's her first time making pasta, and they're almost better than mine after decades of practice. What can I say? Ms. Elvador is just that clever. Everything she does turns out perfect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly!" Beatrice chimed in. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why else would I pick Aurora as Julian's wife at first sight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three women chattered away, piling praise on Aurora until she felt like she was floating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's face turned bright red from all the compliments. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought they were exaggerating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madam Hawke, Ashley, come try my cooking. If you like it, I'll make it for you often," she said, beckoning them over. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she turned to Julian, her eyes brimming with anticipation. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawke, you try it too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's gaze landed on the small sprinkle of cilantro atop the noodles. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His brow furrowed almost imperceptibly, but he said nothing. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he quietly sat down and began eating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora watched him, her heart fluttering with nerves and anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bold cilantro flavor hit Julian's tongue, and for a man who usually kept his cool, his face stiffened just a bit. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, he forced it down, swallowing the bite before offering a small smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's good," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?" Aurora's eyes lit up instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, really."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as you like it, Mr. Hawke," she said, beaming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora couldn't believe it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her first attempt at pasta had earned such high praise.</span><br><span>Guess I'm pretty good at cooking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling delighted, she picked up her fork and dug in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rich aroma of the pasta mingled with the scent of cilantro and olive oil, made her squint happily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how many times she ate it, pasta was still her favorite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe it was because, during her darkest winter, Daisy's pastas had warmed her through the cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whenever the weather turned cold, she found herself craving that taste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora ate with joy, oblivious to the fact that Beatrice and Ashley were staring wide-eyed at Julian as he ate as if witnessing something unbelievable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two exchanged a glance, seemingly wanting to say something. But seeing Aurora's cheerful expression, they swallowed their words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's health was poor, and her stomach had been damaged during her time with the Elvador family, so she ate slowly. By the time she finished savoring a single bite, she looked up to find Julian had already polished off his entire plate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes widened in surprise, but her heart swelled with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawke, would you like more? I can make you more," she offered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian quickly replied, "No need. I have work to attend to today. Take your time eating."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood and turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora hurriedly added, "Mr. Hawke, take Daniel with you. I'm not going out today, and I'll feel better knowing he's with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright," Julian replied, striding out the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the car, Julian leaned back in his seat, looking worn out. He loosened his tie, revealing a rash spreading across his neck and chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel, who was driving, caught sight of this in the rearview mirror and exclaimed, "Mr. Hawke, did you eat cilantro?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel knew full well that Julian was allergic to cilantro. Even a tiny bit would cause his body to break out in dense red rashes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian let out a heavy breath. "Find a pharmacy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back at the Hawke Estate, after breakfast, Aurora turned to Beatrice. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madam Hawke, I'm heading out with Daisy in a bit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't you just say you weren't going anywhere today?" Beatrice asked, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had said that to Julian, but it was a little trick to get Daniel out of the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she stepped outside, he would stick to her like glue otherwise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily just called. There's a school event that needs a parent to join, so I thought I'd go with Daisy to check it out," she explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, I see," Beatrice said, nodding. A school visit sounded safe enough, so she agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they left the Hawke Estate, Daisy looked confused. "Ms. Elvador, why did you lie to Madam Hawke just now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's face grew serious. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daisy, I want to go to the hospital for a full checkup."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy's eyes lit up. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's great news!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then she noticed Aurora's expression growing even heavier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daisy, I know my body. If something's wrong, I don't want Madam Hawke or Mr. Hawke to worry. They've already done so much for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze dropped, her voice tinged with sorrow. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I hadn't met Mr. Hawke, I wouldn't even have had the chance to settle my scores.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And Madam Hawke has been so determined to pair me with Mr. Hawke, but how could someone as broken as me be worthy of him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought about it all night. If I can get better, that'd be perfect. But if I can't, I don't want to hold Mr. Hawke back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy's heart ached at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Life had thrown so much at Aurora, yet she still held onto a kind, grateful soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright," Daisy said softly. "I'll go with you to the hospital."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="153.html">« Prev</a><a href="155.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
