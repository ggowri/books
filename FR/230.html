Disappeared for eight years and still managed to crawl back alive."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora remained poker-faced. His cruel words didn't even ruffle her feathers.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her, Barnett was like dirt under her feet&mdash;too </span><span>lowly</span><span> to even spare a second look.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett got ticked off by her total indifference. His forehead veins popped, and he balled his fists.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he turned to Celeste and said, "See? I told you she's a cold-hearted, ungrateful brat. You go out of your way to care about her, and she couldn't care less about you.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I seriously don't get it. Why are you so stuck on her? You never even raised her, but all you can think about is blood relations. Is </span><span>it </span><span>really </span><span>that important</span><span>?</span><span> </span><span>What the heck does she have that Bertha doesn't?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zip it!" Celeste barked, seething with rage.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Barnett wasn't about to back down. "</span><span>What? I'm just telling the truth</span><span>. She's exactly how I described her. Can't I even speak my mind?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>You&mdash;"</span><span> Celeste was so mad she wished she could gag him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett had always been a real smart-aleck.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their past life, he was the one who gave Aurora the most grief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But </span><span>today</span><span> was a whole new </span><span>ballgame&mdash;</span><span>Aurora didn't bat an eyelid.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora turned to Celeste and said, "I've got something I </span><span>wanna</span><span> talk to you about."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's eyes popped wide in surprise. "Oh! Sure thing. Let's head to </span><span>the study</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, they made their way upstairs, leaving </span><span>the </span><span>fuming Barnett behind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He roared after Aurora, "Who do you think you are? Get the hell </span><span>outta</span><span> my house right now!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was as cool as a cucumber.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her nonchalance just rubbed him the wrong way even more.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, I'm talking to you! Are you deaf or something?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The word "deaf" made Aurora stop in her tracks for a split second.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She loathed being called that. In her past life, Aurora really had been deaf, a lousy result of the violence she'd suffered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The suffocating silence of that world still gave her the creeps, and she swore she'd never be that helpless again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calm as ever, she retorted, "Ms. Jerome, your way of raising kids is still as useless as ever."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's face went red with a mix of shame and anger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gave Barnett a cold look. "If you don't cut it out, you can get out of this house and don't ever come back."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then turned to Aurora. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, let's just ignore him," Celeste said, reaching out to grab Aurora's hand, but Aurora dodged her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's hand hung there awkwardly before she pulled it back, </span><span>and she looked </span><span>embarrassed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then they both went into the study.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, are you thirsty? What do you feel like drinking? I'll go get it for you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, don't bother. I've never been good enough for anything in this house anyway."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste felt like someone had stabbed her in the heart. "I'm so sorry, truly."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're really sorry, then do me a favor."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's eyes went wide. "What is it? I'll do whatever I can</span><span>. N</span><span>o questions asked."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora sized Celeste up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under that skeptical look, Celeste felt a twinge in her chest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, trust me. I won't lie to you this time."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora said, "Alright, I'll give you one more shot, but that's it. If you can pull this off, we'll call it square for all the crap that happened in the past."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For real?" Celeste was over the moon with excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, but this is your only shot."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay! You have my word!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora plopped down in a chair and then, taking her sweet time, </span><span>and </span><span>said, "By now, I bet Bertha's kidneys are starting to go south, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste froze for a moment, thrown off by Aurora's abrupt question.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Um, yeah," she murmured, keeping to herself the fact that Bertha's kidney problems had cropped up earlier this time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their previous life, Bertha had been the apple of the family's eye. She was spoiled rotten and doted on, with every aspect of her health carefully monitored.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, things were a whole new </span><span>ballgame</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her past-life memories resurfacing, Celeste had turned into a real tyrant. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd often chew Bertha out, starve her, and punish her by making her stand outside, whether it was the scorching sun or pouring rain, or force her out in the freezing cold during winter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hell that Aurora had gone through in her past life was now being heaped on Bertha.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gone was the tall, vibrant girl she used to be. Bertha had become a shadow of herself, weak and wasted, and it was obvious that her health was going downhill fast.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua, seeing his precious daughter suffer, was boiling with anger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was as helpless as a kitten. After the downfall of </span><span>Elvador</span><span> Group, he was just a middle-aged man with no job and no place to call home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Celeste also took a hit from the company's collapse, she still had her marital assets to fall back on.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This villa was in Celeste's name, which meant she could stay put in her house and still had a decent nest egg.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she hadn't fallen head over heels for Joshua, she might have made a name for herself in the business world. After all, her dad was a big-shot businessman in Orley.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wealthy father backing her up and her own smarts, she was bound to make something of herself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she had been too love-struck and naive enough to believe Joshua's lies, nearly leading to her ruin.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with her awakened memories, she despised him and wanted nothing more than to divorce him and kick him out of the house.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Joshua's stubbornness rivaled the strongest of walls; he refused to grant the divorce.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Left with no other choice, Celeste initiated legal proceedings, demanding that </span><span>Joshua walk</span><span> away with nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Naturally, he objected, dragging out the court battles until finally, last year, they divorced, and Celeste ejected both Joshua and Bertha from the villa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even then, Barnett had been secretly supporting them, which led to the current explosive situation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the years, Celeste's treatment of Bertha had been nothing short of brutal, and her kidney issues had long since manifested.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they were desperately searching for a suitable donor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's voice was calm as she remarked, "In my past life, Joshua and Bertha plotted to steal my kidney. Given their character, if they can't find a suitable match this time, they'll likely set their sights on me again."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's face turned pale with a sudden surge of protective fury.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Aurora. I won't let history repeat itself."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora said, "No, I want them to come after me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste exclaimed, shocked and perplexed. "Aurora, why would you want that?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora wore a cold smile. "In my past life, I couldn't protect myself. This time, my situation is different. I'm a top-tier scientific talent being cultivated by the state.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just think&mdash;if Joshua and Bertha managed to abduct and harm me, what would happen when the government found out? Their fate wouldn't be pretty.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll let you in on a little secret; I developed </span><span>the holographic</span><span> technology, and my research has reached crucial milestones. Soon, </span><span>Peloland</span><span> will be transitioning into the era of </span><span>IntelliBrain</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>Now imagine if I suddenly went missing..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's eyes widened in horror.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abduction was a severe crime, and Aurora was a vital asset for the nation's future.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If anything happened to her, anyone involved in her harm wouldn't just face prison time&mdash;they'd likely be responsible for derailing Orley's progress for decades.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A glint of cold determination flashed in Aurora's eyes. "Do you understand what I need you to do?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="229.html">« Prev</a><a href="231.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
