"They all look so scary. I don't want to go. I want you, Aunt Lily. You said you'd take me to see </span><span>Mommy</span><span>. I don't want to go to the police."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears finally spilled down Lily's cheeks. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't expected Aurora's daughter to become so attached to her so quickly. It made her heart ache even more, mixed with a pang of warmth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do as I said, sweetie."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" The child cried, soaking Lily's clothes, her sobs breaking the tense atmosphere. "I want Aunt Lily. They're all bad people. They hate me, hit me, yell at me. Only Aunt Lily protects me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The child's small chest heaved, emotions running high. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's heart felt like it was being pierced as she watched her cry. She desperately wanted to raise </span><span>her</span><span>, but she knew she wouldn't have the chance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stroked the child's hair to comfort her, but the child grabbed her wrist. "Aunt Lily, don't leave me, I'm scared." The child looked up, her face streaked with tears, eyes full of helplessness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily opened her mouth but couldn't say a word. In this situation, she couldn't make any promises.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, someone shouted, "Lily!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily stiffened, looking towards the voice, locking eyes with Ethan. Her eyes widened, never expecting Ethan to find her here.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's gaze was urgent and worried. "Lily, stop killing. Turn yourself in."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily smiled bitterly. "Ethan, I deserve to die. My only regret is leaving Aurora's daughter behind." She stroked the child's head, eyes filled with tenderness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan was shocked. "Aurora's daughter?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at the child clinging to Lily's legs. "You mean her?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily nodded. "Yes, she is Aurora's daughter. When they took Aurora's kidney, they also injected her with ovulation drugs. Those monsters planned to harvest this child's kidney once their own organs failed. Aurora was such a kind person, yet her entire life was destroyed by scum. She died never even knowing she had a child."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tears welled up again, her voice thick with emotion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officer said firmly, "The law will bring those criminals to justice. That doesn't justify murder. If you release the hostage and turn yourself in now, you might get a lighter sentence."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily scoffed, "It's easy for you to say. It didn't happen to you. You have no idea what this pain feels like. I don't care about a lighter sentence. The only thing I care about is making sure the people who hurt Aurora and her daughter pay with their lives."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be stubborn," the officer warned, his tone growing harsher.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily ignored them and turned to the child. "Sweetie, do you see that man in the black suit? Go to him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I don't want to." The child clung tightly to Lily's leg, crying even harder, her little body trembling.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's heart ached. But she had to get the child away. She didn't want the child to get hurt if things turned violent. She put on a stern face and said, "Are you going to disobey me? If you don't listen, I won't like you anymore."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt Lily..." The child cried, looking at her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Lily had made up her mind, her face cold. The child, frightened by Lily's expression, slowly let go of her hand and reluctantly walked toward Ethan.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily looked at Ethan, her gaze pleading. "Ethan, for the sake of our past, please take care of her."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan replied, "Lily, don't worry, I will. Please turn yourself in. There might still be a chance."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily smiled bitterly. "Some things, once done, can never be undone."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a deep breath, her slightly disheveled hair fluttering in the wind. Her gaze was filled with determination, as if she didn't care about her own life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she raised the knife in her hand, the blade flashing in the sunlight. Time seemed to freeze, and everyone held their breath.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Lily was about to slit the man's throat, a police officer fired. A deafening bang shattered the silence, and a bullet pierced Lily's forehead. Blood spurted, staining her face crimson.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" Ethan's anguished scream ripped through the air. His eyes widened in horror, his body frozen as he stared at Lily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The world seemed to stop. A deathly silence enveloped the scene.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily felt a searing pain in her head. The world before her eyes was shrouded in red, images blurred and distorted. She began to sway, her consciousness fading. But a strong will kept her from falling immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her last ounce of strength, she plunged the knife into the man's neck. As the blade sank into his flesh, warm blood gushed out, splattering onto her face and body, mixing with her own blood.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Perfect. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man who hurt Aurora's daughter was dead, and his beloved son was now an orphan. This was real justice. With this, she could die without regrets.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily fell back slowly, like a kite with a broken string. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once blue sky in her fading vision turned blood red, then slowly faded to pitch black. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sounds around her gradually disappeared, and as her consciousness slipped away completely, she seemed to hear the intertwined voices calling "Lily" and "Aunt Lily."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[After a thorough investigation, local police cracked a major serial murder case.]  </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Detectives worked tirelessly, gathering strong evidence and identifying Lily Walker as the suspect.
