She looked as content as a cat basking in the sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, lunch is ready!" Ethan called gently from the kitchen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to see him walking out, carefully balancing dishes in his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he set the food on the dining table, he met her gaze with a tender look. "Come on, let's eat," he said softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the past month, Lily had been staying at Ethan's place and hadn't gone back to school. Ethan went out of his way every day to whip up delicious meals for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under his attentive care, Lily's body&mdash;once dangerously weakened by overwhelming grief&mdash;gradually began to recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As her health improved, Ethan finally started to relax.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the past weeks, he'd been constantly on edge, worried that Lily might do something drastic again. After all, if she took another extreme step, it would completely undermine the profound sacrifice Aurora had made.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, Lily was remarkably well-behaved, which allowed Ethan to chill out a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily sat at the dining table, quietly eating her meal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan watched her, a soft smile spreading across his face, his eyes filled with pure adoration. He carefully picked up his fork and began to serve her some food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ethan," Lily suddenly spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hand paused mid-motion. "What is it?" he asked, meeting her gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for taking care of me these past days," she said. "I'm feeling better now, and I should go back to school."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan frowned. "Lily, how about I help you apply for a leave of absence?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shook her head firmly. "No need. I want to graduate as soon as possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..." Ethan started to protest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're freaking about me going after Isabella and Frank, right?" Lily cut to the chase. "Don't worry. I promised Aurora I wouldn't go near them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan gave her the side-eye. "For real?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yep." Lily nodded firmly. Then, she added, "Look, you can drive me to and from school every day if you're that paranoid."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chewed on that for a sec. "Fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that Lily cared about Aurora more than anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's dying wish was for Lily to live well; he was certain Lily would honor it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, Lily dropped her eyes, masking the killer glint in them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd played it smart this past month. Building her strength back up while putting her hacking skills to work, hunting Isabella and Frank like a digital bloodhound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After four weeks of digging, she'd finally nailed down where those pieces of shit were hiding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">They'd had their month of freedom. Time to make them pay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The following day was bright and sunny. Ethan dropped Lily at the school gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He watched until she vanished into the crowd before pulling away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the moment his car was gone, Lily slipped right back out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As night fell and city lights twinkled, Ethan drove back to </span><span>pick</span><span> her up</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waited for a full thirty minutes, but Lily never appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled out his phone to call Lily, but </span><span>just</span><span> couldn't get through no matter how many times he tried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold knot twisted in Ethan's gut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Lily stood in some sketchy apartment building across town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hallway reeked of mold and despair, flickering lights casting weird shadows on peeling walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her knuckles rapped the door in a steady rhythm that echoed down the empty corridor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, Isabella and Frank's casual chat died mid-sentence. They shared a nervous look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's there?" Frank called </span><span>out,</span><span> voice tight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily pitched her voice low, disguising it. "Delivery."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They both exhaled, tension bleeding away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, it's just our food. That was quick," Isabella said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank pushed to his feet. "I'll get it," he said, reaching for the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He yanked it open to find a small figure in delivery gear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dim hallway and the </span><span>face </span><span>mask made it hard to make out </span><span>the</span><span> features, but from the build, it was clearly a woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank let down </span><span>his guard</span><span> </span><span>completely. "Just hand me the food."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily looked </span><span>up,</span><span> eyes cold as death. "Got you, trash."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could blink&mdash;THUNK&mdash;her blade went deep in his gut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank's eyes bugged out. "You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong?" Lily ripped off her mask, face twisted with pure hate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, she looked like a demon that had crawled straight out of hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She yanked the knife out and went to town, stabbing him over and over...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You liked torturing Aurora, huh? How's it </span><span>feel</span><span> now, asshole?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she booted Frank into the room and slammed the door, throwing the lock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella came running out to check the noise. One look and she started screaming her head off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily stood there, gripping a bloodstained knife, her clothes splattered with crimson. Frank lay motionless in a pool of blood, his fate uncertain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrified, Isabella turned to flee, but Lily was faster. </span><span>S</span><span>he lunged forward, grabbed Isabella's hair, and yanked her to the ground with brutal force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two animals! You killed Aurora. </span><span>Today's your turn to die</span><span>!</span><span>" </span><span>Lily's voice was ice cold, pure hate. Her knuckles went white on the blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella scrambled on the floor, her hair a tangled mess, tears streaming down her face. "Please... please let us go! We were wrong!" she sobbed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wrong?" Lily crouched down, pressing the knife against Isabella's neck. "Too late," she whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In one fluid motion, she brought the blade down, slicing through Isabella's tendons like butter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella's scream split the air, her body jerking like a live wire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pure terror flooded those eyes as reality hit&mdash;she wasn't walking away from this one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's gaze shifted between Frank's crumpled form and Isabella's pathetic begging. But the rage in her gut just kept burning hotter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Relax. I'm not </span><span>gonna</span><span> kill you right away. That'd be too damn easy. First, I want you to really feel what it's like being sliced up piece by piece."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said it like she was talking about the weather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank started coming to. When he clocked Lily standing there, pure terror hit his face like a truck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... what are you </span><span>gonna</span><span> do?" Frank's voice cracked with desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's eyes were dead cold, lips curling into this sick smile. "You are too vicious," she purred. "Let's crack open that chest and see if your heart's as black as your soul."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh God, no!" Frank lost it, blubbering like a baby. "Please don't! I'll do anything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella joined in, her tears streaming down her face. "</span><span>We fucked up bad</span><span>," she wailed. "</span><span>We get it now! Please, don't do this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Lily wasn't having that shit. Her eyes were blazing with straight-up murder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lifted that blade, metal catching the light like something out of a nightmare. Then - zero hesitation - carved his gut open like a pumpkin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"FUCK&mdash;" Frank screamed his lungs out, watching his insides become outsides.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="194.html">« Prev</a><a href="196.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
