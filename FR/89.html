Camille! What's wrong with you? Somebody! </span><span>Help</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camille would never have imagined that this brief moment of unconsciousness would lead to her waking up in a foreign country days later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph had gone out of his way to hire three nurses working around the clock to care for her, along with twenty bodyguards to ensure her safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She assumed she'd return home once she recovered, but when the time came, she realized that she couldn't even leave the estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The very people meant to protect her had become her jailers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Aurora arrived at Hawke Estate, every day was filled with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For someone who had spent so much of her life deprived of love, being surrounded by Beatrice, Ashley, and Daisy felt like stepping into a warm embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice's favorite pastime quickly became shopping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, she wasn't buying for herself. Her mission was to shower Aurora with gifts, determined to dress her up beautifully and make her shine like a star.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, you're young and beautiful," Beatrice declared proudly. "It'd be such a shame not to dress you up properly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Aurora rarely left the house, Beatrice indulged </span><span>her </span><span>endlessly, buying clothes, shoes, jewelry, and bags for Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Ashley and Daisy took turns cooking elaborate meals designed to tempt Aurora's appetite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their efforts paid off. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within days, color returned to her pale cheeks. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though still slender, she no longer carried the shadow of despair. Happiness bloomed in her eyes, softening the sharp edges of her sorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Aurora remained reclusive. Outside of mealtimes, she stayed holed up in her room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This worried Beatrice deeply. Several times, she tried to coax Aurora out, only to be stopped by Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandma," he said gently, "next month is your birthday. Ms. Elvador is preparing a special gift for you. </span><span>Please let her be</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mention of a handmade present lit up Beatrice's face. Thus, she nodded and decided not to disturb Aurora further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the morning, Julian sat at breakfast as his phone buzzed. It was Ethan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Picking up the call, Julian stepped toward the floor-to-ceiling window overlooking the garden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Hello."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan replied, "Mr. Hawke, Hubery has been dealt with as instructed. He's currently hospitalized and still unconscious. What are your next orders?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's jaw tightened slightly at the thought of Hubery, a lawyer who had sent an innocent person to prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he can't do his job right, then he shouldn't do it at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan wasn't surprised because he knew full well that Julian wouldn't let Hubery off easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery, a man who had sworn to uphold justice as a lawyer, betrayed his own conscience and sent Aurora, an innocent person, straight to prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the only reason Hubery was able to glide through college and eventually become a lawyer was because of Aurora. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the most grueling years of high school, when her days were packed with classes and endless pressure, she juggled part-time jobs while still finding time to enter competitions and win prize money. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every penny she earned went toward supporting Hubery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he repaid her by betraying her and sending her to prison for five agonizing years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to Aurora's sacrifices, Hubery became a lawyer. How dare he live comfortably while she suffered?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crossing someone favored by both Julian and Beatrice was a death sentence, and revenge would come swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With precision, Ethan set his plan into motion. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leveraging connections within the industry, he gathered evidence of Hubery's unethical practices and submitted them to the bar association. Within weeks, Hubery's license was revoked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>***</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the anesthesia wore off, the excruciating pain from his broken leg jolted Hubery awake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lying in the hospital bed, he groaned in agony, wishing he could slam his head against the wall just to escape the torment. But the physical pain was nothing compared to what awaited him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>News of his disbarment and the accompanying multimillion-dollar fine hit him like a freight train.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he had only been practicing law for five years, his growing reputation was enough to secure him a comfortable life in Orley, the bustling metropolis that never slept. He had managed to buy himself a sleek apartment and a shiny new car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his finances were stretched thin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was unable to pay the fines, so his house and car were seized, and the money in his bank account had dwindled to almost nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he finally left the hospital, his bank account held a mere 10 thousand dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He searched desperately for a new job, but his broken leg hobbled him at every turn. The weight of his lost qualification pressed down on him as he struggled to stay afloat in a sea of rejection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperate for work, he reached out to former colleagues and friends. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the same people who once greeted him warmly now avoided him like the plague. Calls went unanswered, and pleas for help met with icy indifference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One lonely night, Hubery sat alone in his dingy rented apartment, surrounded by dampness and decay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staring at the empty walls, he felt despair claw at his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Hubery struggled, Elvador Group and Sherwood Group faced their own crises. Business partners abandoned them, terminating contracts without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua and Adolph scrambled to salvage their companies, but no matter how hard they worked, the stock prices continued to plummet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Hawke Estate, Aurora poured her heart into crafting the perfect gift for Beatrice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was seated at her desk as sunlight streamed through the window, casting a golden glow over her figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before her lay an almost-finished piece of embroidery, a breathtaking depiction of roses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her fingers danced gracefully across the fabric.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze was unwavering and resolute, fixed intently upon the embroidery. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each stitch, her needle descended with precision and delicacy, the thread and fabric intertwining in perfect harmony, not a single flaw to be found.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her stitching techniques were diverse and ever-changing. The petals shimmered with lifelike vibrancy, crafted using layers of silk thread ranging from delicate pink to deep crimson. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With meticulous care, she used intricate techniques to create texture and depth, bringing the flowers to life. At the center, golden stamens stood out vividly, exuding an aura of elegance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unbeknownst to her, Julian stood silently behind her, watching in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Never had he imagined her skill with embroidery could rival that of The Garden, a renowned masterpiece. To the untrained eye, one might mistake her work for the original.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the days passed, the countdown to Beatrice's birthday began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this month, Joshua's exhaustion showed in his bloodshot eyes. He scoured financial reports late into the night, searching for solutions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those once-loyal partners, who had sworn their unwavering support with solemn vows and fervent promises, now turned their backs, announcing contract terminations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He unleashed his frustration upon his subordinates. Yet, a sinking realization that his outburst would do little to change the dire circumstances they faced dawned on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other side, Adolph attended endless business events, hoping to rebuild connections, yet he always returned defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His once-immaculate appearance deteriorated. His hair remained unkempt, and his shirt collar was perpetually open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amidst the chaos, their last hope rested on Beatrice's upcoming birthday celebration, an event rumored to attract elite families from Orley and Putnam. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The birthday gala was to be held in the most opulent hotel in all of Orley. If they failed, all would be lost.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="88.html">« Prev</a><a href="90.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
