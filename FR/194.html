"As long as you're alive, I'll do anything you want." Her voice shook with desperate pleading. "Aurora, hang in there. The doctors will definitely save you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's breath felt like razor-sharp blades slicing through her lungs, each gasp an unbearable torment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A coppery sweetness rose in her throat, but she fought to suppress it, not wanting to worry anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, don't cry..." she whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's tears blurred her vision so entirely that Aurora's face became indistinguishable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly wiped at her eyes, desperate to catch just a few more glimpses of Aurora. Still, her tears flowed like a broken dam&mdash;uncontrollable and relentless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her frail, skeletal hand trembling, Aurora reached out to wipe away Lily's tears. "Don't be sad," she murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Aurora tried to comfort them, the more painful it became for everyone in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily huddled on the edge of the </span><span>bed,</span><span> her body wracked with uncontrollable sobs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her shoulders heaved violently, her breathing ragged and shallow, teetering on the brink of collapse from overwhelming grief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people around her were equally devastated, their eyes red and tears streaming down their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora watched, feeling completely helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been so sure that drinking the pesticide would end things instantly. She picked this method because she knew the odds of survival were practically zero.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With steely resolve, she had downed the entire bottle, only for fate to play a cruel joke by letting her be rescued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, she was stuck witnessing the raw pain of those around her&mdash;exactly what she'd wanted to avoid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guilt and anguish swallowed her whole. She tried to speak, to offer some comfort, but as soon as she opened her mouth, thick, dark blood gushed out uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It spewed from her lips and nose, splattering onto the pristine white sheets&mdash;stark crimson against the pale fabric, horrifying to behold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood wasn't just coming from her mouth and nose. It began seeping from her eyes and ears as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked like a tortured spirit risen from hell&mdash;her face covered in blood, her body a grotesque testament to her suffering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora!" Lily screamed a heart-wrenching cry that seemed to tear through the very fabric of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overwhelmed by the horrific sight of Aurora's bleeding, Lily reached the breaking point of her grief. The massive wave of despair and terror became too much. Her body went limp, and she collapsed, falling unconscious beside the dying Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian trembled violently, his eyes filled with pain and despair. "Doctor&mdash;doctor&mdash;" he cried, his voice cracking with madness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's consciousness began to fade. She saw Lily collapse in overwhelming grief, Julian's face pale and twisted with anguish, and the shocked expressions of those around her, looking completely lost. Moments later, she passed out cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hospital room erupted into chaos. Medical staff rushed in at the desperate calls, quickly wheeling Aurora into the operating room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hours crawled by, with the surgery room light burning steadily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian sat motionless in his </span><span>wheelchair,</span><span> his body completely numb. His tears had long since dried up, and he remained frozen like a statue, not even blinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After an eternity, the surgery room light went dark. The doctor emerged, his face etched with exhaustion and a profound sense of defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Julian saw </span><span>it</span><span>, his heart sank, an ominous feeling washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is Aurora?" Julian's voice trembled, his eyes locked onto the doctor's face, desperately searching for a miracle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the doctor delivered the news he dreaded most. The words hit like a devastating blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We did everything we could," the doctor said softly. "I'm sorry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" Julian shook his head frantically, refusing to accept the harsh reality. "It's impossible! Aurora can't be gone. Go back&mdash;save her, please!" His desperate pleas echoed through the sterile hospital corridor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel, Ethan, Darren, and Samuel stood </span><span>frozen,</span><span> shock written all over their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>T</span><span>otally unacceptable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Aurora</span><span style="font-style: italic;">'</span><span style="font-style: italic;">s</span><span style="font-style: italic;">... </span><span style="font-style: italic;">dead?

Why?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Fate was </span><span style="font-style: italic;">too</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> cruel</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> to her</span><span style="font-style: italic;">!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was nothing short of an angel&mdash;hardworking, smart, with a heart of pure gold. She'd never done a single thing wrong in her life. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the moment she was born, she'd been abandoned by her father and spent fifteen lonely years in an orphanage. When she finally came home, all she got was mistreatment, false accusations, and five brutal years behind bars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she got out, she was constantly targeted, betrayed, and pushed to the brink until her tragic death. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasn't there supposed to be justice for good people? How could someone as virtuous as Aurora meet such a tragic end?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The question burned in everyone's mind, a searing, unanswerable pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of them could accept it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian went mad with grief, grabbing the doctor and screaming hoarsely, "Aurora can't be dead! She promised to marry me. I haven't even brought her home yet. Do something&mdash;bring her back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel closed his eyes, unable to bear the scene. "Sir," he said softly, "Ms. </span><span>Elvador</span><span> is gone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words struck Julian like a physical blow. He vomited a mouthful of blood, collapsing from the overwhelming anguish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily&mdash;who had just regained consciousness&mdash;walked into the room at that precise moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her footsteps halted abruptly as she heard Daniel's words. Her gaze locked onto the operating room door, unblinking and frozen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what felt like an eternity, she slowly approached, each step weighed down by impending tragedy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan reached out to her, softly calling, "Lily..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Lily couldn't hear a thing. She brushed past Ethan and walked straight into the operating room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora lay motionless on the cold surgical table, the lights above as pale and lifeless as winter snow. Her hospital gown was stained with blood, her complexion even whiter than the stark sheets. Dark traces of blood lingered at the corners of her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily stared at </span><span>Aurora,</span><span> her eyes filled with unbearable grief. The once vibrant eyes were now sunken and vacant, having long since run out of tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood frozen, as if every ounce of strength had drained away at the sight of Aurora's broken form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With fingers ice-cold, </span><span>she</span><span> gently caressed Aurora's face&mdash;a tender touch filled with heartache. "Aurora, you've finally left me," she whispered, her voice like a torn and ragged bellow, rough and broken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My heart's shattered. I want nothing more than to die with you, but I can't just give up like this." Her voice trembled with raw emotion. "Aurora, I'm sorry. The promise I made to you&mdash;I might have to break it. I can't&mdash;I won't&mdash;let those who hurt you walk free."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The suffering Aurora had endured&mdash;the betrayals, the pain, the relentless despair&mdash;how could Lily possibly let her tormentors escape justice? She could never accept that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, Isabella and Frank have to pay. I'll take them all out and then join you in the afterlife. How does that sound? Take your time on the road to the underworld. Wait for me. If there's another life, I'll find you first. I'll protect you and never let anyone hurt you again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice grew fainter, dissolving into a near-whisper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Everything you've done for me... in the end, I'm bound to let you down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Aurora, please don't blame me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's gaze toward Aurora was impossibly gentle, yet she let out a bloodthirsty smile.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="193.html">« Prev</a><a href="195.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
