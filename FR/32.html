"Alright, I'll go right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett finished speaking and walked away without looking back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy, carrying the thermos, was about to leave when Celeste called out, "Daisy, I'll go with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she gently removed Bertha's hand from her waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha's heart jolted. Barnett's threat had clearly been aimed at her. If she had known Barnett was watching </span><span>upstairs</span><span>, she would never have tried to take the salmon chowder. It wasn't worth the risk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha's frustration simmered beneath the surface, but she still put on a pitiful expression. "Mom, I want to go to the hospital with you to see Aurora."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste hesitated, but she stood firm. "Aurora has a misunderstanding about you. It's better if you stay home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Celeste and Daisy left together, leaving Bertha and Joshua behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha couldn't keep up the act any longer. She stamped her foot in anger and complained, "Ever since Aurora came back, Barnett has stopped hating her. He actually scolded me for her sake. Dad, you have to help me teach Aurora a lesson. If she takes Mom and Barnett's hearts away, she'll rise above me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was shrill and grating. At that moment, she resembled a plucked peacock&mdash;frustrated, ugly, and far from her usual docile self.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua sat on the sofa with his arms crossed, his face dark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a sly smile crept onto his face as he reassured her, "Don't worry. That girl won't cause any trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha's eyes lit up. "Dad, have you thought of a way to deal with her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua let out a cold laugh. "In a few days, the Hawke family will be coming from Putnam to Orley to bid on the east district project. If the Hawke family is determined to get that land, even if we join forces with the Sherwood family, we might not stand a chance. If we want a share of that project, the best way is through a marriage alliance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha frowned, "Dad, you're not thinking of marrying Aurora into the Hawke family, are you? Marrying into Putnam's top family is not a punishment for her. It's a reward. I disagree."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua laughed. "My dear, how could I let that girl rise above you? It's said that the Hawke family's heir has a physical disability, which makes him violent and ruthless. He enjoys 'taming' women to satisfy his twisted desires..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha's excitement grew. She thought, "That's perfect! Aurora is already so weak. A few nights with Mr. Hawke might kill her. It would save me the trouble of getting my hands dirty."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha leaned closer to Joshua, her eyes gleaming with malice. "Dad, when do you plan to make your move? Don't let Barnett catch on. He's completely protecting Aurora now. If he finds out, he'll definitely make a scene."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua snorted coldly, "I'll handle it. Just act like you don't know anything. Don't slip up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha nodded eagerly. "I understand. I can't wait to see Aurora being tortured by Mr. Hawke."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora sat in the hospital, staring blankly out the window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Celeste and Daisy entered the ward together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora turned her head, looking at Celeste coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste sat down by the bed and looked at Aurora's thin, pale face. She spoke with concern, "Aurora, you must be hungry. I brought..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not my mom," Aurora flatly denied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste was taken aback, feeling a pang in her heart, but she forced herself to stay calm. "Whether you admit it or not, I'll always be your mother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! I've already paid you back! So, you're not my mom," Aurora repeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears instantly welled up in Celeste's eyes. "Aurora, do you really hate me that much? What more do you want from me to accept me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would never accept her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste choked out, her tone almost pleading, "Aurora, eat something first, okay? You can yell at me all you want after you've eaten."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora spoke indifferently, "Mrs. Elvador, I'm not angry with you. I've paid you back. From now on, we're strangers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tone was distant, devoid of any affection a daughter might have for her mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's heart ached again. She forced a smile. "Alright, I know you're not angry. Eat first. We can talk about other things later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leave." Aurora's tone brooked no argument.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora..." Celeste tried one last time, but Aurora's next words shattered all her courage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora said softly, "Seeing you makes me lose my appetite."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste was thunderstruck. Her body jolted, and her face turned pale. As tears threatened to spill from her eyes, she quickly turned and fled the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She leaned against the cold wall outside, covering her mouth to stifle her sobs, but muffled cries still escaped from her throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long while, Celeste finally composed herself and looked through the glass window into the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She saw Daisy sitting by Aurora's bedside, feeding her with a spoon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was actually smiling at Daisy, her lifeless eyes now sparkling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste couldn't hear their conversation, but she could see them chatting and laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked like a real mother and daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sight deeply wounded Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt an urge to rush in and push Daisy away to take her place, but she didn't dare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through their interactions, she had finally realized that Aurora didn't care about her and didn't want her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste couldn't accept this outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was her own daughter. How could severing their relationship be so easy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She waited outside for a long time before Daisy finally came out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy was surprised to see Celeste there. She had thought Celeste had left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Elvador, shall we go back now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste glanced at Daisy with displeasure. "You go ahead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was about to enter the ward again when Daisy hesitated, "Mrs. Elvador, maybe we should leave. Ms. Elvador is tired."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste frowned, "Do I need your permission to see my own daughter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, that's not what I mean."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then you can leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy wanted to persuade her further, but facing Celeste's warning look, she could only sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste snorted and pushed the door open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Aurora didn't ask her to leave. It was time to have a clear conversation with Celeste, for Daisy's and Lily's sake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Celeste was about to sit by the bed, Aurora pointed to the chair across the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sit there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's steps faltered. Aurora's resistance hurt her, but she sat down anyway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked into her eyes and spoke first, "I know what you want to say. If you're seeking my forgiveness, I can agree, but I have one condition. If you can do this one thing, I'll forgive you."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="31.html">« Prev</a><a href="33.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
