No one had any evidence to point to Julian's actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had heard about his ruthless methods before, but the rumors were nothing compared to the terror of witnessing it in person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the deepest corners of their minds, each person silently vowed never to cross this man again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian slowly lifted his head. His icy gaze swept across the ballroom, sharp as a blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, everyone lowered their heads, not daring to meet his eyes. They were afraid that locking eyes with him would invite some unseen disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, they understood one thing. Julian, the man standing at the pinnacle of the Hawke family, was not someone to be trifled with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face remained cold and detached as he raised his hand slightly, his voice calm but carrying an undeniable authority. "Take them away. Send them back to Putnam."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several bodyguards immediately stepped forward, dragging Judy and Anderson out of the ballroom like sacks of potatoes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy's limp body left a glaring trail of blood on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson, his eyes blank, offered no resistance as he was led away. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their figures slowly faded from view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ballroom fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes turned toward Bertha and Adolph, still kneeling on the ground, held in place by the bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Bertha's punishment seemed the lightest, merely a shaving of her hair, her heart was swept by a tempest of fear, each surge threatening to engulf her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart pounded violently, as though it would burst from her chest. Every breath she took trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't stop thinking about how Julian had mercilessly made her bald, just for pulling on Aurora's hair earlier today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but recall the far worse and more malicious things she had done to Aurora in the past. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of what Julian might do if he found out was enough to freeze her blood. She could hardly imagine the terrifying, cruel punishment awaiting her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more she thought about it, the more her body shook. Her teeth chattered in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What terrified her the most, though, was the realization that Beatrice, the guest of honor at today's banquet, was the very same woman who had helped Aurora in Camille's hospital room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That revelation felt like a knife stabbing into her already panicked heart, dragging her into a bottomless pit of despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She dared not look up at Julian's expression, afraid to read her own tragic fate in those cold eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Images of cruel punishments flashed through her mind: chopped-off fingers, stripped of clothes, broken limbs, lost teeth...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each one made her shiver in fear. In her mind, she frantically prayed that she would never have to face such horrors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph's face was just as pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since his father handed him the family business, he had been fighting alone in the competitive world of commerce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always prided himself on his ruthless tactics, believing himself to be a master manipulator. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Orley's business circles, he was a well-known figure, commanding attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, standing next to Julian, he realized how inexperienced he truly was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian was a madman, a calculating, meticulous madman who could punish others while keeping his own hands clean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph&rsquo;</span><span>s shirt, soaked with sweat, clung tightly to his body, outlining his disheveled </span><span>figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian walked slowly toward them, each step of his leather shoes echoing through the room. The sound of his footsteps was sharp, like the striking of a hammer, making everyone tense with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stopped in front of Bertha and Adolph, looking down at them with an expression as cold as ice as if they were mere ants beneath his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ballroom was so silent that every person's heartbeat was audible. Everyone held their breath, waiting for Julian's verdict.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cruel smile twisted at Julian's lips. He pulled out his phone and dialed the police with deliberate, graceful movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was low, yet clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello</span><span>.</span><span> I'd like to report a robbery. Bertha, the heiress of Elvador Group, stole a piece of my embroidery worth 20 million dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, the room erupted into whispers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robbery was a serious crime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the law, a robbery could lead to a prison sentence of at least three years and up to ten years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And with the value of the embroidery piece being a staggering 20 million dollars, the sentence would likely be even harsher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd exchanged nervous glances, their eyes turning toward Bertha with shock and sympathy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha's face drained of color at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Images of Aurora's suffering in prison flooded her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she really ended up in prison, with the power of the Hawke family behind Julian and his vengeful nature, it would be easy for them to end her life behind bars</span><span> without others knowing</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! Please, no!" Bertha cried out, struggling wildly, but the bodyguards easily overpowered her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She screamed in desperation, her eyes wide with fear, "Mr. Hawke, I didn't mean it! I can pay you back. Call my parents! They'll send the money right away! Please, don't send me to prison."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears poured uncontrollably down her pale face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian ignored her pleading, turning instead to look at Aurora. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression softened, as though he had turned into a different person, one far removed from the cold, ruthless man he had just been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this what you wanted?" he asked, his voice gentle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stood there, frozen, her gaze locked on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she realized what Julian was doing. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was using Bertha's own methods to give her the justice she had been denied. This was Julian's way of avenging her, by making Bertha face the consequences of her actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the pain of those five years spent unjustly imprisoned slowly faded in the warmth of Julian's protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's eyes filled with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were so many things she wanted to say, but her throat tightened and her words stuck in her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, all she could manage was a soft, tearful "Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph glared at Aurora, his eyes wide with shock, as if accusing her of being heartless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as though he couldn't understand why she would allow such things to happen to Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to speak, but with socks stuffed in his mouth, only muffled sounds came out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a fit of panic, he started to struggle </span><span>with all his strength</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And so, the</span><span> </span><span>bodyguards had difficulty keeping him under control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan, observing this, frowned in irritation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't going to stand by and let Adolph cause a scene. Without hesitation, he raised his foot and delivered a powerful kick to Adolph's stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The kick sent Adolph gasping in pain, his body curling into a painful arc. Sweat poured from his forehead as he convulsed in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's expression remained icy as he extended his foot, using the tip of his shoe to tilt Adolph's chin up, forcing him to look him in the eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's voice was as cold as steel. "You</span><span> and</span><span> Bertha</span><span> are in this together</span><span>. You won't escape prison either."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph was extremely horrified. Fear was evident in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stood quietly, watching it all unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Adolph's terrified expression, her disdain for him deepened even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Adolph knew it. He knew what it was like to be sent to prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>W</span><span>hen she was </span><span>set up and</span><span> </span><span>imprisoned, suffering for five long years, Adolph had known the truth. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet he had chosen to ignore it. He had refused to listen to his sister's words, preferring to deceive himself and believe Bertha's lies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since he </span><span>ha</span><span>d</span><span> </span><span>sided with Bertha so </span><span>against all odds</span><span>, </span><span>it</span><span> wa</span><span>s </span><span>only fair that he too </span><span>experience</span><span>d</span><span> </span><span>the consequences of his actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the police arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian exchanged a few words with the lead officer and pointed toward Bertha and Adolph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officers immediately stepped forward, </span><span>handcuff</span><span>ing</span><span> </span><span>them both.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! I don't want to go to prison! Please, no!" Bertha screamed, her legs kicking out in desperation, but it was </span><span>useless</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officers hauled her away, her cries echoing through the ballroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's mind flashed back to five years ago, when she too had been dragged out of a similar grand banquet hall by the police.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been shouting then. "It wasn't me, it was Bertha who pushed..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could finish her words, Celeste had slapped her across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You wicked </span><span>brat</span><span>! </span><span>You&rsquo;re the culprit and try to frame Bertha?!</span><span> Your father and I saw everything! You did it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, Bertha had stood behind Celeste, her eyes full of mockery, as if to say, </span><span>"What does it matter if you're the real heiress? You'll still have to take the fall for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Bertha had been so smug, so full of herself. Now, she was a broken woman, bald, tear-streaked, and looking nothing like the arrogant girl she once was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five years ago, Bertha had been the star of the banquet, the pampered princess of the Elvador family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five years later, the tables had turned, and now Bertha was the one being carted off by the police.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph was being dragged away as well, the socks in his mouth were now removed by the officers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he passed Aurora, he shot her a disappointed look. "Aurora, look at what you've become. You've really let me down. Don't think I'll forgive you easily."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="104.html">« Prev</a><a href="106.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
