Mr. Sherwood promised that if we took 'good' care of you, he'd find a way to get us a reduced sentence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never said who Mr. Sherwood was, but she knew, without a doubt, that it had to be Adolph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only he had the power to reach into the prison like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those three years in high school competitions had led her to believe that Adolph was a refined, well-mannered heir to a wealthy family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after entering prison, she realized that the gentleness she once saw was just a facade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The true Adolph was ruthless, vengeful, and cold-hearted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like waking from a deep dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora instinctively stumbled backward, as if trying to escape a monster. The fear in her eyes was palpable, and her pupils seemed to tremble with terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This frantic retreat seemed to trigger something in Adolph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression darkened with displeasure as he watched her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's mind spun in panic, her body dizzy from the fear, and with every step back, she almost lost her balance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Adolph quickly moved toward her, grabbing her waist and pulling her into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hand, which had been resting on her waist, tightened instinctively as he felt the delicate curve of her body. His brow furrowed in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was so thin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's heart raced from the sudden embrace, her body stiff and unresponsive, as if invisible ropes held her in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cold, commanding presence of Adolph was suffocating. It was as if he had the power to control everything around her, and she could barely breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking down at her, Adolph saw the terror in her once-clear eyes. Her long lashes trembled, like a frightened deer caught in a trap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave a small smirk, though something unreadable flashed in his gaze. "What are you running from?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice, deep and magnetic, only seemed to grow more jarring in the tense silence between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora struggled to free herself from his grasp, but his arm was like iron, locking her in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised her head to look at him, and found his face dangerously close, too close. She could feel the heat of his breath against her skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frantically, she lowered her gaze and pushed against his broad chest, desperate to break free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"L-let me go," she managed, her voice trembling despite her efforts to stay calm. The slight shake in her voice betrayed the fear gnawing at her insides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her, Adolph was a sword hanging over her neck, always ready to strike. The only way to feel safe was to get away from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph noticed the panic in her eyes, and for a brief moment, he felt a twinge of sympathy. But it vanished quickly, replaced by his usual icy detachment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you so afraid of?" he muttered, almost to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was he who should be suffering&mdash;the one who had watched his own sister get hurt, the one who had been betrayed by the person he had cared for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But somehow, Aurora always looked like the victim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What bothered him most was that he actually felt bad for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he feel this way when Camille was lying unconscious in a hospital bed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph's jaw tightened. Without another word, he shoved Aurora away, sending her stumbling backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nearly lost her balance, but her shoulder collided with the wall, preventing her from falling flat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she avoided falling, the pain in her still-healing shoulder shot through her like a knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora gritted her teeth, forcing herself to remain silent, but the veins on her forehead pulsed, betraying her agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face drained of color, sweat beading on her brow, dampening the strands of hair that clung to her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph's eyes softened for a brief second, and he moved as though to reach out and steady her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he stopped himself, his hand hovering in mid-air, torn between wanting to help and the anger simmering inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The anguish in his chest deepened. Seeing Aurora in such pain stirred something deep within him, something he'd buried long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora steadied herself and, after a moment of hesitation, turned away. She took one hesitant step, and then another, moving slowly but steadily toward the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph didn't follow her. He didn't call her name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's heart, which had been thundering in her chest, slowly began to quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time in what felt like an eternity, she felt a shred of peace. She didn't dare look back, feeling like she had just narrowly escaped death. She picked up her pace, focusing only on getting out of the hospital and back to her room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as she limped forward, Adolph's voice cut through the air, soft and almost tender, calling her name, "Aurora."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound was barely a whisper, like a breeze brushing past her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora didn't hear him. Since the incident with Celeste, her hearing had grown worse, and now her remaining ear would sometimes go completely deaf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph, seeing she didn't stop, assumed she was deliberately avoiding him, but there were things he needed to say. His voice grew louder, firmer. "Julian's not someone you want to mess with. You should stay away from him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian was ruthless in business, and without a steel grip, he would never have been able to control the massive empire of the Hawke family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Hawkes weren't just rich&mdash;they were a powerful, high-ranking family, built on unyielding tradition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora would never find happiness there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph thought for sure she would turn around at this warning, but she didn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora didn't hear a word. The ringing in her ears drowned out everything else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't care less about stepping outside now. She just wanted to retreat to her room and forget the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph stood frozen, watching her recede, feeling an aching distance between them. It was like there was an insurmountable chasm between them now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the urge in him, raw and powerful, refused to let her slip away entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A voice in his mind screamed, "Go to her! Don't let her go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of her slipping from his life forever was unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as his feet began to move, his phone rang, pulling him back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hesitated, then pulled it out. It was Camille's attending doctor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suppressing the whirl of emotions in his chest, he answered, "Hello."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Sherwood, please come to the hospital right away. Your sister is showing signs of waking up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A rush of joy surged through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart skipped as he cast one last lingering look at Aurora, a glint of longing in his gaze before concern for his sister took over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned, hurriedly heading toward Camille's room. His footsteps echoed urgently in the hall, every stride marked by the impatience thrumming through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph burst into the room, breathless. "How is she? What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor, calm and methodical, explained, "We've noticed slight movements in her fingers, and we're picking up brain activity. This means she's conscious. Just unable to move or respond fully."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph's heart raced. "So... she can hear us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, theoretically."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camille's mind was awake, but her body remained completely paralyzed, unable to move or respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph sat by her bed, gently taking her hand in his. "Camille, can you hear me?" he whispered, his voice soft, filled with a mix of hope and desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He watched, wide-eyed, as her eyes flickered, just a brief movement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was enough to send a thrill of excitement through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaned closer, brushing her cheek with his fingers, his voice thick with emotion. "Camille, you've finally reacted. You have no idea how much I've missed you. I've been so worried these past five years."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His joy was soon replaced by something darker, colder. He leaned down, his voice a whisper of fury. "Tell me... was it Aurora who did this to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five years ago, he had already gotten an answer, but over the years, he had desperately clung to the hope that it had been some mistake, that Camille had suffered some other accident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he watched a tear slip down Camille's face, that hope shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Was it really Aurora?" Adolph's voice turned icy, his hand tightening around hers, his knuckles whitening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camille's tears flowed more freely, her body trembling with the effort to communicate. She wanted to speak, but she couldn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trapped in her own body, she knew what had happened to her, but could do nothing to stop it.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="56.html">« Prev</a><a href="58.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
