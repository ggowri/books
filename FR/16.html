"What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The maid shrank her neck and mumbled with her head down, "Mr. Elvador, we've always prepared meals for four people in the house, so..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her explanation seemed weak. Instead of calming Barnett down, it was like adding fuel to the fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett questioned, "So what? Were you blind and didn't see my sister had come back? Or did you see her but deliberately not prepare a portion for her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Elvador, I..." The maid wanted to explain but was impatiently interrupted by Barnett. "You're fired."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The maid looked terrified and turned to Bertha for help, only to see Bertha keep her head down, lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua coughed, saying, "Daisy, go make another portion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay." Daisy became happy and quickly went into the kitchen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha's eyes rolled, and she immediately put on a concerned expression, pushing her breakfast in front of Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora didn't look at her and didn't say anything, but she didn't reject Bertha's "kindness". She was hungry, so she picked up the fork and started eating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She ate unhurriedly as if all the embarrassment and disputes around her had nothing to do with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha looked at her expectantly, as if waiting for her to say something. But after waiting for a long time, Aurora didn't even glance at her. Bertha's emotions gradually turned into disappointment, and she put on a sad look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua tapped the table to remind Aurora, but Aurora continued to eat her breakfast without even looking up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahem." He coughed loudly once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Aurora remained unmoved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste couldn't stand it anymore and said with a slightly disappointed tone, "Aurora, look how concerned Bertha is about you. Why don't you thank her now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora thought, "So that's what they want. I can't even have a peaceful breakfast. What is it? A compliance test?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had obeyed them for three years, but it didn't earn their genuine affection. If I am to obediently follow them again, I will be a fool."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora put down the fork, swept a glance at them, and said, "Thank her for what? Thank her for taking over my life? Thank her for sowing discord and framing me? Or thank her for the five-year prison term she brought me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just because I ate a meal of hers, you want me to thank her. But during the three years I was in this house, I couldn't even have breakfast or lunch. When I came back at night, not only did I have to eat your leftovers, but I was also verbally humiliated. Shouldn't your whole family apologize to me first?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't do what they expected her to do. It was so hypocritical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's eyes showed even more disappointment. "Those are all in the past. Why can't you just let it go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora retorted, "The harm was done to me. You tell me it's in the past? Why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste covered her heart, looking heartbroken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's anger finally got out of control and exploded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted, "Because I'm your father, you have to obey me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, I'm telling you, don't think you can do whatever you want just because you're back home. This family won't be any different with or without you. If you resent us, you can leave right away. I've never said this family welcomes you back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora suddenly sneered, her laughter full of sarcasm, "Did I want to come back to this home? What happened last night, Mr. Joshua Elvador, have you forgotten it so soon?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to use me to resume cooperation with the Sherwood Group, but you act like I'm the one who's pestering you to stay in this house. Are you so high and mighty? Am I just supposed to be degraded by you to nothing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up." Joshua was so angry that his whole body was shaking. He suddenly stood up from his seat and walked quickly in front of Aurora. Then, without hesitation, he slapped her across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The slap was extremely forceful. Aurora was slapped onto the dining table, and the plate in front of her fell to the ground and shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face swelled up instantly. The corner of her mouth split, and blood slowly oozed out, dripping onto the white tablecloth, looking particularly glaring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her already-poor-hearing right ear became completely deaf under this huge impact. Her brain was buzzing as if countless bees were flying around her ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did this slap hurt?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Aurora, it didn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she had already been used to being beaten in prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But not feeling pain didn't mean she didn't hate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora turned her head with a cold expression. Joshua's face was full of anger, with no trace of affection in his eyes. Celeste looked heart-stricken but didn't make any real attempt to stop it. Barnett's brows were tightly knitted, and a complex look appeared in his eyes but quickly turned cold again. Bertha couldn't hide the schadenfreude in her eyes in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The grievances that had been pent up in Aurora's heart for years finally erupted like a volcano at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora suddenly exerted all her strength with both hands and violently flipped the dining table in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a loud bang, tableware and food scattered all over the floor, creating a mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua and Celeste were startled by her sudden action and took a few steps back. Bertha was so frightened that she let out a scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, you're insane," roared Barnett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you treating me like this?" Aurora shouted hoarsely, "What exactly did I do wrong to be treated like this by you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled up in her eyes and mixed with the blood from the corner of her mouth, sliding down her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste took a step forward, trying to hold Aurora, but was forcefully pushed away. "Aurora, calm down. We're all family. What can't we talk about properly? Why does it have to come to this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua glared at Aurora, pointing at her and scolding, "You unfilial daughter. How dare you make a scene here? Look at what you've become. You're a disgrace to the Elvador family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha hid behind Joshua and said softly, "Aurora, don't be like this. It's all my fault. Don't be angry, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora couldn't hear what they were saying at all. She could only see their mouths opening and closing, with expressions of anger, disappointment, or grievance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was like a trapped beast, roaring desperately. She roared hard, but she couldn't even hear her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stumbled towards the door, but the scene in front of her became blurred. She felt dizzy as if the world were spinning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tried her last bit of strength to stand still, but her body swayed uncontrollably. Her knees buckled, and she fell forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora." Barnett rushed forward. At the moment Aurora was about to hit the ground, he held her tightly in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His arms were slightly trembling as he held Aurora with great care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She was fine just now. What's wrong with her now?" Celeste was so anxious that tears streamed down her face, completely at a loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua snorted, "I know her well. She has no other skills but being good at pretending."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's enough." The veins on Barnett's forehead bulged. "Aurora has fainted, and you're still making sarcastic remarks. I'm starting to doubt if Aurora is your biological daughter." With that, he picked up Aurora and strode towards the upstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua was furious, saying, "If she weren't my daughter, she wouldn't even have the chance to throw a tantrum in front of me."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="15.html">« Prev</a><a href="17.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
