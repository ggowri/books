Right after hanging up the phone, she promptly dialed Joshua's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment the call got through, Bertha blurted out anxiously, "Dad, hurry to the hospital. Mom sold her bags, and she's on her way there now to give Aurora the money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bertha, take it easy. I'll rush over to stop her," Joshua replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a triumphant </span><span>smile</span><span>, Bertha resumed picking out bags and jewelry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the hospital, when Celeste saw Aurora again this time, she was more confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was pretty sensible. Noticing Celeste's cheerful demeanor, she knew Celeste had readied the 10 million dollars she'd been longing for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could hardly wait, yet still feigned calmness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste seated herself right by the hospital bed and affectionately grasped Aurora's hand. After asking solicitously about Aurora's physical condition, she took out a bank card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, I assured you that whatever request you made, I'd spare no effort to fulfill. There's 10 million dollars in this bank card. Once you take it, let's bury the hatchet. Please don't hold grudges about the past anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was pleasantly taken aback but maintained her outward composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those 10 million dollars in hand, she'd no longer have to cower before the threats from the Elvador family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Aurora was about to reach for the bank card from Celeste, the ward door was forcefully kicked open from outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Aurora and Celeste were jolted by the sudden deafening noise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua stormed in. Without a moment's hesitation, he delivered a stinging slap to Aurora's hand. Then, he snatched the bank card from Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste was bewildered. "Joshua, what are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why didn't you discuss it with me before giving her the money?" Joshua glowered, his eyes blazing with fury as he regarded Aurora as if she were his sworn enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste rolled her eyes at him. "Well, it's not an exorbitant amount, just 10 million dollars. We've owed Aurora over the years, so it's only right that we give her some compensation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ten million dollars? Does she deserve that much money?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She screwed everything up, and she only embarrassed our family. But if Aurora was as sensible as Bertha, we could give her 10 million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But she's incorrigible. She even nearly stabbed me with a knife. I'll be damned if I waste my hard-earned cash on an ingrate like her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After spitting out these angry words, Joshua stuffed the bank card into his pocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's hand was swollen, and she stubbornly endured the pain without saying a word, just staring intently at Joshua.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua met her stare defiantly and sneered, "You want money? Fine. As long as you're willing to get married to solidify the Elvador Group's position as a powerful force in Orley, I can give you 10 million dollars as your wedding gift. If you're not willing, you won't even get a cent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Joshua took Celeste outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste seemed confused, but she couldn't argue with Joshua.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment they stepped out of the ward, Celeste yanked her hand free from Joshua's grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why were you being so mean to Aurora? If we just hand her the 10 million dollars, she'll forgive us and forget everything. We can still be one big happy family. Why do you have to go against her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not going against her. She's never truly regarded us as family." Joshua's tone was unyielding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since she dared to stab her father once, she might do it again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you willing to live with a ticking time bomb like her? One day, she could explode and wipe us all out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rather than keeping this loose cannon around, it's far better to marry her off pronto. She might even grease the wheels for cooperation between the Elvador Group and the Hawke family in Putnam."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..." Celeste started to object, only to have Joshua cut her off. "The Hawke family is vying with us for the project in the eastern suburbs, but we don't stand a chance on our own. If we arrange a marriage between Aurora and them, it'll be a win-win. That's the optimal solution. If you won't let her do her part, we'll have to send Bertha. Are you prepared to see Bertha marry into Putnam?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste immediately shook her head without thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Bertha wasn't their biological daughter, she was as dear to them as if she were. Celeste had poured her heart and soul into raising Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste certainly didn't want her daughter to marry out of state. If Bertha was bullied, there would be no one to stand up for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just the thought of Bertha being wronged was too much for Celeste to bear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked deeply at Aurora, who was pale in her hospital bed, and pressed her lips. She eventually just sighed without saying anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the ward, Aurora had overheard every word. She was seething with rage, her whole-body trembling. Her hands clenched into tight fists, her fingernails digging deep into her palms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Never in her wildest dreams had Aurora expected Joshua to be so callous, willing to barter her away like a common commodity to further his business interests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste had been pleading with her for forgiveness just a couple of days ago, yet when it came to Bertha's interests, she was quick to sacrifice her flesh and blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora thought to herself, "Well, haha...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They're such hypocrites. What a cruel irony!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took Aurora what seemed like an eternity to quell the fury raging within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was desperate to send Lily abroad, and for that, she needed money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, money was precisely what Aurora lacked the most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was she to do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>F</span><span>ollowing Joshua seemed like her only option.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given her situation, marriage might be her best escape from the Elvador family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had no idea what the Hawke family in Putnam was like, but surely they couldn't be worse than the Elvador family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora could break free from the Elvador family and receive 10 million dollars as a wedding gift. With that money, she could send Daisy and Lily overseas, and the Elvador family would never again hold sway over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed a perfect solution, at least on the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet having her fate dictated like this still left Aurora feeling suffocated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After getting out of bed, Aurora hobbled out of the ward, intending to get some air in the stairwell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She made her way into the stairwell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawke, I've checked that parcel of land. It's an ideal place for development into a commercial district, which would boost our economic prospects. If we get it, not only can we expand our business empire, but we'll also gain a firm foothold in Orley. Our business dealings between Putnam and Orley will run much smoother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, we're not the only ones who want this land. Several powerful families in Orley, including the Elvador family and the Sherwood family, are vying for it. The Elvador family in particular is eager to ally with you through marriage to achieve mutual benefits. What do you think..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian Hawke remained silent, merely casting a dispassionate glance at his assistant, Ethan Ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan promptly fell silent, signaling "OK" with his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawke, do you have any further ideas? If not, I'll attend to my duties."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, go ahead," Julian said, his voice low and commanding, leaving no room for argument.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan took his leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian leaned against the wall and lit a cigarette.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stairwell was so quiet that one could even hear a pin drop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had assumed the place was empty, but as she entered, she spotted a man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe Julian heard the footsteps, so he looked up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stood on the upper steps, and Julian on the lower ones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, their eyes locked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Aurora got a clear look at Julian, she was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian looked tall and strong in a black suit. His features seemed to be carefully sculpted works of art, with sharp angles, and his eyes were as deep and mysterious as the night sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just stood there silently, doing nothing, but he looked so majestic that it was hard to get close.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="34.html">« Prev</a><a href="36.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
