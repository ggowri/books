His thoughts remained unreadable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon arrival, medical staff rushed Aurora into the emergency room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The harsh fluorescent lights in the hallway cast an eerie, pale glow, reflecting Daisy's frantic, exhausted face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, a doctor arrived, his expression grave. "The patient has suffered a serious head injury and excessive blood loss, compounded by an infection from the rain. Her condition is critical. Who is the patient's family? We need someone to sign the consent form for surgery immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy hesitated, her voice trembling. "Can a maid sign it? I'm her maid."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor shook his head firmly. "It must be a family member. You need to contact them quickly&mdash;time is running out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a panic, Daisy fumbled for her phone, her fingers shaking as she dialed Joshua's number, but the call wouldn't go through. He had blocked her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Refusing to give up, she called Celeste. When the phone connected, Daisy, desperate, cried out, "Mrs. Elvador, Aurora is&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish, Celeste's voice cut through sharply. "Daisy, are you losing your mind? Aurora is my daughter. We're parenting her, not you. You've been fired. Don't ever call me again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The line went dead, each dial tone like a hammer to Daisy's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperate, Daisy tried calling Barnett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had just had his head bandaged and, seeing Daisy's name, immediately guessed she was calling about Aurora. He answered impatiently, "What is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sob in her voice, Daisy pleaded, "Mr. Elvador, Aurora's in critical condition. Can you please come to the hospital right now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words reminded Barnett of his and Bertha's injuries, which only served to ignite his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasn't he already good enough to Aurora?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was she still causing trouble for?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had become increasingly difficult&mdash;first threatening Joshua with a knife, and then smashing Bertha with an ashtray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed to discipline her, or she'd go too far.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a cold voice, Barnett replied, "Her life or death doesn't concern me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for a response, he hung up, the finality in his tone cutting off the last shred of hope Daisy had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stunned and helpless, Daisy stood in the hospital corridor, her eyes pleading with Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, please, I beg you, help save Aurora."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having served the Elvador family for over ten years, Daisy could immediately tell that Julian came from an influential family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People like him, wealthy and powerful, could solve her problems with just one word. She looked at him as if he were her last hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor, seeing the situation escalate, urged again, "The patient is in critical condition. If we don't act now, she could die. Where's the family member? Please sign the consent form!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hallway was filled with a tense atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian furrowed his brows as he glanced at the flower embroidery on his suit jacket, his mind drifting to the unfinished piece. He turned to the doctor. "I'll sign it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor sized him up. Julian's posture was regal, his air of nobility and authority evident in every gesture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the sterile hospital corridor, he stood out like a diamond, almost too dazzling for this environment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor asked, "Who is the patient to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The question took Julian off guard. He and Aurora were barely acquaintances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy, thinking quickly, said, "He's her fianc&eacute;."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Julian with eyes full of hope, silently begging him to confirm her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's gaze lingered on Daisy for a moment, but he said nothing. He took the pen and signed the consent form with fluid motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the doctor entered the operating room, Daisy turned to Julian, overwhelmed with gratitude. Her eyes were red as she choked back tears. "Sir, thank you so much! If it weren't for you, Aurora might not make it through today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian remained impassive, his long legs crossed as he sat on a bench in the corridor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surgery dragged on, the first light of dawn creeping in, but the operating room door remained closed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Julian's phone rang, breaking the tense silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened his eyes slowly, showing no signs of fatigue despite the long hours. He still exuded that aristocratic, distinguished aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With practiced ease, he retrieved the phone from his pocket, the caller ID "Grandmother" flashing on the screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandmom," Julian answered, his tone as neutral as always.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice Hawke, on the other end, was in high spirits. "You rascal! When did you find a girlfriend? Why didn't you tell me about your future wife?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Girlfriend?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian was caught off guard. He wasn't aware of any such development.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing Beatrice had been hounding him about marriage for months, he assumed she was subtly bringing it up again. "Grandmom, is there anything else?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't it okay for me to call you? Just because I'm not asking about anything else?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, well, with your sour attitude, you may scare the girl off. Tell me where you are right now&mdash;I'm coming to see you. I need to meet your future wife."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandmom, if you don't have anything else to discuss, I'm hanging up." Julian didn't want to entertain the subject now, and with that, he ended the call abruptly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Hawke Estate in Putnam, Beatrice sighed as the phone clicked off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That cold brat&mdash;don't know who he takes after. The rumors about him and women have been flying for years, and I wish he'd be a little more playful, at least show he has some interest in women. But no, he's about to turn thirty, no girlfriend, no romantic involvement. Sometimes I wonder if he's into men. I've been worrying about his marriage for so many years, and now there's finally a glimmer of hope. I need to see this for myself, or he'll scare the poor girl off with his coldness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The maid, Ashley Anson, listened to Beatrice's grumbling with a smile. "How do you know Julian found a girlfriend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice grinned and opened a chat with Ethan. "Ethan sent this to me last night. I just saw it this morning. Come. Take a look at this girl."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley leaned over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The photo showed Aurora with Julian, pressed against the hood of a Rolls Royce. The dim yellow light from the street lamps gave them a warm, almost intimate glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first glance, Beatrice was thrilled, feeling as if her great-grandson were calling out to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's side profile was captured in the photo. With a sharp nose, full forehead, and crimson lips, it was clear she was a beautiful girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ashley felt like she'd seen this face before&mdash;she just couldn't place it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's pretty, but too thin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice also scrutinized the photo. Aurora's slender arms, with bones visible, made her look fragile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She is a bit too thin, Ashley. Pack my bags. I'm going to Orley right now. I need to make sure my grandson's future wife gets some proper nourishment."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="51.html">« Prev</a><a href="53.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
