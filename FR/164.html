Lily's heart skipped a beat.</span><br><span>Though she had only met Ethan a few times, she found herself drawn to his handsome, scholarly, yet slightly rebellious appearance.</span><br><span>Her university was filled with attractive men, but none of them caught her attention the way Ethan did.</span><br><span>It was only Ethan she liked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, she wouldn't have used herself as bait to attract him when they first met at the bar.</span><br><span>But after discovering that Ethan was into men, she had no choice but to let go, even though it hurt.</span><br><span>Lily gently placed the bank card in his hand and said, "Don't worry. I won't ask anything from you. I won</span><span>'</span><span>t talk about what happened between us."</span><br><span>After a brief pause, she continued, "Please don</span><span>'</span><span>t tell my mom or Aurora about this, especially Aurora. She's not in good health, and I don't want her to worry about me."</span><br><span>Lily looked up and met Ethan's gaze.</span><br><span>His eyes sparkled like dazzling stars.</span><br><span>The longer she gazed into them, the more her resolve wavered.</span><br><span>She quickly turned her face away, stood up, and made to leave.</span><br><span>But suddenly, Ethan reached out and grabbed her wrist.</span><br><span>Lily was forced to stop and looked at him in confusion.</span><br><span>"Are you in some kind of trouble?" he asked gently. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you are, you can tell me. For Daisy</span><span>'</span><span>s and Ms. Elvador</span><span>'</span><span>s sake, I</span><span>'</span><span>ll help you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked up at her as he spoke, his Adam's apple bobbing, exuding a unique charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily tried her best to suppress the fluttering in her heart, reminding herself.</span><br><span>No matter how handsome he is, he's gay. Lily, snap out of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily scoffed and forcefully shook off Ethan's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not in any trouble. You worry about yourself. My affairs are none of your concern."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her sudden shift in attitude surprised Ethan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">She was as docile as a cat just a moment ago. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How did she turn on me so quickly?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Ethan found her feisty demeanor even more intriguing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan stood up. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tall and imposing, he almost enveloped Lily in his shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily disliked the opposing&nbsp;sense and instinctively stepped back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ethan, as if deliberately teasing her, closed the distance step by step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you backing away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't like being too close to men."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan suddenly sneered, "Really? I remember you holding onto that man's waist pretty tightly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's tone carried a hint of&nbsp;jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily looked at him in disbelief. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, she thought she saw a questioning look in Ethan's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she quickly dismissed the thought.</span><br><span>I must be mistaken. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan doesn't like me, so why would he care about me holding another man?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"None of your business."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't forget, I saved you when we first met. The second time we met, I almost slept with you. Do you want to cut ties with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pressed forward, backing Lily into a corner until her back hit the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why is Ethan suddenly acting crazy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If I didn't know he was gay, I'd almost think he's interested in me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily rarely felt at a loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But facing Ethan, she had no idea how to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she was hesitating, a rapid knocking sound came from the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The knocking was loud, accompanied by Samuel's anxious shouting. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Walker, are you in there? Did that bastard force you? Open the door!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Samuel's voice, Lily quickly pushed Ethan away and hurried to open the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel stood outside, looking tense. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw Lily, he immediately pulled her out of the room and inspected her carefully. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked anxiously, "Lily, are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine. Let's go," Lily said, pulling Samuel to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind her, Ethan's cold voice rang out. "Lily!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's heart skipped a beat. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt a pang of guilt but pretended not to hear and kept walking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, her hand was grabbed by Ethan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're an elite at Orley University of Technology. Are you really planning to get involved with someone like him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel, hearing Ethan belittle him, grew angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone like me? I'm Lily's boyfriend. Our relationship is none of your business."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan looked displeased and turned to Lily. "He's your boyfriend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily hesitated for a moment before saying, "Yes, he's my boyfriend. Now, let go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan not only didn't let go but tightened his grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered, "If he's your boyfriend, why did he force you to drink? And why did you ask me for help?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is my business. You don't need to meddle," Lily said, forcefully shaking off Ethan's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily took a deep breath as if making a decision. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't believe me? Fine, I'll prove it to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she grabbed Samuel's collar and stood on her tiptoes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their noses pressed against each other's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel was stunned by her sudden move. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood frozen, completely unresponsive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From Ethan's perspective, it looked like Lily was kissing Samuel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clenched his fists tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily stepped back and turned to Ethan. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now do you believe me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's face darkened instantly, and he glared at Lily through gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily avoided his gaze and pulled Samuel away, walking briskly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan watched their tightly clasped hands, unable to suppress the anger burning in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He punched the door hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, you're </span><span>really </span><span>something."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel rode his motorcycle, lips pressed tightly together, his expression grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it seemed like Lily had kissed him, their lips hadn't actually touched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized Lily had used him as a tool to provoke that man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Samuel thought about it, the angrier he became, feeling like a heavy stone was lodged in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without asking Lily if she wanted to go back to school, he parked the motorcycle directly in front of a bar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After getting off, he grabbed Lily and dragged her into the bar without a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the bar, the lights were dim, and the music was deafening. Men and women were dancing wildly to the beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel pushed Lily onto a couch in the corner and leaned over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily reacted quickly, lifting her leg to press against Samuel's chest, stopping him from going further. Her cold eyes glared at him. "Looking for a fight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face, illuminated by the flickering lights, exuded a dangerous aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel's courage, which had just surged, vanished the moment he met her hostile gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sighed in frustration and slumped onto the couch beside her, his head resting on her shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Walker, I really like you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily teased, "Any use of your affection?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you fall for me too, I'll treat you well forever," Samuel said eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"Forever" is the biggest lie men tell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Hubery once promised Aurora that he would always protect her, that he would send everyone who hurt her to prison once he became a lawyer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">His words were vivid, but the man himself had changed beyond recognition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Believing men's promises leads to a miserable end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily stood up.
