Why did you have someone break my parents' legs? And why did you send my sister to prison? What do you want from us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian narrowed his eyes, examining the disheveled man before recognizing him as Barnett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's once-pristine suit hung wrinkled on his frame. His hair fell messily across his forehead, and stubble covered his face, giving him a haggard appearance. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dark circles beneath his bloodshot eyes were so pronounced they resembled bruises.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was startled at the sudden commotion. She stirred in Julian's arms, her long eyelashes fluttering as she slowly opened her eyes, still hazy with sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she registered the tense scene and realized Julian was holding her tightly, a blush crept across her cheeks. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawke," she said with embarrassment, "please put me down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's arms suddenly felt empty. He frowned slightly with displeasure, throwing a colder look at Barnett, who had awakened Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Barnett saw Aurora, surprise flashed in his eyes before quickly giving way to anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recalled drowning his sorrows in alcohol daily after Aurora's disappearance, drinking until he developed a perforated stomach that landed him in the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After his discharge, he'd wandered like a walking dead. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whenever he thought of Aurora's award certificates and Vertar University admission letters stashed in the utility room, he hated himself for destroying her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the past month, Barnett had tortured himself to the point of self-destruction, attempting to atone for his sins through self-punishment. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet he never imagined Aurora would have </span><span>hooked up</span><span> with Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to a month ago, Aurora looked remarkably better. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face had filled out with a healthy glow. She wore haute couture and had been held intimately in Julian's arms. The sight stung Barnett deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized that while she'd been missing, she must have been living comfortably. Meanwhile, he'd been a fool, kept in the dark, worrying about her needlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora!" Barnett shouted, his voice hoarse with rage. "</span><span>Mom and </span><span>Dad's legs were broken by Julian, and they're hospitalized. How could you stay with him? </span><span>Don&rsquo;t you care about</span><span> your family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What family? I don&rsquo;t think I have one,&rdquo; Aurora replied, her eyes were as calm as ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her soft voice landed like a bombshell, carrying a power that pierced hearts, echoing in the silent night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett faltered, guilt flickering across his face. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened his mouth but found his throat constricted. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long moment, he managed to say, "Aurora, </span><span>blood is thicker than water</span><span>. If you have any problem with us, come home. We can resolve them together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora remained unfazed, her tone icy. "All I get when I return to the Elvador family is beatings. When have you ever felt sorry for me? When have you ever tried to solve problems peacefully?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes revealed profound disgust as if she were looking at something repulsive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She went on, "You're always talking about morality and justice, judging me from your high horse without looking at your own faults." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You lied to me, not just once or twice, but for three whole years. I kept trusting you, giving you endless chances, and what did I get? I ended up in prison. I paid with broken legs and lost a kidney. That should be more than enough to repay your parents for bringing me into this world."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The painful memories no longer stirred any feelings within her, as if the pain had </span><span>completely frozen her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett knew Aurora spoke the truth, but she was his parents' biological daughter, and he didn't think she could be so heartless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pointed accusingly at Julian</span><span> and asked Aurora</span><span>. "</span><span>Seriously? Do you have to be so cruel?</span><span> </span><span>You still wanna be with him even he&rsquo;s the reason why your parents got hurt that badly</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian was extraordinary&mdash;</span><span>he was basically the very perfect man that every woman dreamed of.</span><span> But Aurora knew she was scarred and unworthy of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett interpreted her silence as confirmation. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lost control, shouting, "You're an adult! How can you </span><span>not tell</span><span> right from wrong? Our parents' legs were broken. Do you know how painful it is to have both legs broken?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora suddenly laughed&mdash;a laugh so bitter and ironic it cut through Barnett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes widened as his gaze fell on Aurora's injured leg. Instantly, the fight drained from him. He deflated, looking even more haggard and miserable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one understood the pain of broken legs better than Aurora, who had experienced it firsthand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I believe your parents' injuries have nothing to do with Mr. Hawke," Aurora stated firmly, looking toward Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's eyes softened with a smile, his manner indulgent toward her. "It has nothing to do with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan quickly added, "I can testify that Mr. Hawke hasn't seen Mr. Joshua Elvador or Mrs. Celeste Elvador today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Julian and Ethan claimed was indeed true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had no reason to doubt this&mdash;she had seen Celeste and Joshua earlier when she arrived at the hotel. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, both </span><span>of them </span><span>had been perfectly fine. Only Daniel knew what happened afterward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Daniel, as did Julian and Ethan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel, as Julian's employee, remained perfectly composed under their gaze. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Joshua Elvador and Mrs. Celeste Elvador fell down the stairs and broke their legs," he stated calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora, Julian, and Ethan remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bullshit!" Barnett yelled at Daniel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hotel entrance had fewer than 10 steps. Even if they had genuinely fallen, they would have sustained minor scrapes at most. How could both people break their legs simultaneously?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can ask the security guard at the door</span><span> if you don&rsquo;t believe it</span><span>," Daniel replied evenly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The security guards had been watching. When </span><span>he</span><span> was mentioned, his heart began to race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hurried over, smiling nervously. "Mr. Elvador, your parents did fall down the stairs accidentally and broke their legs. We all witnessed it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other security guards at the hotel entrance chimed in unison, "Yes, we all saw it happen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's eyes widened in disbelief. He knew it was impossible, yet everyone corroborated the story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's lips curved into a knowing smile. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett must be familiar with this feeling. After all, five years ago, Joshua, Celeste, Barnett, Bertha, Hubery, and Adolph had treated her precisely this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Barnett caught Aurora's half-smile, he felt so much pain that he could barely breathe. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agony spread through his body as he suffocated under the weight of knowing the truth but lacking evidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked up sharply, searching for surveillance cameras. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's cold voice reached his ears. "My people always clean up</span><span> the traces</span><span> thoroughly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The meaning was clear&mdash;even if surveillance footage existed, it would have been deleted, just as Celeste had deleted footage proving Aurora's innocence five years ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fighting fire with fire had always been Julian's favorite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the fountain lights about 30 feet away illuminated, startling the fish and shattering the reflection of stars and moon on the water's surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the flickering light and shadow, Julian casually fiddled with his pinky ring and said to Daniel, "Well done. You'll get a doubled year-end bonus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally relieved, Daniel replied with a smile, "Thank you, Mr. Hawke."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a pause, he turned to Aurora. "Thank you, Ms. Elvador."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This blatant provocation nearly made Barnett faint with rage. "You... You..."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="106.html">« Prev</a><a href="108.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
