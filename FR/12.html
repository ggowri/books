Her body trembled, and she stepped back continuously, her face pale. "Aurora, please don't look at me with such resentful eyes. I'm scared."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua pushed Aurora away angrily and roared, "What do you want to do to Bertha?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora lost her balance and staggered backward. Her body hit the railing, almost falling off the second floor. But no one cared about her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua and Celeste both protected Bertha, looking at Aurora warily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett wanted to scold Aurora. But thinking about the bullying she endured in prison, he couldn't say those hurtful words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's expression was cold, but her faint smile revealed her sarcasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Well... they're my family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If Bertha even hints she's upset, everyone will blame me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Back when I cared, just a look or word from them could mess with my mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Now? I don't care. Their misunderstandings don't bother me at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora didn't explain and lowered her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her appearance of not caring about whatever others said made Barnett's heart hurt. He couldn't help but ask with concern, "Did you get hurt? Does it hurt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked up at him in surprise, finding it hard to connect him with the one who had used to humiliate her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Habit was really a terrifying thing. Aurora was actually not used to Barnett's slightest bit of concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It doesn't hurt," said Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The pain from a bump is not even one-ten-thousandth of the pain of a broken leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just now... did you hear everything?" asked Barnett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was stunned for a moment. When she realized what he meant, she softly replied, "Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, there was no more conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett thought, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">"Is that all?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I </span><span style="font-style: italic;">end the deal</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> with the Sherwood Group to avenge her, causing both the Sherwood Group and the Elvador Group to lose one billion dollars overnight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">With such a huge price paid, can't I even get a word of gratitude from her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of pent-up anger spread from Barnett's chest straight to his stomach, as if he had swallowed a hundred needles. His stomach churned violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His stomach problem flared up again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if to punish Aurora, Barnett stared at her with a pale face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, every time he had a stomachache, Aurora had been the most anxious one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett looked at her with hopeful eyes, hoping to see anxiety and concern on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if it was just a simple word of concern from her, everything he had done today would be worth it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was no expression on Aurora's face. Her gaze didn't even linger on him for an extra second, let alone show any pity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If there's nothing else, I'll go back first," said Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked calm, but the words she said were so heartless, like a blunt knife, cutting Barnett's heart to pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the gaze of four pairs of eyes, Aurora turned around and walked slowly but firmly down the stairs, limping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett leaned on the railing with both hands, looking at her back with a pained and disappointed expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It shouldn't be like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">She used to care so much about me. When I had a stomachache, she would cry and look for medicine for me, wishing she could take my pain instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why doesn't she care about me now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora," shouted Barnett sternly, enduring the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora instinctively stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hope rose in Barnett's eyes at this scene, and his voice unconsciously softened, tinged with a hint of grievance. "Aurora, my stomach hurts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like giving Aurora a chance to reconcile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the fact that he offered a chance didn't mean she had to take it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked up, gazing at Barnett from below, and sneered, "Mr. Elvador, if you have a stomachache, you should call a doctor, not me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett heard the sound of his heart breaking. All his expectations seemed ridiculous under her calm expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain instantly overwhelmed his whole body, and his legs could no longer support him. He slid down and fell onto the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his hands tightly grasped the railing, and he stared at Aurora through the gaps between the railings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora, however, turned around directly, showing no intention of taking care of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heartlessness made Joshua furious. He roared at Aurora's back, "Aurora, come back and get medicine for Barnett."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste pleaded with her in tears, "Aurora, you used to take care of Barnett every time he had a stomachache. How can you be so indifferent this time? You're blood-related. Why has it come to this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Bertha started to condemn her righteously. "Aurora, I know you're resentful because you've been in prison for five years, but you can't joke about Barnett's life. Don't you know which medicine works best for him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stopped again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Elvador family thought she was persuaded. However, when Aurora turned her head, they found that she was smiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was a hidden edge in her smile. "So you did notice my efforts, but you just didn't care or cherish them. Since that's the case, I'll take them back. From now on, whether you, the Elvador family, are well or ill, alive or dead, it has nothing to do with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, you don't care about me, and I'm over you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those words hit Joshua, Celeste, and Barnett hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste cried even more, looking at Aurora with tear-filled eyes. "Aurora, that's not true. You're the daughter I longed for. How could I not care?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's expression turned dark. "How did we end up with such an ungrateful daughter? We wouldn't have brought you back if we knew you'd be so unruly and jealous, always targeting Bertha. Then our home wouldn't be a mess."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste, still crying, tugged at Joshua. "Don't talk about our daughter like that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua snorted and gave Aurora a fierce glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha tried to calm things down, "Dad, it's natural Aurora resents me. I took the heiress spot and the family's love that should've been hers. If it makes her happy, I'll endure anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she started to sob, "Aurora, I can leave. Just don't upset Mom and Dad or abandon Barnett, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora watched their act quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they were done, she said, "Finished? I'm going back to sleep."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her indifference made Joshua furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pointed at Aurora, disappointment in his eyes. "You said you have no feelings for this family. So why come back? You're a convict, a stain on the Elvador name. Who let you return?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leave if you want. We were happy without you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You act like we owe you something, but remember, we brought you into this world and owe you nothing."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="11.html">« Prev</a><a href="13.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
