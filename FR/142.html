Anyone who crossed him would pay a heavy price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as his smile widened, a car sped over and stopped abruptly behind his vehicle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door swung open, and a woman with a bandage over one eye charged out like a rabid beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her remaining eye gleamed with a menacing glint, locking onto Joshua like a predator eyeing its prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Joshua!" the woman screamed, rushing up to him and, without warning, slapped him hard across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You killed my father, got Barnett thrown in jail, and took Aurora away from me. And now you've sold the property I gave you to save that bastard child of a mistress, Bertha? I'll kill you today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman was Celeste, dressed in a hospital gown. Her face was deathly pale, and blood seeped from her missing eye, staining the bandage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face twisted in </span><span>rage,</span><span> she looked like a vengeful ghost risen from hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clawed at Joshua, her nails leaving bloody streaks across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua, confined to his wheelchair, had no way to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted in pain, "Frank, get this madwoman off me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank immediately stepped forward to restrain Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha was his birth daughter, and he couldn't let Celeste ruin their plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before Frank could lay a hand, a strong grip seized his wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked up to see Darren, a top doctor from </span><span>Orley</span><span> Central Hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing here?" Frank asked, startled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren was here because Celeste had discovered Joshua leaving the hospital and, in a panic, had begged Darren to drive her after him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had followed Joshua's car all the way to the Hawke Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren glared at Frank with disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just yesterday, he witnessed Frank and Isabella engaging in an intimate act in a hospital parking lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight had left him stunned and repulsed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste and Joshua's marital feud had been the talk of the hospital, with Celeste exposing Joshua and Isabella's affair, Bertha's true parentage, and the fact that Frank was actually Isabella's brother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Darren didn't know Frank's true identity and assumed he was Isabella's brother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Witnessing such immoral behavior between siblings had left him deeply disturbed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren, a man of strong principles, detested such unethical acts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he punched Frank square, his nose bleeding profusely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he kicked Frank hard in the groin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank let out an agonized scream, doubling over in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua, furious, pushed Celeste away and shouted at Darren, "Have you lost your mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring the bloody scratches, he turned to Frank, asking with concern, "Frank, are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Joshua's mind, Isabella and Frank were devoted siblings, orphaned at a young age and relying on each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank had dropped out of school early to support Isabella through college.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Isabella found out he had failed to protect Frank, she would be heartbroken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Bertha greatly respected her uncle, often saying, "A mother's brother is like a father." Joshua agreed wholeheartedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank had dedicated his life for Bertha, remaining unmarried and childless even in his forties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Joshua's eyes, there was no better man in all of </span><span>Peloland</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua glared at Darren, snarling, "If Frank can't have children, I'll make you pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren couldn't help but laugh, looking at Joshua as if he were an utter fool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're worried about him?

I knew your Jerome family was nothing but trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been buried in work, and you still went ahead and seduced Frank, drugged him, and raped him while he was unconscious!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How fucking shameless are you? You&rsquo;re a woman, not being at home to care for your family, you&rsquo;re out there fucking around. You make me sick!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These outrageous accusations shattered Darren's sense of decency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste trembled with rage, her chest heaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She regretted ever falling for Joshua, a man so cruel, manipulative, and shameless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had betrayed their marriage, heartlessly abandoned Aurora in an orphanage, and brazenly brought home a child born of his affair, forcing her to raise the girl for over 20 years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, he had the audacity to turn the tables on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Joshua, I'll kill you!" she screamed, lunging at him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the gates of the Hawke Estate slowly opened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy stepped out, her face cold as she said indifferently, "Weren't you here to see Mr. Hawke?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene outside fell silent. Joshua's face lit up with hope, and he swatted away Celeste's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when he saw that it was Daisy who had opened the door, his brows furrowed in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why is this old hag here?" he muttered disdainfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy didn't respond, simply staring at him with an inscrutable look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua bristled at the challenge to his authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How dare a lowly servant look at him like that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then he remembered they were at the Hawke Estate, and Daisy must be working there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since he had to show some respect to Julian, he decided to let it slide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold snort, Joshua said, "Frank, let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, Frank's pain had eased a little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he pushed Joshua past Darren, he shot him a menacing glare, as if warning, "Dare spread lies again, I'll kill you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren, unfazed, turned to Celeste and said, "Celeste, let's go in too."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And so, the four entered the Hawke Estate's living room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua had rehearsed his words carefully before arriving, but the moment he stepped and saw the people gathered there, his mind went completely blank.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="141.html">« Prev</a><a href="143.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
