Without another glance, she turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she stepped out of the alley, her movements halted abruptly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone was standing at the entrance. The man's figure was backlit, his face obscured by darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's stomach dropped.</span><br><span>He must have seen everything I just did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If he saw it, then I can't let him go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, she instinctively raised the knife in her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man noticed her movement and suddenly spoke, "It's me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily froze. Slowly, she lowered the knife. "Ethan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah." Ethan nodded, his expression difficult to decipher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily remained silent for a long moment, her voice turning slightly hoarse. "You saw everything?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah." Ethan didn't look away, simply standing there, his gaze deep and unreadable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, silence fell between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chilly breeze drifted through the alley, brushing against Lily's face. The thick scent of blood clung to her nose, heavy and inescapable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Ethan broke the silence. "Lily, what you just did is a crime."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She scoffed, "What? Are you going to call the cops on me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan met her eyes and sighed, "No."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then move." She shoved him, but he grabbed her wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His grip was too strong for her to break free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come with me," Ethan said, leaving no room for argument.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily struggled against his hold. "Why should I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at her, unwavering. "Do you really want to walk back to school covered in blood?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily stiffened. She lowered her gaze, finally registering the deep red stains soaking her clothes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the dim glow of the streetlight, the blood stood out even more glaringly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily stopped struggling and let Ethan pull her into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car sped through the city streets, neon lights flashing across the windows, casting shifting colors over Lily's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan brought her back to his place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pushed open the door and stepped aside, motioning for her to enter before following in and shutting the door behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go clean yourself up first," he said, his voice calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily said nothing and walked straight into the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the sound of running water filled the quiet space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan settled into a chair by the window, pouring himself a glass of red wine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deep crimson liquid swirled as he gently tilted the glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took slow sips, his gaze fixed on the city view outside, though his mind wasn't on the view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was unclear how much time had passed before the sound of running water gradually came to a stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily stepped out of the bathroom, draped in a white bathrobe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her damp hair clung to her face, droplets of water slipping from the tips of her strands. The soft glow of the lights illuminated her skin, making it appear almost luminous, her beauty carrying a quiet elegance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's gaze darkened slightly as his eyes lingered on her longer than they should have.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily, however, seemed indifferent. She walked straight over and snatched the wine glass from his hand, tilting her head back and downing it in one go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, without hesitation, she grabbed the bottle and drank straight from it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire bottle was emptied in moments. Her cheeks quickly flushed a deep red, and her eyes grew hazy with intoxication.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She set the bottle down on the table, looking at Ethan and asking, "Got more?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No," Ethan answered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily didn't believe him. "You're lying."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan remained silent while she turned and strode toward the kitchen, pulling out a bottle of liquor from the cabinet. Twisting the cap off, she lifted it to her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing?" Ethan quickly stepped in front of her, blocking her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm so fed up. Just let me drink."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan said with concern, "Drinking like this will only hurt your body."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurting my body? What about my heart? It hurts a lot. How do I fix that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice trembled, and her eyes turned red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know who I just beat? She was the one who made Aurora deaf in prison, the one who broke her leg. Aurora's life is ruined, and yet that piece of trash got released early? She gets a second chance at life. Why does she deserve that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Lily spoke, the more agitated she became, her emotions spiraling out of control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She even took a million dollars from Adolph's parents, claiming she wanted to start over. Isn't that hilarious? Don't you think it's ridiculous?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She dared to hurt Aurora, so I made sure she got the same treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I did more than that. She's not just deaf and crippled anymore. Now she's blind, mute, and missing all four limbs. Even if she survives, she'll be nothing but a useless shell. A complete and utter wreck."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily burst into laughter, loud and unrestrained. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as the laughter grew, tears streamed down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised the bottle again, taking a sharp gulp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The liquor burned down her throat, deepening the flush on her cheeks. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body swayed, her balance slipping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan stepped forward and caught her, holding her steady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She leaned against his chest, mumbling incoherently, "But no matter what I do, Aurora will never be the same again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why is the world so unfair? Aurora is such a good person. Why did she have to suffer so much?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have no idea what she went through in the Elvador Villa for three years. She was in high school then. Her coursework was so demanding. But she still had to please those bastards, work part-time to pay for Hubery's tuition, and tutor me. Even with all that, she still ranked first in her grade every year and won scholarships."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan had already investigated Aurora's past. He knew how hard it had been for her. But hearing Lily sob as she recounted it made his heart ache in a way he hadn't expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop crying. Everything will be okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily shook her head, her tears falling endlessly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it won't. Aurora is disabled now. She'll never be okay again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's why I have to make everyone who hurt her pay, ten times, a hundred times over. Aurora is too kind. She can't bring herself to do what needs to be done, so I'll do it for her. If the law won't punish them, then I will. I'll make sure they suffer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's brows furrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily was treading a dangerous path, one that led straight to prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, you're drunk. Stop drinking." He grabbed the bottle from her hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give it back," she snapped, anger flaring in her eyes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't need you to tell me what to do!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan suppressed his impatience and coaxed her gently, "Stop this. Go get some sleep."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Lily was too far gone in her drunken haze. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't listen to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She grabbed the front of his shirt, her breath warm with the scent of alcohol. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who do you think you are? I don't even know your full name. What gives you the right to boss me around?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan looked at her, his expression serious, and spoke clearly, "My name is Ethan Ward. Make sure you remember it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ethan Worm?" Lily murmured, her drunken eyes unfocused as she slurred the words, a hint of confusion in her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you called Worm? Worms are disgusting. I don't like them."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="166.html">« Prev</a><a href="168.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
