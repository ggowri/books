But just as quickly, her composed, indifferent expression returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Samuel could react, Ethan had already closed the distance. His </span><span>fist</span><span> swung straight toward Samuel's eye socket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a dull thud, the punch landed squarely. The impact sent Samuel staggering, his body jerking to the side as the skin around his eye rapidly swelled into a deep purple bruise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel stumbled back a few steps, nearly losing his balance and collapsing onto the pavement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barely managing to steady himself, he clutched his aching face, fury and disbelief contorting his expression as he roared, "Who the hell are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan didn't respond. His lips pressed, his gaze carrying an unmistakable coldness. He delivered another brutal punch, this time driving it straight into Samuel's abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel was also completely enraged. He was a young master from </span><span>Orley's</span><span> elite families, someone used to have the world bow at his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Apart from being humiliated by Lily, that fearless woman, when had he ever been treated like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, some stranger had appeared out of nowhere and started beating him for no reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clenching his teeth, Samuel raised his arm to block Ethan's punch, then swiftly lifted his leg, aiming a sharp kick toward Ethan's knee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily, having regained her composure, casually took a step back, leaning against Ethan's car. With her arms crossed, she watched the fight unfold with an amused expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan </span><span>were</span><span> terrifyingly fast. Before Samuel's foot could come close, Ethan had already grabbed his ankle. With a powerful yank, he sent Samuel flying through the air, flipping him onto the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel crashed down hard, his back slamming against the pavement. A groan of pain escaped him as cold sweat beaded on his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan towered over him, his voice calm but laced with a dangerous edge. "Don't want your family to go bankrupt, stay away from Lily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A gust of night wind tousled the loose strands of hair on Lily's forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Ethan, observing how his Adam's apple bobbed slightly as he breathed and how the veins on his neck stood out from exertion. The raw strength in his stance made him look undeniably attractive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her fingers absentmindedly twirled a strand of her hair as her gaze swept over his frame. She was secretly admiring him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His posture was upright, with broad shoulders and long legs. Paired with those thin gold-rimmed glasses, he had the appearance of a refined gentleman. But when he fought, he was shockingly ruthless, exuding a dangerous charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she didn't already know he was gay, she might have been tempted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily sighed internally. This was exactly her type. Too bad she had no interest in gay men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she was lost in thought, Ethan suddenly turned around, his gaze locking onto hers. Their eyes met. The first thing he saw was the look of detached scrutiny in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, Lily was just a simple, innocent college girl who always found herself being harassed by men. Every time he encountered her, she had been in a vulnerable situation, delicate, fragile, in need of protection.</span><br><span>Why is she looking at me like that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I must be imagining things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan blinked and focused, but by then, Lily had already masked her momentary slip. She changed her expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body tensed, hands unconsciously gripping the hem of her shirt. Her lips were pressed tightly together, and her eyes were filled with fear, making her look utterly fragile and helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan let out a breath of relief.</span><br><span>See? I must have imagined it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without giving her a chance to react, he strode forward, grabbed her, and shoved her into the car. Sliding into the driver's seat, he started the engine, and with a sharp screech, the tires spun against the asphalt before the car sped off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Samuel lay sprawled on the ground, watching the car disappear with a look of pure grievance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Walker! I'm on your side! I just got my ass kicked, and you stood by and did nothing? Worse, you left with the guy who hit me! You're too cruel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car sped down the road. Ethan gripped the steering wheel tightly, while Lily sat quietly inside. For a moment, neither of them spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere was thick with tension. Frowning, Ethan took a deep breath and said in an exasperated tone, "Why are you out alone at night again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You&rsquo;re really unlucky, huh? First that bar, then those thugs&hellip; good thing I was around both times.</span><span> </span><span>Now this&hellip; If I hadn&rsquo;t been around tonight, things could&rsquo;ve gone bad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more he spoke, the more unsettled he felt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't run into </span><span>Hubery</span><span> earlier and taken him to the hospital, he would've been home by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't been delayed, he wouldn't have been on the road when he saw Lily in trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're a university student. Don&rsquo;t you have any sense of personal safety?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily listened to his rant with an indifferent expression, then simply responded, "Thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she hadn't known he was friends with Darren and Barnett, she might have actually developed a good impression of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What a pity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Birds of a feather flock together. Anyone who can become friends with someone like Barnett is definitely not a good guy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan frowned. He hadn't said all that to get a casual thank. He wanted her to realize she shouldn't be wandering around alone at night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was about to say more, but through the rearview mirror, he saw her turn her head toward the window, gazing at the passing streetlights with a cold, indifferent expression. That detached attitude immediately killed any desire to continue lecturing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car sped down the road. Finally, it pulled up to the gate of </span><span>Orley</span><span> University of Technology.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The university gate was deserted, the dim glow of a few streetlights barely illuminating the entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan, exasperated, snapped, "Get out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily, unfazed by his tone, said nothing. She simply opened the door, stepped out, and walked straight toward the campus entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was when she realized that the curfew had already passed. The main gate was tightly shut, and the security office lights had long been turned off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood at the entrance, staring at the tightly shut gate, her brows knitting slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Forget it. I'll just go home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning around, she walked along the road toward home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan sat in his car, watching Lily's retreating figure, finding her stubbornness both exasperating and amusing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't get into the school, yet she refused to ask for his help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he did was scold her a little, and that was for her own good. Now she was throwing a tantrum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He considered leaving her be, but it was already past 11 at night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she ran into trouble again, if some thug harassed her, he would never forgive himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sigh, Ethan started the car and slowly pulled up beside her, rolling down the window. "Get in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily kept </span><span>walking,</span><span> her tone indifferent. "I don't need your help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Irritated, Ethan slammed the horn. The sharp sound startled Lily, making her jump.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She spun around, glaring at him. "What's wrong with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan sighed, his voice laced with frustration, "I should be asking you that. You're a girl, why insist on being out so late? What if that guy had actually hurt you? And even if you got away and back to school, the gates were locked. Were you planning to wander the streets all night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily met his gaze. Her eyes were cool, but there was a stubborn edge to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at her, Ethan softened his tone. "Get in. I'll take you wherever you need to go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was giving her a way out, and there was no point in letting pride make her suffer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her home was over 18 miles away. Walking back would be a nightmare, and she would probably end up with blisters all over her feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily got into the car. The ride was quiet, aside from Lily occasionally giving him directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car moved steadily through the night until they reached her home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's house was in the countryside, a self-built home surrounded by silence, broken only by the occasional bark of a dog.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when she reached the door, she realized it was locked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never expected this. Her mother hadn't come home but had gone back to the Hawke Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To make matters worse, she had left in a hurry earlier and hadn't brought her house key.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, her only option was to find a hotel, but there wasn't a single one nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily stared at the sky, speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still in the car, Ethan watched her standing there, unable to go inside, looking utterly helpless. A chuckle escaped him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, you're not pretending you can't get in just so you can follow me home, are you?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="132.html">« Prev</a><a href="134.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
