Even though 'The Garden' only needs final touches, it'll still take me at least a month. I'll strive to finish before Madam Hawke's birthday celebration."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian nodded, his gaze softening. "At your command."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora flushed slightly at his words. She glanced at him, relieved to see his calm expression, and convinced herself she'd imagined any hidden meaning. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Together, they rose and walked out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice clapped her hands gleefully. "I knew Julian would adore someone as wonderful as Aurora! Look&mdash;they're going on a date!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley chimed in, "I've never seen Mr. Hawke act so </span><span>tenderly</span><span> toward anyone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy felt a swell of happiness for Aurora. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since leaving the Elvador family, </span><span>Aurora</span><span> ha</span><span>d</span><span> grown happier each day. </span><span>She no longer looked sad and worried like</span><span> before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian drove slowly into the city. Before long, they arrived at a store named "Embroidery Heaven." After parking, he opened the car door and shielded Aurora's head with a courteous hand. "We're here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora, flustered by his courtesy, thanked him, and they stepped inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shop radiated traditional charm. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's eyes widened at the dazzling array of embroidery supplies&mdash;colorful silk threads, intricate fabrics, delicate needles, and ornate hoops neatly arranged on shelves. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She moved to the racks, carefully selecting materials while Julian lingered behind, watching her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He watched her focused selection and felt his heart soften.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora occasionally picked up some materials, examined them, and then placed them in the shopping basket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian waited patiently, occasionally helping her reach items from higher shelves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For thirty minutes, Julian waited patiently, occasionally retrieving items from higher shelves. Once her selections were complete, they paid </span><span>the bill </span><span>and exited into the warm, golden sunlight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The serenity shattered when a familiar voice rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawke</span><span>, what a coincidence</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian looked up to see Adolph approaching with measured steps. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tailored suit and polite smile masked an unreadable gaze. Though addressing Julian, his eyes never left Aurora's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora froze at the voice. Instinctively, she gripped Julian's arm and looked up at him, her face pale and body trembling. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian, recalling Ethan's intel, understood her fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph closed the distance, eyes fixed on Aurora. Her figure seemed eerily familiar, but he hesitated to name her outright&mdash;after all, why would Aurora associate with Julian? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed a closer look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian frowned, sensing Adolph's intent. Without hesitation, he pulled Aurora against his chest, burying her face in his jacket. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there something you need, Mr. Sherwood?" he asked coolly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph ignored Julian's frosty tone. "Nothing. Just want to say hello." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tilted his head. "And who </span><span>is the lady</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's heart pounded. Her nails dug into her palms as she clung to Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My fianc&eacute;e," Julian replied, his voice steady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's heart raced uncontrollably, pounding so fiercely she feared it might burst from her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pressed tightly against Julian's chest, she could distinctly feel the steady, powerful rhythm of his heartbeat thudding against hers&mdash;his calm pulse intertwining with her frantic cadence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere thickened abruptly, as if the very air had solidified around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The world seemed to fall silent, leaving only the synchronized sounds of three sets of breaths and pounding hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph's face tensed up, his smile turning tight and forced. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Aurora with stubborn intensity, as if trying to piece something together. The more he looked, the more familiar she seemed, and suspicions started twisting in his mind. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I see," </span><span>He uttered, after what seemed like forever,</span><span> "</span><span>Pleasure to meet you</span><span>. I'm Adolph</span><span> </span><span>Sherwood."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's body locked rigidly against Julian. She dared not utter a sound&mdash;even a whisper would betray her identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian narrowed his eyes in warning. "My fianc&eacute;e is unwell. She can't say hello."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With practiced ease, he tightened his grip and lifted Aurora securely into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instinctively, Aurora wrapped her arms around Julian's neck, burying her face against his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian swiftly opened the car door with his free hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph stepped closer, straining to glimpse her face, but Aurora concealed herself completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian carefully settled her into the backseat, using his broad frame to shield her from view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their </span><span>were only inches away from each other</span><span>&mdash;close enough to share breaths. Julian's warm exhales grazed Aurora's neck, reigniting the frantic rhythm of her pulse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cheeks burned crimson, eyes wide with panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian leaned down, his lips brushing her ear as he murmured, "I'm here. Don't be afraid."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gentle yet unwavering words worked like a spell, slowly steadying her tremors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Straightening, Julian closed the car door and turned to face Adolph with eyes like frozen steel. "If there's nothing else, Mr. Sherwood, we'll take our leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Julian moved toward the driver's seat, Adolph glared at the tinted windows, frustration simmering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dark film rendered the interior invisible, yet his instincts roared that the woman was undoubtedly Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without warning, he lunged forward and jerked the door open.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="80.html">« Prev</a><a href="82.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
