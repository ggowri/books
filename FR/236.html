Laura said firmly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm really sorry, Mom. It won't ever happen again," Aurora apologized, her voice full of sincerity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a short pause, she asked, "If it wasn't Celeste who called the cops, then who on earth did?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin chimed in, "The guy's last name is Lowell. We're heading over to their place right now to give him our thanks for saving you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lowell?" Aurora repeated, her mind suddenly racing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of a sudden</span><span>, she remembered bumping into Darren the night before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Could it be that Darren was the one who called the police?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they finally reached Darren's house, Aurora's hunch turned out to be spot-on. He was, without a doubt, the hero who'd alerted the law.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She </span><span>was counting on Celeste to report </span><span>her </span><span>missing, but she just couldn't hack it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for Darren, </span><span>Aurora </span><span>might've ended up on an operating table, getting sliced open.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren greeted the Barron family like long-lost friends, practically doing a little jig when he caught sight of Aurora.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dashed over, grabbing her hands in his, his eyes shining like stars as he stared at her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He exclaimed, practically bouncing with excitement, "Aurora? Is it really you?</span><span> </span><span>I can't believe I'm standing right in front of the country's whiz-kid scientist!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Professor Barron, you're like a god to me. The ultimate role model, hands down!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren was so over the moon that he was at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora found his over-the-top enthusiasm a bit much, especially when she thought about how he used to be so snarky with her in her past life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after he'd learned the truth and mellowed out a bit, that carefree, spoilt-rich-kid aura still clung to him like glue.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, seeing him look at her with such star-struck admiration was a real curveball.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora tried to yank her hands free, but Darren had a grip tighter than a vice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Julian stepped in, shouldering Darren out of the way and pulling Aurora into his arms in one swift motion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren scowled, clearly ticked off. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you?" he snapped.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian kept his cool, his expression as distant as a star in the sky. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm Aurora's fianc&eacute;," he said matter-of-factly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren was left speechless, his jaw practically hitting the floor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Professor Barron has a fianc&eacute;?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">You've </span><span style="font-style: italic;">gotta</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> be kidding me! How can she be engaged?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">She's a genius and so young. She must be off her rocker to be tying the knot at this age!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren felt like his heart had been run over by a truck. He hadn't even had a shot at asking her out, and now he was already getting his heart broken.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he watched Julian hold her close, jealousy gnawed at him like a ravenous beast, and he found himself grinding his teeth in frustration.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To show their thanks for Darren's life-saving act, Benjamin decided to throw the Lowell family a bone in the form of a multi-billion-dollar business deal.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren's parents were over the moon.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, the Lowell family was well-off in Orley, but they were small fry compared to the bigwigs in Putnam.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Landing a contract like this would catapult them to the top of the heap in Orley, making them the richest family in town.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a stroke of luck, </span><span>and </span><span>it felt like a dream come true.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After giving their heartfelt thanks to the Lowell family, the Barron family made their way back to Putnam.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's homecoming was bound to stir up a hornet's nest in the community, and true to the prediction, the Barron Estate was swarming with visitors.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like a never-ending carnival, with people coming and going non-stop.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, the guests had mostly been business associates, but now, the Barrons were attracting a motley crew from all walks of life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their influence had spread far beyond the business realm, and they were becoming a force to be reckoned with in multiple circles.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Naturally, Joe, Oliver, and Dora were over the moon when they heard that Aurora was back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dora practically leaped into Aurora's arms, grinning from ear to ear. "You have no clue how green with envy my classmates are that I'm friends with a genius scientist like you!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joe and Oliver wore the same proud smiles on their faces.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Aurora was the </span><span>youngest one </span><span>of</span><span> the </span><span>group</span><span>, her past experiences had made her seem wiser and more down-to-earth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She loved watching them fool around and have a ball, relishing the cozy atmosphere of their friendship.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time around, the people surrounding her weren't shooting her down with mockery and sarcasm like in her previous life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, she was wrapped in a warm blanket of happiness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what really made Aurora's heart sing was finally being reunited with Lily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After kicking back at home for about a week, the president of MIT extended an invitation to Aurora to head back to her alma mater and give a talk to the students.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a no-brainer for her; she didn't see any reason to say no.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, what really threw her for a loop was spotting Lily in the crowd after the speech.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was when it dawned on her that in this life, she hadn't just turned her own life around; she'd also changed Lily's fate.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe it was written in the stars from the get-go that they'd become friends.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first time Lily laid eyes on Aurora on TV, she felt this strange, magnetic pull towards her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily was itching to get to know Aurora, but then she thought about Aurora being a child prodigy who got into college at the ripe old age of five. That made her second-guess herself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily didn't think of herself as a genius, but she wasn't one to throw in the towel. She hit the books hard, always snagging the top spot in her class.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She fast-tracked her studies and, at just fourteen, scored a spot at MIT.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She became the second-youngest SAT whiz in the school's history, right behind Aurora.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Aurora setting such a high standard, the school had high hopes for Lily, too.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's biggest aspiration was to walk in Aurora's shoes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that she was Aurora's junior at MIT, she secretly hoped that one day they'd be colleagues.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this dream in her heart, she signed up for </span><span>the university</span><span>, longing for the day she'd finally cross paths with her idol.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Aurora wrapped up her speech, a horde of excited students swarmed around her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was star-struck, their eyes lit up, all vying to get Aurora's autograph.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Aurora's eyes zeroed in on one person... Lily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily was only fourteen at that moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had always known she was a </span><span>really smart</span><span> girl.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, though, Aurora had accidentally pulled Lily into a downward spiral.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd caused Lily to break an arm, and later, Lily's quest for her revenge had led her down a violent path.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy, such a kind-hearted soul, had raised a daughter full of compassion. And it was because of Aurora that Lily hurt so many people.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora knew she owed a huge debt to both Lily and Daisy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's eyes welled up</span><span> with tears</span><span>. It seemed the din of the crowd had gradually faded. Her heart pounding, she sauntered slowly towards Lily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily had been on cloud nine when she saw Aurora step onto the stage.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, as Aurora drew nearer, it was like an electric current shot through her, and her heart started thumping even harder.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Aurora's looking at me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is Aurora seriously coming my way?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was completely thrown off by Aurora singling her out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cheeks flushed with excitement, her mind was racing a mile a minute, but she stammered, "Aurora, can I... can I get your autograph?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora halted right in front of Lily and grabbed the paper and pen Lily offered without a second thought.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a few quick flicks of the pen, she scrawled her signature.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd went wild, cheering even louder than Lily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily took the autographed </span><span>paper,</span><span> over the moon with happiness. She was at a loss for words, not knowing what to blurt out next.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she heard Aurora ask, "What's your name?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh, I'm Lily Walker," she replied.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's eyes nearly popped out of her head in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Aurora's asking for my name!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Oh my god&mdash;she's so nice! I can't believe it&mdash;I'm dying to give her a hug!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily stared at Aurora, her heart soaring like a kite in the wind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora continued, "Lily, it's really something that you got into MIT at such a young age. You're one smart girl</span><span>. T</span><span>hat's for sure. I bet you'll grow up to be a real asset to our country. I'm looking forward to the day we work together."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="235.html">« Prev</a><a href="237.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
