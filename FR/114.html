One command from the boss, and subordinates have to risk life and limb. Even with my million-dollar salary, I'm still at the boss' mercy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up, Ethan stepped on the accelerator. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black car shot forward like a panther, speeding through the rainy night toward Hawke Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the window, the curtain of rain split apart as the car raced through it, only to merge again instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's mind worked furiously, like a precision machine scanning every sector of </span><span>Elvador Group. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He strategized how to pinpoint its fatal flaw within hours and push it into irreversible collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rain continued relentlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett had been kneeling in the downpour for over two hours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was as pale as paper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he collapsed, sending water splashing everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren watched silently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a resigned sigh, he bent down and dragged Barnett into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then hurried into the driver's seat and sped toward the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The windshield wipers swung frantically, struggling to clear the relentless rain, yet Darren's view remained blurred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His brows furrowed as he glanced repeatedly at the unconscious Barnett in the rearview mirror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't fathom why Barnett would torture himself this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The harm done to Aurora was an unhealable wound. His </span><span>self-torment</span><span> meant nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren </span><span>wondered</span><span>, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Does Barnett not care about Aurora? No. He obsesses over her&mdash;not wanting her to cry, refusing to let her escape. To earn her forgiveness, he even groveled in the rain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But does he truly care? Time and again, he's hurled insults and violence at her for Bertha's sake. He humiliated her, shattered her hopes, and left her disabled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Barnett's actions are too contradictory, too baffling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If he'd shown Aurora even </span><span style="font-style: italic;">just a bit of</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">kindness when she returned to the Elvador family, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">things would&rsquo;ve been total different</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">With her academic brilliance, Aurora should've thrived after graduation, living a radiant life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But the past can't be rewritten. The harsh truth remains. Aurora's life is ruined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Barnett may look pitiful now, but he deserves no sympathy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The night deepened, darkness swallowing the city. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morgan sat in Elvador Group's office, frantic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dialed Barnett's number repeatedly, but no one answered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, </span><span>Barnett lay unconscious in a hospital bed, burning with fever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperate, Morgan called the chairman&mdash;only to hear the cold tone of a powered-off phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Elvador Group facing unprecedented bankruptcy and its leaders unreachable, Morgan paced </span><span>in </span><span>the office anxiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The endless night finally passed. Morning sunlight pierced the clouds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rain had stopped, leaving the air fresh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett stirred awake. His phone rang the moment he opened his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello..." His voice was hoarse and weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Elvador! Where have you been? I've been calling </span><span>you </span><span>all night! Come to Elvador Group immediately&mdash;it's bankrupt!" Morgan's panicked voice trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!" Barnett bolted upright, eyes wide with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Explain yourself. What do you mean bankrupt? Everything was fine yesterday. How could Elvador Group collapse overnight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given Elvador Group's size, toppling it in a night should've been nearly impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the group was already riddled with critical financial and tax loopholes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind its glamorous facade lay a hollow shell, fragile and crumbling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan hadn't even needed a full night to destroy it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett rushed to Elvador Group without changing out of his hospital gown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at the entrance, police blocked his path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett roared, "What are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elvador Group is suspected of tax evasion. As its legal representative, you must cooperate with our investigation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words struck like lightning, freezing Barnett in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't shocked by the tax evasion&mdash;but by the title "legal representative."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How? When did I become the legal representative? I never signed anything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the police escorted him into the patrol car, he remained in disbelief, scrambling to recall recent events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't remember signing any documents to become the legal representative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew the enormous risks a legal representative faced if Elvador Group engaged in illegal activities&mdash;imprisonment, fines, even criminal charges. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These consequences could ruin him financially and destroy his reputation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was precisely why major company owners rarely took on the role of legal representatives themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impossible! This is absolutely impossible!" Barnett snapped back to reality, thrashing wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've made a mistake! I'm not the legal representative! I know nothing about this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the officers remained unmoved, coldly informing him that resistance was futile and he must cooperate with the investigation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, Ethan arrived at Hawke Estate with dark circles under his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He flung his exhausted body onto the sofa and sighed contentedly, "I survived!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley, who was cleaning nearby, smiled indulgently at his antics. "You overworked again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's eyes were barely open as he sniffled pitifully. "I pulled an all-nighter.</span><span> </span><span>If Mr. Hawke were an emperor, he'd definitely be a tyrant. I'm still young, but he's already squeezed me dry..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ethan, do you have complaints about me?" Julian's deep, magnetic voice suddenly echoed through the living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan jolted upright, plastering a bright smile across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"None at all! In my heart, you're the sun in the sky, warming my icy soul every day!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he pressed a hand dramatically over his heart, feigning utmost sincerity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley and Daisy burst into laughter, instantly lightening the atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian descended the stairs and sat across from Ethan, raising an eyebrow. "How did it </span><span>go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan puffed out his chest. "Not only did I bankrupt Elvador Group&mdash;I also made a major discovery."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused deliberately, trying to pique Julian's interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian showed no enthusiasm for Elvador Group matters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He picked up a financial newspaper from the coffee table, leaned back on the sofa, and asked casually while skimming the pages, "What is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan cleared his throat. "Elvador Group's chairman, Joshua, sold off his shares long ago.</span><span> </span><span>All the proceeds were transferred to an account under a woman named Isabella Steele.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elvador Group's capital chain was broken, and it had massive financial and tax issues. Even without our intervention, it would've collapsed soon.</span><span> </span><span>Also, the legal representative was </span><span>secretly</span><span> </span><span>changed to Barnett months ago&mdash;all seemingly orchestrated by Joshua."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian, initially disinterested, set down the newspaper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected Elvador Group to be hollowed out and Barnett was framed in one move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>What the hell was Joshua thinking?</span><span>" Julian said slowly, narrowing his eyes with biting sarcasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan couldn't wrap his head around Joshua's motives either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He destroyed his own empire, funneled the money to his mistress, and threw his son under the bus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his eyes, </span><span>Joshua's actions were utterly </span><span>weird and out of touch</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaning back, Julian drummed his fingers on the sofa arm. "I'd planned to toy with Barnett longer. </span><span>Too bad, he&rsquo;s still as useless as ever</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly. He's probably in handcuffs by now," Ethan replied. "As the legal rep, he'll likely get years in prison."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they spoke, an urgent voice suddenly rang out at the villa's entrance. "Daisy! Let me in! I need to confirm something important with Aurora!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="113.html">« Prev</a><a href="115.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
