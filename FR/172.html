She tried to negotiate with Julian. "Mr. Hawke, I can just grab a ca</span><span>b</span><span>. </span><span>L</span><span>et Ethan drive you all home</span><span>.</span><span> It would be </span><span>easier</span><span> for me to go back alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Julian could even respond, Aurora jumped in, her tone soft but insistent. "Lily, you haven't heard? There was a brutal attack near a bar last night. It's all over the news</span><span> now</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The poor victim </span><span>got his eyes ripped out, tongue cut off, bones crushed to dust.</span><span> He was found at dawn and rushed to the hospital, but despite the doctors' best efforts, he didn't make it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's eyes went all puppy-dog. "Streets </span><span>ain't</span><span> safe at night. Please, let Ethan drive you. We'd feel better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy chimed in, nodding vigorously, "Yeah, Lily, I get it. You hate </span><span>being a burden</span><span>. But this is </span><span>life or death</span><span>. </span><span>C</span><span>ouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t live with</span><span> myself if </span><span>some freak got you in a cab</span><span>!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily held back an eye-roll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Aurora and Daisy, she was just a sweet, </span><span>innocent</span><span> girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But actually, that vicious "attacker" they were fretting over was none other than Lily herself. They would never imagine this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A heavy darkness settled in her chest. Last night... yeah, she'd definitely crossed a line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could've just ended him right there, but that would've been too easy. Too merciful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, she'd wanted him to suffer. To wake up every morning wishing he </span><span>were</span><span> dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Funny how quickly he'd given up anyway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a waste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily plastered on a fake smile and pushed her food around her plate, her mind a million miles away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the table, her fingers worked lightning-fast, shooting off a quick text to Samuel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fifteen minutes later, his reply came: [I'm outside.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily set down her fork with a soft clink. "Mom, Aurora, I'm done. You guys take your time. </span><span>Gotta </span><span>get</span><span> back before the dorm locks up.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora smiled warmly, "Alright, go ahead. </span><span>See you tomorrow after class&mdash;we're throwing you a nice birthday party at the Grand Hotel. Noon sharp."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily flashed a quick grin in return, then stood and made a beeline for the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan shot to his feet almost instantly, trailing close behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But by the time he stepped out of the room, Lily was already darting out of the restaurant. In one fluid motion, she hopped onto Samuel's motorcycle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's face darkened, a storm brewing in his eyes. "Lily, stop right there!" he bellowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't even spare him a glance. "Go, now," she snapped at Samuel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan</span><span> wasn't worth her time</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel shot Ethan a smug look, flipped him the double birds, and cranked the throttle. The motorcycle roared to life, peeling out of the lot like a shot arrow, vanishing into the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold laugh ripped from Ethan's throat. "Go ahead, run. Makes the hunt more fun."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wind whipped past as Samuel sped through the darkness, Lily clinging tightly to his waist, her body leaning into his. The rush of air howled in her ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, feeling any better tonight?" Samuel shouted over the noise. "If you're up for it, how about we hit a bar?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's reply was clipped, icy. "Not interested."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then where to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>C</span><span>ampus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel wavered, his voice going soft. "It's not even late. Maybe we could-"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, a blinding beam of light sliced through the night behind them, followed by the deep, rumbling growl of an engine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A car was gaining on them at an alarming speed. In a heartbeat, it pulled level with Samuel's </span><span>motorcycle</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily glanced over, and her gaze locked with Ethan's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her stomach dropped.</span><br><span>Damn it! How the hell is he keeping up? Why won't this asshole back off?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Speed up," she urged Samuel, her voice sharp and frantic. "Don't let him catch us. </span><span>I don't care where we end up&mdash;just lose him!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel's face split into a wild grin as he cranked the throttle. The motorcycle surged forward, tearing </span><span>down</span><span> the</span><span> </span><span>road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's Maybach kept pace, its sleek frame a relentless shadow. He wasn't about to let them slip away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His knuckles went white on the wheel, jaw clenched, eyes locked on his prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Maybach's high beams blazed, eating up the distance between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, in a flash, Ethan seized his moment. He yanked the wheel hard, tires screeching against the asphalt as the car carved a sharp arc. Sparks flew, lighting up the road like fireworks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a jolt, the Maybach swung in front of </span><span>the motorcycle</span><span>, forcing </span><span>it</span><span> to a grinding halt by the roadside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel ripped off his helmet, fury blazing in his eyes. He stormed toward the car, fists clenched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell is wrong with you, you psycho?" he roared, ready to throw down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan didn't miss a beat. He stepped up and threw a haymaker that sent Samuel eating dirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Samuel could get his bearings, Ethan's boot found his ribs, leaving him writhing on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan stalked past him, zeroing in on Lily like a heat-seeking missile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood her ground, face twisted with rage and panic. "What's your damage?" she snapped, voice rising. "I've spelled it out for you like you're five. Last night was a drunk mistake. Can we just bury it and move on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not even pissed about it, so why are you being such a drama queen? Jesus, are you really this pathetic?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words tumbled out in a rush, but Ethan seemed deaf to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stalked up to her like a predator, all power and menace. Then, he grabbed her head and crushed his mouth against hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's eyes widened in shock, her body freezing for a split second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When </span><span>her brain kicked back in, she lost it.</span><span> She reared back and slapped him hard across the face. "</span><span>Y</span><span>ou done yet?" she yelled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's head snapped sideways, but instead of anger, a faint smirk tugged at his lips. He tongued his cheek as if savoring the sting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In one swift move, he bent down, hoisted Lily over his shoulder, and started walking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shrieked, beating his back like a drum, legs going wild. "Put me down, you psycho!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan didn't flinch. He carried her toward the Maybach with steady, unshakable steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car's headlights bathed them in a harsh glow, illuminating Ethan's crisp suit, its fabric glinting with a steely sheen, and Lily's skirt, fluttering wildly in the breeze, adding a touch of chaotic beauty to the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the rest of the world seemed to fade into the background, leaving only the two of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the car, Ethan yanked open the back door and tossed Lily inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She barely had time to right herself before he climbed in after her, pinning her down and slamming the door shut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the tight confines of the car, Lily squirmed beneath him, her breaths coming fast and ragged. "What do you want from me?" she stammered, nerves fraying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's gaze bored into her, dark and intense. "Can't you tell what I want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was low, rough with barely restrained hunger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily turned her face away, refusing to meet his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled darkly, "Still so stubborn. Guess I'll just have to make you listen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hands </span><span>started exploring</span><span> every inch of her, raw and hungry.</span><span> Lily thrashed wildly, fighting to break loose, but he had her locked down tight</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air in the car turned electric, heavy with tension and raw, dangerous heat.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="171.html">« Prev</a><a href="173.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
