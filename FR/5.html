It was ironic, she thought.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">He only started to care about her studies after her life had been ruined.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">She&#x27;d poured everything into her studies, desperate to forge her own path. Just when her dreams were within reach, they shattered against the wall of wealth and privilege.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">With a few careless words, the Elvadors had condemned her to hell.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">She could have had it all. Growing up, she&#x27;d known she didn&#x27;t have the family connections others did. All she had was her determination to excel in school. Her dream had been crystal clear: Vertar University, graduate school, a PhD, then becoming a professor. She&#x27;d wanted to stand at the front of a classroom, helping others like her—fighters, underdogs—change their lives.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">However, reality had slapped her hard in the face.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Instead of becoming who she dreamed of being, she became a pariah, an ex-convict despised by society. The stain on her record would follow her forever, tainting her life in every possible way.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Her hands balled into fists, nails digging deep into her palms, but she barely felt the pain.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">&quot;I went to Orley High School,&quot; Aurora said softly.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Her quiet words felt like a thunderclap to Joshua, Celeste, and Barnett, who all stared at her in stunned silence.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Orley High School had the highest academic entrance requirements in the entire region.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">It was a school for the best and brightest. Unlike Herren High School, the exclusive private school where money talked, Orley High School was about scores and nothing else.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">The fact that Aurora not only got in but consistently ranked first in her year proved her exceptional abilities. With grades like hers, Vertar University would have been within reach.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">&quot;That&#x27;s impossible! You&#x27;re lying!&quot; Barnett&#x27;s voice rose, trembling with disbelief. &quot;Orley High is in the suburbs, over 18 miles from home. You used to ride that beat-up bike...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">He froze, the realization hitting him mid-sentence.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Aurora noticed the growing pallor on his face and curled her lips into a mocking smile. &quot;Now you know why I&#x27;d rather ride a bicycle than go to school with Bertha. We weren&#x27;t even in the same school.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">&quot;I never had breakfast with you because Orley High started morning classes at six. I had to wake up at four, ride for two hours, and make it on time.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">&quot;I couldn&#x27;t come home for lunch—the trip was too long. With no money for food, I&#x27;d just drink water to get through until evening.&quot; Her voice cracked. &quot;By the time I made it home, you&#x27;d all finished eating. All that was left were scraps, but I ate them anyway. And you&#x27;d laugh, saying that&#x27;s all I deserved, watching me eat &#x27;like a street dog.&#x27;&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">&quot;Aurora, I&#x27;m so sorry.&quot; Celeste&#x27;s tears streamed down her face, her voice full of sorrow. &quot;It&#x27;s all my fault. I didn&#x27;t know you suffered so much.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">&quot;You&#x27;ve done nothing wrong,&quot; Aurora said quietly, her eyes distant as she looked at Celeste&#x27;s tear-stained face. &quot;You didn&#x27;t raise me, so of course you feel nothing for me. I&#x27;m used to it by now. Even if things were worse, you would think I could handle it all.&quot; Her voice turned cold. &quot;Isn&#x27;t that right, Mrs. Celeste Elvador?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Celeste&#x27;s sobs abruptly stopped.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Aurora&#x27;s words echoed with a familiar sting. They reminded Celeste of something she&#x27;d said long ago: &quot;Aurora, I&#x27;m begging you. You&#x27;re stronger than Bertha. You can endure more hardship. You survived just fine in that orphanage. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll adapt to prison too. Please, take the blame for Bertha.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">The memories she&#x27;d buried for five years surged back, hitting her like a storm. Celeste clutched her chest, as though the pain might overwhelm her.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Aurora watched her falter, her expression cold and disdainful.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">The place where Bertha had pushed Camille down the stairs had security cameras.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">But right after it happened, Celeste had deleted the footage that could have proven Aurora&#x27;s innocence. Without it, Aurora had no way to defend herself in court.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">&quot;That&#x27;s enough!&quot; Barnett snapped. &quot;Stop playing the victim. Sure, we weren&#x27;t perfect, but look at yourself! You tormented Bertha just because you were jealous of her life. People don&#x27;t like you because of who you are, not because of us. And now you have the nerve to point fingers?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">&quot;Barnett, don&#x27;t speak to your sister like that,&quot; Celeste murmured through her tears.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">&quot;Mom, you&#x27;re still defending her? She&#x27;s been using our guilt to act out! Otherwise, why would she push Camille down the stairs and frame Bertha? We had no choice but to send her to prison for five years. Now she&#x27;s holding a grudge and humiliating us in front of everyone at this party!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Celeste looked at Aurora only to find her staring back with a cold, mocking smile that cut like glass.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Unable to hold that piercing gaze, Celeste looked away, guilt twisting in her stomach.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">&quot;Enough. Let&#x27;s stop this,&quot; Joshua said, his tone heavy with authority. &quot;Aurora, why didn&#x27;t you tell us you were coming home? If we&#x27;d known, your mother and I could&#x27;ve prepared a dress for you.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Aurora froze.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">&quot;You didn&#x27;t know I was being released today?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">&quot;Of course not. If we&#x27;d known, I would&#x27;ve sent a driver to pick you up. How did you get here, Aurora?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Aurora turned her icy gaze to Barnett. &quot;Mr. Elvador drove me here. He said you&#x27;d planned a welcome party for me.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">&quot;A welcome party? I thought this was Bertha Elvador&#x27;s birthday celebration.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">&quot;It is! The invitation specifically said &#x27;Bertha Elvador&#x27;s Birthday.&#x27; Since when did this turn into her welcome party?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">&quot;A welcome party for an ex-con? Please. We wouldn&#x27;t have shown up if we&#x27;d known.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">The whispers rippled through the crowd like wildfire.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Barnett&#x27;s face burned with embarrassment. He opened his mouth to explain but couldn&#x27;t form a single coherent word.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Aurora&#x27;s chest tightened as reality hit her. How naive she&#x27;d been. Today was Bertha&#x27;s birthday—that&#x27;s all it was to Joshua and Celeste. They hadn&#x27;t even remembered she was getting out today.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">And Barnett&#x27;s promise of a welcome party? Just another empty lie to shut her up.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">The tiny spark of hope she&#x27;d let herself feel now seemed pathetically foolish.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Aurora turned to leave, unwilling to endure any more pretenses.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">But before she could step away, a young girl in a white feathered designer gown rushed toward her. Aurora tried to dodge, but with her injured leg, there was no way to move fast enough.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">They collided with a loud bang.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">The impact knocked Aurora to the ground. Pain shot through her elbow and leg, sharp and unrelenting.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Her pale face grew even paler as she clenched her jaw, waiting for the pain to subside.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">When she finally looked up, she saw them huddled around the girl in white, cooing and fussing.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">&quot;Bertha, sweetie, are you alright? Where does it hurt? Are you injured?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">The girl&#x27;s eyes welled with tears, her face flushed pink. &quot;Dad, Mom, Barnett... it hurts so much...&quot; she whimpered.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">They swarmed around her, hands fluttering anxiously. &quot;Where exactly does it hurt, darling? Did Aurora hurt you when she ran into you?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Barnett whirled on Aurora, face twisted with rage. &quot;Can&#x27;t you watch where you&#x27;re going?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Chapter 6 The Ruined Dress</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Aurora felt a surge of anger welling up inside her.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">She braced herself with both hands to stand, but her injured leg made her wobble unsteadily.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Gritting her teeth, she glared at Barnett with venom. &quot;Mr. Elvador, what gives you the right to say that? She clearly ran into me, and yet you&#x27;re blaming me for that. Is this just a habit of yours now? Accusing me without any proof?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">&quot;You...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">&quot;There are so many people here watching. Do you dare to ask them what actually happened? Was I the one being unreasonable, or are you the one throwing baseless accusations?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Barnett quickly glanced around, noticing the subtle but meaningful gazes from the surrounding guests.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">These people were all prominent figures of high society. Though they looked down on Aurora for her criminal record, their refined manners wouldn&#x27;t allow them to distort the truth.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">One guest broke the silence, speaking up for fairness, &quot;Mr. Elvador, it was indeed Ms. Bertha Elvador who ran into her. We all saw it.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">With someone leading, others began to nod in agreement.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Barnett&#x27;s face turned to stone, his eyes cold. In his mind, this was all calculated—Aurora deliberately crashing Bertha&#x27;s birthday party, trying to humiliate the Elvadors in front of high society.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">He thought he had her all figured out. Just another bitter, spiteful girl playing her games. After all, if she could frame Bertha five years ago, what was stopping her from tormenting her now?</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Barnett furrowed his brow and said grimly, &quot;Even if Bertha bumped into you, it was unintentional. Couldn&#x27;t you have stepped aside? You did it on purpose.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Aurora felt her blood boil at his words, her vision blurring with rage.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">She didn&#x27;t know how Barnett could say something so absurd.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Anyone with common sense could see she was limping, barely able to walk, let alone dodge.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Then it hit her.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">She remembered when she&#x27;d left prison, how Barnett had sneered at her limp, convinced she was faking it.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">He&#x27;d seen Bertha get knocked down, but conveniently forgot that Aurora had been sent crashing down too.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Since they were so keen on blaming her, Aurora decided she no longer owed them any courtesy. Bowing her head, she raised her sleeve in full view of everyone.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Her elbow was a mess of blood and torn skin, the vivid red shocking to the eye.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Her palm was also scraped and bleeding, with drops of blood sliding down her fingers and falling to the floor.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Aurora lifted her arm high, ensuring everyone could see the wounds clearly.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">&quot;You think I did this to myself? That I&#x27;d hurt myself just to get yelled at by Mr. Elvador? Is that how pathetic you think I am?&quot; Her voice broke, her eyes red with unshed tears and bitter resentment.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Barnett&#x27;s eyes widened at the brutal marks on her arm and palm. His face flushed hot with shame, unable to meet Aurora&#x27;s eyes.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Celeste dropped Bertha&#x27;s hand and rushed to Aurora, her hands hovering anxiously. &quot;Oh my god, Aurora, you&#x27;re bleeding! Does it hurt?&quot; She leaned closer, afraid to touch the wound. &quot;Here, let me...&quot; she cooed, blowing gently on the injury, her concern almost believable.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">&quot;Aurora, I&#x27;m so sorry,&quot; Bertha choked out between sobs. &quot;I just—I panicked when I saw the damage to the custom dress Barnett got me. I didn&#x27;t mean to run into you.&quot; She wiped her tears. &quot;Please don&#x27;t be angry with him. He only lashed out because he was worried about me. Let me apologize for him, please?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Aurora watched the familiar scene unfold: Bertha&#x27;s delicate features crumpling into tears, her gaze soft and wounded. Though she spoke of making amends, her performance painted Aurora as the villain—just like it always had. For three years in the Elvador house, this had been Bertha&#x27;s go-to act whenever she tormented Aurora. </p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Five years later, and she was still playing the same game.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">&quot;So what you&#x27;re saying is that Barnett&#x27;s concern for you gives him the right to slander me?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Aurora&#x27;s voice was icy, her gaze sharp, her entire demeanor exuding a bone-chilling coldness.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">&quot;No, that&#x27;s not what I meant,&quot; Bertha stammered, shrinking back into Celeste&#x27;s embrace as if frightened by Aurora&#x27;s imposing presence. Her tears fell harder. &quot;Aurora, how could you misunderstand me like this?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Celeste hugged Bertha protectively, letting out a helpless sigh. &quot;Aurora, you&#x27;re wrong about Bertha. She&#x27;s always been thoughtful and well-behaved, nothing like what you&#x27;re accusing her of. It&#x27;s her birthday today. Just apologize, wish her a happy birthday, and let&#x27;s put this behind us.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Aurora raised her eyebrows. &quot;This isn&#x27;t the first time something like this has happened. Do you really not know whether I&#x27;m wrong about her? Do you need me to remind you of what happened five years ago...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">&quot;Enough!&quot; Celeste&#x27;s face turned pale, her voice heavy with guilt. &quot;Don&#x27;t bring it up again!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Aurora let out a bitter laugh, her tone dripping with mockery.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Her own mother was still the same as five years ago, choosing Bertha over her without hesitation.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Celeste couldn&#x27;t bear to see Bertha suffer the slightest grievance but had no problem subjecting her biological daughter to endless pain and humiliation.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Aurora felt her heart grow cold.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Forcing herself to endure the pain, she straightened her back and limped toward the door.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">She&#x27;d barely taken two steps when a firm grip caught her arm. &quot;Explain,&quot; Barnett demanded.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">&quot;Explain what?&quot; Aurora shot back, not bothering to hide her irritation.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Barnett opened his mouth to snap at her, but something in her bitter stare made his chest constrict. He took a breath, keeping his voice level. &quot;What happened to Bertha&#x27;s dress?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Bertha&#x27;s custom dress, with its layers of shimmering feathers, sparkled beautifully under the light. But at the hem, a chunk of feathers was missing, as if they&#x27;d been ripped off.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Aurora clenched her fists, trembling with anger.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">&quot;So, Mr. Elvador, you believe I deliberately ruined your sister&#x27;s dress?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">&quot;You were the only one in my car, the only person who had access to the dress,&quot; Barnett replied.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Bertha&#x27;s tears flowed freely as she choked out, &quot;Aurora, why would you do this?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Celeste, unwilling to scold Aurora but unable to stand Bertha&#x27;s distress, sighed and said softly, &quot;Aurora, I understand you&#x27;re upset, and that&#x27;s why you acted out. Let&#x27;s leave it at that, but don&#x27;t do it again...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Aurora&#x27;s cold laugh cut her off. Fixing Celeste with an unyielding stare, she said sharply, &quot;Mr. Elvador&#x27;s car has a dashcam. The footage will show whether or not I touched Ms. Bertha Elvador&#x27;s dress.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">&quot;To clear my name, I demand that you take out your phone and show the dashcam footage right now.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Her boldness made Bertha panic.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">&quot;Aurora, there&#x27;s no need to check the footage,&quot; Bertha said quickly.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Celeste chimed in, &quot;Aurora, don&#x27;t make a scene. The guests are watching.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Finally, Joshua, who had been silent until now, stepped forward. &quot;Let&#x27;s end this here. Aurora, you should go tend to your wounds.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Aurora had anticipated their attempts to brush things under the rug.</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">Her body shook with rage as she jerked away from Barnett&#x27;s grip. &quot;So that&#x27;s it? You won&#x27;t check the footage, but I&#x27;m supposed to take the blame for her dress?&quot; </p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;">She let out a harsh laugh. &quot;I&#x27;m ready to face the truth. What about you? What are you so afraid of?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;text-indent:2em;"></p><div class="pagination"><a href="4.html">« Prev</a><a href="6.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
