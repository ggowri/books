The tidal wave of grief that surged through him threatened to crack his ribs from within. </p><p>His daughter&#x27;s expectant gaze—so bright, so trusting—sent a thousand needles piercing through his chest. </p><p>How could he extinguish that light with the cruel truth? Yet deception would be its own betrayal. </p><p>Julian knelt down to his daughter&#x27;s level. </p><p>With a gentle voice, he said, &quot;Sweetie, Mommy had to go live with the stars now.&quot; He pointed up at the sky. &quot;She can see you every night when you look up, and she wants you to be the happiest little girl in the whole world.&quot;</p><p>The child absorbed this with solemn understanding. A shadow flickered across her face—quick as a cloud passing over the sun—before she beamed up at him. </p><p>&quot;Then let&#x27;s go home, Daddy!&quot; Her resilience shattered what remained of his composure. </p><p>As he gathered her feather-light frame against his pounding heart, her small hand rose to pat his damp cheek. &quot;Don&#x27;t be sad,&quot; she whispered. &quot;When you hurt, I hurt here.&quot; She pressed a tiny fist to her chest. </p><p>The simple wisdom in her words undid him completely. &quot;You&#x27;re right, my brave girl,&quot; he rasped, kissing her hair. &quot;No more tears.&quot; </p><p>As he bent down to lift her into his arms, she suddenly stopped him. &quot;Daddy, wait! Must say bye-bye to Uncle Ethan!&quot;</p><p>Julian paused mid-step and turned back toward Ethan&#x27;s house.</p><p>Inside, the air was thick with the smell of alcohol, yet everything was meticulously tidy.</p><p>What Julian didn&#x27;t realize was that during her stay here, his two-year-old daughter had already shown a maturity far beyond her age.</p><p>Every day, she quietly cleaned the house and cared for the despondent Ethan without complaint. </p><p>Ethan lay curled on the floor like a discarded puppet, his hollow eyes fixed on Julian without recognition.</p><p>&quot;Three days,&quot; Julian murmured, &quot;then the office. It won&#x27;t fix anything, but it&#x27;ll give the pain somewhere to go.&quot;</p><p>Ethan&#x27;s head lolled up, his eyes empty. His lips parted—a silent protest, a plea, maybe even a curse—but no sound came. Just a slow, defeated exhale as he swallowed the words back down.</p><p>The girl squirmed free from Julian&#x27;s hold, her tiny feet carrying her to Ethan&#x27;s side. She cupped his stubbled cheek, her touch featherlight but grounding. &quot;Uncle Ethan,&quot; she whispered, &quot;take care of yourself. Daddy&#x27;s come for me now. But I&#x27;ll remember you always.&quot;</p><p>Ethan blinked, dazed, before his gaze flickered to Julian. &quot;D—Daddy?&quot; The word was ragged, disbelieving.</p><p>Julian approached, lightly patting his shoulder. &quot;It&#x27;s a long story. She&#x27;s my daughter with Aurora. I&#x27;ll explain everything later.&quot;</p><p>*****</p><p>Julian carried his daughter from Ethan&#x27;s apartment, his arms locked around her small frame as if she might dissolve into mist. </p><p>In the car, she curled against his chest like a contented kitten, gasping in wonder at passing streetlights and shops. </p><p>Her delighted giggles began chipping away at the stone that had settled in Julian&#x27;s heart these past months.</p><p>The Hawke Estate&#x27;s grand doors opened to reveal Beatrice and Ashley waiting anxiously. </p><p>When Julian announced, &quot;This is my daughter—mine and Aurora&#x27;s,&quot; both women went perfectly still. Beatrice&#x27;s hands flew to her mouth as tears overflowed. Ashley swayed on her feet, struggling to comprehend.</p><p>As Daniel explained the horrific truth, Beatrice&#x27;s face crumpled like parchment. She moved toward the child with trembling steps, sinking to her knees. The girl—this living mirror of Aurora—made Beatrice&#x27;s weathered hands shake as she reached out.</p><p>&quot;Come, darling,&quot; Beatrice whispered, arms wide. The child looked to Julian for permission before stepping into the embrace. </p><p>Beatrice clutched her as if holding dawn itself—this miracle child who smelled of sunshine and baby shampoo.</p><p>&quot;Our poor Aurora,&quot; Beatrice wept into the girl&#x27;s hair. &quot;What nightmares she endured... And you, my brave one, how you&#x27;ve suffered.&quot;</p><p>Small fingers patted Beatrice&#x27;s wet cheeks. &quot;Don&#x27;t cry, Great-Grandma. I can help! I know how to fold shirts and stir soup.&quot; The earnest declaration shattered what remained of Beatrice&#x27;s composure.</p><p>Beatrice sobbed harder, her tears pouring out like a flood. Through her cries, she managed to say, &quot;Good. You&#x27;re such a wonderful girl.&quot;</p><p>Once she composed herself somewhat, she asked tenderly, &quot;My darling, what&#x27;s your name?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Jenny Talia!&quot; the child chirped, sunshine in her smile.</p><p>Her response sent a chill through the room, darkening everyone&#x27;s expressions.</p><p>Beatrice&#x27;s knuckles whitened before she consciously relaxed them, smoothing the girl&#x27;s hair instead. &quot;That... that&#x27;s not a proper name for our little princess,&quot; she managed, forcing sweetness into her tone. &quot;Shall we choose something special? Just for you?&quot;</p><p>The girl bounced on her toes. &quot;Yes please!&quot;</p><p>Beatrice&#x27;s eyes found Julian&#x27;s.</p><p>Julian hesitated, memories of Aurora flooding his mind. Finally, he spoke firmly, &quot;Aria Hawke.&quot;</p><p>This name carried layers of meaning, including his deep longing for Aurora and his hope that their daughter would never forget her mother.</p><p>Turning to the child in her arms, Beatrice smiled warmly, &quot;From now on, your name is Aria Hawke. Do you like it, Aria?&quot;</p><p>Aria nodded enthusiastically, her eyes crinkling into crescent moons as she grinned. &quot;Yes! I love it. It sounds like... like sparkles and butterflies!&quot;</p><p>The gap where her front tooth would soon grow only made her smile more endearing.</p><p>The adults&#x27; laughter was tinged with bittersweetness, their eyes suspiciously bright. But Aria&#x27;s joy was contagious, and soon the grand halls of Hawke Estate, once heavy with grief, rang with new life.</p><p>Every day, Beatrice played with Aria, teaching her letters and numbers.</p><p>Ashley doted on Aria endlessly, cooking up all sorts of delicious treats. Aria especially adored Ashley&#x27;s homemade pastries, always eating until her little belly was round and full.</p><p>Julian threw himself back into work, channeling his energy into rebuilding his routine. Yet every evening, without fail, he rushed home to spend time with his daughter.</p><p>He read bedtime stories, took her on walks in the garden, and watched with pride as she grew healthier, stronger, and more vibrant each day.</p><p>Time flew by. In the blink of an eye, two years had passed. By now, Aria was four years old and ready to start kindergarten.</p><p>Each morning and afternoon, rain or shine, Julian personally dropped off and picked up Aria from school.</p><p>One sunny noon, as parents lined up to collect their children after dismissal, Aria stood alone near her teacher, patiently waiting while the others left hand-in-hand with their parents.</p><p>The young teacher knelt beside her, smiling warmly, &quot;Aria, are you tired standing here? Want me to carry you?&quot;</p><p>Aria shook her head, her chubby little face breaking into a grin, revealing a set of pearly white teeth. &quot;No, thanks. If you carry me, you&#x27;ll get tired too!&quot;</p><p>The teacher melted at the sight of her adorable charge.</p><p><em>Oh my god, she&#x27;s so cute!</em></p><p><em>No wonder Mr. Hawke rearranges his entire schedule just to pick her up, </em>she mused. <em>Who wouldn&#x27;t—</em></p><p>Just then, a woman suddenly appeared before them. </p><p>Her eyes were filled with desperation and frantic determination as she scooped Aria into her arms without a second thought. Holding her close, she murmured urgently, &quot;Aurora, my Aurora! You&#x27;ve been waiting for Mommy, haven&#x27;t you? Don&#x27;t worry. Mommy&#x27;s here now. I&#x27;m taking you home.&quot;</p><p>The teacher gasped in alarm, &quot;Who the hell are you? Let go of Aria!&quot;</p><p>She rushed forward, trying to pry the hysterical woman off, but the stranger clung to Aria with a grip as strong as iron, refusing to let go.</p><p>Aria was utterly stunned by the sudden turn of events. Her small face turned pale in an instant, her wide eyes filled with pure terror. Her tiny body stiffened as fear gripped her heart.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m not Aurora! I&#x27;m Aria!&quot; Aria cried out, her voice trembling with panic. She squirmed and kicked desperately in an attempt to break free. But the woman&#x27;s arms held her like steel vices, trapping her no matter how hard she struggled.</p><p>A flicker of madness flashed in the woman&#x27;s eyes as she tightened her hold on Aria. &quot;No, you&#x27;re Aurora. You&#x27;re my daughter. You look just like her. You must be her!&quot;</p><p>Her voice carried an eerie, obsessive determination, sending chills down the spine. Her fingers dug mercilessly into Aria&#x27;s tender arm, her nails pressing deep enough to leave angry red welts.</p><p>Despite her maturity, Aria was still just a child. The sharp pain made tears flood down her face as she let out heart-wrenching, panicked sobs.</p><p>&quot;Daddy! Great-Grandma! Help! I&#x27;m scared!&quot;</p><p>The teacher, frantic, screamed for help, &quot;Security! Someone, please help! A child is being taken!&quot;</p><p>In an instant, the kindergarten guards rushed over, quickly surrounding the out-of-control woman.</p><p>One of them shouted firmly, &quot;Let go of the child, or we&#x27;ll have to use force!&quot; But the woman, lost in her panic, tightened her grip on Aria.</p><p>&quot;No one can take her from me! She&#x27;s my daughter. She&#x27;s everything to me! I won&#x27;t lose her again!&quot;</p><p>The woman wailed, her voice cracking. &quot;It&#x27;s all my fault. I didn&#x27;t take care of you... and that&#x27;s how the bad people took you!&quot; Her body trembled violently, tears streaming down her face.</p><p>Aria sobbed uncontrollably, her tiny hands gripping the woman&#x27;s clothes. &quot;I don&#x27;t know you! Let me go! I want Daddy. I want Great-Grandma...&quot;</p><p>The woman&#x27;s eyes burned with desperation. &quot;No, you&#x27;re my daughter. Come home with me. We&#x27;ll never be apart again.&quot;</p><p>Just as the struggle became even more desperate, Julian arrived at the kindergarten.</p><p>From a distance, he spotted Aria in the arms of a stranger, screaming and crying in sheer terror. His chest tightened.</p><p>A cold, burning rage flickered in his eyes. Without a second thought, he stormed forward. He seized the woman&#x27;s arm and twisted it hard.</p><p>She shrieked, a sharp, high-pitched cry, and immediately lost her balance.</p><p>Julian effortlessly scooped Aria into his arms, holding her close. Then, with one swift kick, he sent the frantic woman crashing to the ground.</p><p>Aria clung to him, her little arms wrapped tightly around his neck. Her tear-streaked face buried against his skin as her sobs came louder, muffled in his embrace.</p><p>&quot;Daddy, I was so scared,&quot; she cried.</p><p>Julian rubbed gentle, soothing circles on her back, his voice low and soft.</p><p>&quot;Shh, it&#x27;s okay now, sweetie. Daddy&#x27;s here. Sorry I&#x27;m late.&quot;</p><p>Slowly, Aria loosened her grip just enough to look up at him. Her cheeks were wet with tears, but there was a flicker of determination in her wide eyes.</p><p>&quot;Daddy&#x27;s the best daddy in the whole world,&quot; she whispered, her voice shaky but sincere.</p><p>Those words hit Julian deep. Something inside him cracked open. He leaned down and pressed a tender kiss to her forehead.</p><p>&quot;I promise, sweetheart. I&#x27;ll never be late again.&quot;</p><p>Aria gave a small nod, sniffled, and tucked her head back into the safety of his arms. She tried to stop crying, but little hiccups kept slipping out as she nestled closer to him.</p><p>Julian&#x27;s chest tightened. </p><p>His precious daughter—the little girl he had loved and protected for two whole years, the one who had never shed a single tear—was now sobbing like her world had just fallen apart. </p><p>The sight of her trembling in fear because of some madwoman filled him with a mix of rage and heartbreak.</p><p>Then he looked down at the figure sprawled on the ground—and froze.</p><p>He knew that face.</p><p>It wasn&#x27;t just some stranger. It was Celeste.</p><p>Celeste struggled to sit up, eyes wild with desperation as she stared at Aria.</p><p>&quot;Aurora! My Aurora!&quot; she cried, stretching a trembling hand toward the child.</p><p>A bitter smirk tugged at Julian&#x27;s lips.</p><p>Late affection is pathetic and meaningless.</p><p>Back when Aurora was being torn apart by the Elvadors, Celeste hadn&#x27;t said a word. Not once.</p><p>And now? Now that Aurora was gone, she suddenly appeared—confusing Aria for her.</p><p>This so-called motherly love, showing up after everything, made Julian sick to his core.</p><p>&quot;Take her away,&quot; he said coldly. &quot;Send her back to the psych ward. I don&#x27;t ever want to see her again.&quot;</p><p>Daniel stepped forward and grabbed Celeste by the arms.</p><p>She kicked and screamed, completely losing control. Her sobs were loud, broken, her face soaked with tears and snot.</p><p>&quot;No! I&#x27;m not going back! I just want my daughter—I just want Aurora!&quot;</p><p>Her gaze locked onto Aria, desperate, pleading.</p><p>&quot;Aurora, baby, come home with Mommy, okay? Mommy misses you... I miss you so much... &quot;</p><p>Aria buried her little face even deeper in Julian&#x27;s chest, her small frame trembling with fear.</p><p>Julian held her tighter and got into the car.</p><p>&quot;Don&#x27;t leave! Give her back to me—give me my daughter!&quot;</p><p>Celeste&#x27;s screams tore through the air, raw and hysterical, as Daniel wrestled to keep her restrained.</p><p>Holding her in place, Daniel leaned down and sneered coldly, &quot;Your daughter died two years ago. It&#x27;s time to face reality.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No! That&#x27;s not true!&quot; Celeste cried, her body shaking all over. &quot;Aurora&#x27;s alive. She has to be! She&#x27;s going to live a long, happy life...&quot;</p><p>Her voice cracked, then crumbled into broken whispers. &quot;Aurora... Aurora...&quot;</p><p>As her mind slipped further into chaos, her pitiful state might have stirred sympathy in some. But not Daniel. Not even a flicker.</p><p>He personally escorted her back to the psychiatric hospital, making sure she was locked in tight.</p><p>&quot;Mr. Hawke said to keep a close eye on her,&quot; he told the director, his voice sharp.</p><p>The director nodded, sweat dripping down his forehead. &quot;Of course, sir. We&#x27;ll make sure she never escapes again.&quot;</p><p>After Daniel left, Celeste was shackled with iron chains. </p><p>From that day on, they never came off.</p><p>Heavy cuffs clung to her ankles—cold, unyielding. A lifetime sentence of regret, madness, and longing for the daughter she couldn&#x27;t save.</p><p>Ten years later.</p><p>At fourteen, Aria had blossomed into a tall, radiant teenager, standing at five-seven and still growing. </p><p>When Aurora returned to the Elvador Villa, the contrast was clear. </p><p>Joshua, Celeste, Barnett—they were all tall, broad-shouldered, and statuesque. But Aurora? </p><p>She was delicate, tiny, as if she didn&#x27;t belong. Her small frame and fragile presence made her seem like a guest in her own home.</p><p>The tragedies that marred Aurora&#x27;s life never touched Aria. </p><p>As the Hawke family&#x27;s cherished gem, Aria wanted for nothing. </p><p>Even without a mother around, she was enveloped in love—protected, cherished, adored.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="200.html">« Prev</a><a href="202.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
