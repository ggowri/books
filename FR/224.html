His eyes were devoid of any paternal affection.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only cold disdain lingered there, his lips curling into a cruel smirk.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slowly, he reached down, lifted the sleeping baby from the bassinet, and slipped out of the room without Celeste noticing a thing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua watched the screen in real time</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>H</span><span>is </span><span>eyes widened</span><span> in sheer panic.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's fake! Turn it off! Turn it off now!" he barked frantically, lunging for the remote control.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could grab it, two burly security guards pinned him down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The footage shifted again, this time showing an orphanage under the cover of night.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua stood at its entrance, holding the newborn Aurora in his arms.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sneer twisting his face, he dropped her unceremoniously onto the doorstep like she was nothing more than trash.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Consider yourself lucky I'm keeping you alive," he growled, glaring down at the defenseless infant. "If not for your potential usefulness later, I'd have tossed you to the dogs."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice dripped with venom as he added, "When you grow up, if your kidney matches Isabella's, we'll take it out and give it to her. That's all you're good for."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With one final contemptuous snort, Joshua climbed back into his car and sped away, leaving the child abandoned in the darkness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua felt his world crashing down around him. He was doomed completely.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted in outrage, their gazes burning holes through him. Gone was any trace of sympathy; only hatred remained.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He lied through his teeth earlier. He just wanted to manipulate public opinion against the Barron family!" someone spat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You disgusting piece of work! How dare you use us as pawns?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've never met anyone so vile in my life. You don't deserve to be called a father."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As accusations flew thick and fast, Celeste stormed into the room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, she launched herself at Joshua, slapping him hard across the face twice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard! Look at what you've done! I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her shrill scream echoed through the hall as her sharp nails raked across his face, leaving angry red welts in their wake.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Celeste, you've lost your mind! Get off me!" Joshua roared, trying to fend her off.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You shameless bastard!" Celeste shrieked. "You have no right to take Aurora away from me! She's my daughter, not yours, you filthy scum!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That brat is mine too, remember?" Joshua shot back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine then," Celeste snapped. "We're getting a divorce."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think a divorce gives you custody of my daughter? Think again."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The couple descended into chaos, hurling insults and objects at each other.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wine glasses shattered against walls, cakes splattered everywhere, and the once-elegant banquet hall became a battlefield.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin and Laura watched in horror, their temples throbbing visibly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was supposed to be Aurora's academic celebration, a milestone they cherished deeply. Yet here it was, ruined beyond repair.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua and Celeste had ruined Aurora's birthday bash last time, and now they had taken it to a whole new level, crashing her party. They trashed the place, smashing everything in sight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough!" Benjamin bellowed. "Guards, throw them out immediately!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A team of black-clad security personnel materialized, restraining Celeste and Joshua with practiced efficiency. As they dragged the squirming pair toward the exit, Celeste fought tooth and nail.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go of me! I came here for my daughter!" she screamed, desperation lacing every syllable. "That scumbag Joshua stole her from me! I'm her mother. I've always loved Aurora. You have no right to keep her from me!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin and Laura exchanged a glance, stunned by her words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they despised Celeste, they couldn't deny she had a point. Celeste was also a victim in this twisted web.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They turned their attention to Aurora, who stood silently amidst the chaos.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora," Laura began softly, kneeling to meet her gaze. "Do you want to go home with your birth mother?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's eyes lit up with hope as she fixed Aurora with a pleading stare.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, believe me, sweetheart. My love for you is no less than what your adoptive mother feels. Come home with Mommy, please. I promise I'll give you all the love you deserve."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora merely glanced at Celeste briefly before turning her gaze back to Benjamin and Laura.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, Dad," she said calmly, "there are some things I need to say to them. May I?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura placed a gentle hand on Aurora's head.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, honey. Say whatever you need to."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their reluctance to let her go, they knew Celeste was Aurora's biological mother.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Aurora chose to leave with Celeste, they would have no choice but to accept it, even if it tore them apart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Aurora took deliberate steps toward Celeste, Benjamin's brow furrowed in worry, while tears shimmered in Laura's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Celeste practically vibrated with excitement, unable to contain her joy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, my sweet girl," she blurted out, beaming. "Have you finally come to your senses? Are you ready to come home with Mommy?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I knew it," Celeste continued. "My precious daughter would never abandon me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora tilted her head upward with an icy expression. "Crouch down," she commanded coolly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Celeste blinked, caught off guard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Crouch down," Aurora echoed firmly. "I have something to say to you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Celeste watched Aurora, she detected a subtle discord in her expression. A flicker of detachment screamed Aurora had no intention of going home with Celeste.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nevertheless, Celeste complied, lowering herself cautiously. "What is it, sweetheart? What do you want to tell Mommy?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora leaned closer, her proximity making Celeste's heart swell with triumph. She shot a smug glance at Benjamin and Laura.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">See? Blood ties always win. Even after five years apart, Aurora still craves my love, just like last time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But inside, Benjamin and Laura felt their hearts sink.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had truly adored Aurora, truly cherishing her as if she were their precious daughter in every sense.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the moment her biological mother emerged, Aurora gravitated toward her without hesitation, drawn to her like a moth to a flame.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it really be that the time they had spent together was too fleeting for Aurora to have forged a bond deep enough to rival that primal pull? Or was it possible that the love they had poured into her heart simply hadn't taken root as deeply as they'd hoped?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear gripped them as they worried Aurora might choose to leave.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go ahead, darling," Celeste beamed and whispered. "What do you want to say to Mommy?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's lips brushed dangerously close to Celeste's ear as she let out a hushed whisper meant for them alone, "Celeste, do you really think you're the only one who's been reborn?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste froze, disbelief etched across her features as she whipped her head around to stare at Aurora.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When their eyes met, the mocking glint in Aurora sent a jolt of terror coursing through her veins.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you..." Celeste stammered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora sneered. "That's right. I came back too, and earlier than you. I was reborn the moment you gave birth to me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora continued, "Don't assume everything has changed just because you got a second chance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This version of you isn't any different from the last one.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember that day in the children's clothing store when you sided with Bertha and treated me like dirt? It wasn't any different from how you behaved in our past life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Face it, Celeste. You're selfish, arrogant, hypocritical, stupid, and cruel.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What makes you think I'd ever forgive someone like you?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In both this life and the last, I will never forgive you. If you truly regret what you've done, then stay far away from me. Never show your face in front of me again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And just so you know, I have parents now who adore me. I have a good brother. I'm not the helpless Aurora you used to torment. I'm their princess.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, and I imagine you're curious why the Barron family adopted me, aren't you? Well, here's the truth. In our previous life, they tried to adopt me too. But I stayed behind for the jerk Hubery and rejected their offer.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looking back, I was such a fool. I wasted my time on people who didn't deserve me, letting them blind me to the incredible parents I could have had. If only I'd been adopted back then, I wouldn't have ended up so broken that I would carry the weight of a disability because of you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words poured out. Each one was a steel needle plunging deep into Celeste's heart, twisting with cruel precision.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why? Why did it have to be this way? Isn't it enough that fate grants me a second chance at life? Why does Aurora have to be reborn too? Aurora will never forgive me.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="223.html">« Prev</a><a href="225.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
