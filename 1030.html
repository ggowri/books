  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Osborne activated his interdimensional travel and closed the six-mile gap like it was nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reappeared right behind the sixty Class S clones, precisely where he had planned to be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he materialized, all sixty pairs of eyes turned toward him. They were Class S clones, after all&mdash;sensitive to even the faintest fluctuations in space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's arrival hadn't gone unnoticed; he was instantly locked onto by every clone in the vicinity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their reflexes were lightning-fast. Recognizing him as an enemy, several clones launched their attacks without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this, too, was part of Osborne's strategy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His focus remained on his true targets: the eight Class S Vampire Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blood coursing through the veins of these Vampire Kings surged like a raging river&mdash;they were not like ordinary folk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their blood was potent, the source of their power, enabling them to manipulate their enemies' blood as if it were a weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Vampire Clan was notorious for this ability, earning them the name Blood Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Osborne? He was the progenitor of the Blood Clan, a level above these Vampire Kings in a hierarchy that was crucial to their kind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The higher-ranking vampires could easily dictate the fate of the lower-class.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Osborne aimed to take them down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The command rippled through the ranks of the Class S clones, and their response was immediate; they surged to attack. Osborne's presence had been barely a blip on their radar, as he only emanated the energy of a Class AAA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, just the nearest Titan Kings went for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was also part of the plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had anticipated that only the closest Titan Kings would react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their movements were clumsy compared to other foes&mdash;the Tauren Kings and Wolf Kings packed a serious punch, while the Medusa Queen had the ability to turn others to stone and confined his agility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring the Titan Kings' attacks, Osborne unleashed his martial art aura and pointed directly at the eight Vampire Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!" Osborne called out with fierce determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, his target shifted from physical flesh to the very blood coursing through his enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A powerful jolt rippled through the eight Vampire Kings as they sensed their blood losing control, ramping up in speed as though sent into a frenzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A pressure that felt like it was rooted deep within their souls bore down upon them, paralyzing their bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Explode!" Osborne commanded, his voice piercing the tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blood within the Vampire Kings detonated with explosive force, tearing through their bodies as though they were nothing more than balloons losing air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gouts of blood erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Vampire Kings' faces changed expressions of horror and disbelief. They couldn&rsquo;t move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deafening explosion followed as the Vampire Kings' corpses ruptured from the inside out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not even Osborne's Light of Redemption could save them now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their demise, the circle of the sixty Class S clones shattered, and for the first time, Osborne caught sight of Bryce, who was trapped in the center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But danger loomed; the attacks from the nearby Titan Kings struck down upon him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Titan Kings might not have the sheer brute strength of their counterparts, the Tauren Kings and Wolf Kings, but they were still a terrifying force within their own right. Each Class S Titan King delivered a fierce onslaught against Osborne, their punches echoing like thunder as they crashed into his martial art aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A total of six Titan Kings unleashed their fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it hadn't been for the transformation of his martial art aura, it would have crumbled under such ferocious pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, standing firm, it held steady against their might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now's my chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne absorbed the Titan Kings' blows before launching himself forward. In the blink of an eye, he slipped through the gap in their circle and appeared right beside Bryce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of his Divine Bone surged in his right leg, and with a swift kick, he sent </span><span>the Medusa Queen flying, denying her any opportunity to unleash her petrifying gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With no time to waste, Osborne snatched Bryce back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Light Realm! Light of Redemption!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he enveloped Bryce in the protective glow of his abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Relief washed over him; his plan had finally succeeded!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But would fortune continue to favor him? The answer was shrouded in doubt, for he was now encircled by fifty-one Class S clone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trapped within their midst, Osborne knew the stakes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a dangerous game, and if he couldn't break free, death would surely be the price.</span></p><div class="pagination">
