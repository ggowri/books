        <h1>Chapter 1148 Extinguished</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne swiftly dispatched thousands of flying Ferocious Beasts, the jungle erupted with a deafening roar. In response, even more of these creatures surged forward, intent on overwhelming him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their goal was clear: buy time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, over a hundred thousand Ferocious Beasts had already gathered in the jungle, a terrifying sight. Yet, nearly 200 thousand more were on their way, needing just a bit more time to converge and form a truly fearsome Beast Tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, a few particularly powerful Dark Exotic Beasts were orchestrating the flying Ferocious Beasts, using them as pawns to stall Osborne and delay the inevitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne's Satan's Eye saw through their strategy with crystal clarity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smile crept across his face. "Futile," he muttered, brimming with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he had fully grasped his current strength, Osborne had felt a flicker of doubt. The thought of facing a Beast Tide had once unsettled him, raising concerns about being overwhelmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now? He felt invincible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "With my defenses, even if I'm surrounded by these Beast Tides, I'll be just fine! Their average level is simply too low!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They can chip away at my defenses, but their attacks are too slow to keep pace with my recovery! I can plunge right into the heart of the Beast Tide and strike at will!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then it's time to kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne plunged back into the throng of Ferocious Beasts. For good measure, he enveloped himself in a martial art aura, adding an extra layer of protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he unleashed his full power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No longer relying solely on brute strength, Osborne combined his physical prowess with a surge of powers, launching a barrage of attacks that tore through the Ferocious Beasts with alarming speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, he had wiped out another 20 thousand flying beasts, their blood energy saturating the air around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Drawing on the power of the Blood Cross, he </span><span>swiftly absorbed the blood energy released by the fallen beasts, storing it within the Blood Cross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the energy density of these lower-tier beasts was relatively low, the sheer volume was staggering. The blood energy from 30 thousand slain Ferocious Beasts was equivalent to that of 300 Class S warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And here, there were a full 500 thousand Ferocious Beasts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he took them all down, the blood energy collected would rival that of five thousand Class S warriors&mdash;enough to significantly boost every member of the Blood Demon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's do this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne charged into the jungle, directly into the mass of 100 thousand Ferocious Beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For anyone else, even the most elite Class S warrior, facing such a horde would be a suicide mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To step into that beastly fray was tantamount to signing one's death warrant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne felt no fear. Relying on his insane defenses, he barreled into the heart of the beast swarm, ready to unleash a new wave of carnage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beasts roared in fury, feeling insulted by his audacious charge into their territory. They retaliated with frenzied attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless attacks rained down on Osborne's martial art aura, causing it to pulse violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, no matter how fierce the onslaught, the aura held firm, unyielding against the </span><span>relentless barrage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other hand, Osborne's own strikes were too powerful for the beast horde to withstand. Even the strongest of the Dark Exotic Beasts among them were merely Class AAA; though they possessed intelligence, they couldn't synchronize their efforts like the Blood Demon members to counter Osborne's attacks and mitigate their impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, they simply couldn't keep up with the onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air around the </span><span>Lostridge</span><span> Mountains roared with the terrifying cries of the beasts and the fierce vibrations of battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every second saw a new wave of Ferocious Beasts perishing under Osborne's relentless blows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the Blood Demon members were also busy reaping the lives of the Ferocious Beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't charge directly into the fray like Osborne, but they moved forward like an indomitable bulldozer, grinding down everything in their path and leaving a trail of beast corpses in their wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Anastasia and Zoe couldn't hold back any longer. They were too intimidated to face the horde alone, and since Osborne didn't need their help, they decided to join forces with the Blood Demon Vanguard members, diving into the fray alongside them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their assistance, the Blood Demon Vanguard's killing efficiency soared, multiplying their lethality several times over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe began to utter melodious sound waves, captivating and enchanting. In a radius spanning several miles, every Ferocious Beast, even the Dark Exotic Beasts, found themselves frozen in their tracks, their minds rendered blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, in an explosive flash, a terrifying sea of lightning engulfed them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ominous storm of thunder rolled over the beasts, and when the tempest subsided, the ground was littered with charred remains, a grim testament to the devastation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cataclysmic battle raged on for two long hours before the chaos finally began to settle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the Ferocious Beasts had been dispatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over 50 thousand Dark Exotic Beasts had been sought out and eradicated without mercy; not a single one was left standing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Dark Exotic Beasts' command shattered, the remaining hordes were gripped by confusion and terror, scattering in every direction. However, only a scant few managed to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Beast Tide, which had never fully formed, had already been extinguished!</span></p></div>
