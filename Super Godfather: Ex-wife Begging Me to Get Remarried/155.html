        <h1>Chapter 155 Threat</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne breathed a sigh of relief when he restrained Raymond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was much easier than he expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One reason was that the number of masters around Raymond was less than Osborne thought, and the second reason was that after transforming into a Vampire, Osborne's body was stronger than he had imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were still many powers that he hadn't used yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Class C+ metahuman was not a threat in front of Osborne after he transformed into a Vampire. He could easily defeat the enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "Unfortunately, the power of Blood Cross would become less as I used it. It can only be replenished with my blood. I can't use it at will in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Transforming into a Vampire is my trump card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, what I need to do most is to continue practicing the Breath of Celestial to improve my physical strength and increase the level of Satan's Eye."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking about it, Osborne walked up to Raymond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His blood-red hair bound Raymond. Besides, it seemed that even Raymond's power was also restrained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond could not use his power. It made him feel extremely frightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of power is this? Are you really a Vampire? Why can your hair restrain my power? It's impossible! It's absolutely impossible!" Raymond shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled. He didn't know why, so he didn't answer Raymond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just said calmly, "Raymond, stop shouting. You can't escape now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond wished he could kill Osborne. He warned, "Bastard, you'd better let me go. The Aberrants is my backer. Do you know it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged. "So what? You want to threaten me with the Aberrants, huh? A hundred years ago, it was indeed powerful, but as far as I know, it was defeated by the Godfather decades ago. It had already been kicked out of Rosmandi. Do you think I would be afraid?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond's eyes turned cold when he heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He snorted, "Humph! You're wrong. The Aberrants has long recovered its strength. Soon, it will return to Rosmandi under the leadership of the great King of the Aberrants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Godfather? By then, the King of the Aberrants will defeat and kill him and take back everything that belongs to the Aberrants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you are smart enough and want to survive, you'd better let me go now. I can recommend you to the Aberrants and work for the King of the Aberrants!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing Raymond's words, Osborne narrowed his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "The Aberrants has recovered its strength?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It will return to Rosmandi soon to challenge the Godfather and re-establish the rules of Rosmandi's underground world, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said calmly, "Ridiculous. Decades ago, the Godfather could drive the Aberrants away. Now, decades later, it is even more vulnerable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond sneered, "Brat, you know nothing. You have no idea how powerful the Aberrants is! What's more, the Aberrants is not the only organization that wants to deal with the Godfather."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression changed. "Who else?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond shook his head. "I don't know. Anyway, the King of the Aberrants has found enough powerful allies. The day he returns to Rosmandi, his 100 thousand fellows will sweep across Rosmandi, and the day will also be the end of the Godfather."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face became even colder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued to ask, but Raymond refused to say anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment and suddenly took out a medicine bottle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the truth serum in the bottle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had used the truth serum to get the news that Raymond and Paul would attack Clarissa from Davy, the leader of the Maelstrom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The truth serum?" Raymond exclaimed. His face turned pale. "It's the Class B truth serum? It can work on metahuman below Class B. Damn it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did you get the truth serum? Are you the Godfather's lackey?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond was furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne ignored his anger, pinched his jaw, and forced him to take the truth serum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the truth serum took effect, and Raymond's eyes became dull.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne immediately asked, "Who is the King of the Aberrants? What power does he have?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Raymond opened his mouth as if he wanted to say something, but the next second, his expression changed, and he vomited large mouthfuls of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong?" Osborne was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did Raymond suddenly vomit blood?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond said, "I... I can't expose any secrets about the King of the Aberrants, or I will be cursed and die immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was surprised when he heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that the King of the Aberrants had left some kind of curse on Raymond. As long as Raymond dared to reveal the King's secret, he would immediately vomit blood and even die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The King of the Aberrants actually has such strange power? It's really horrible." Osborne frowned, knowing that he could not continue asking Raymond about the King of the Aberrants. If Raymond died, it would be a great loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was far from being on the same level as the King of the Aberrants, so he just left this trouble to the Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking for a while, Osborne asked the question that concerned him most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me the truth. Why do you insist on killing Clarissa?"</span></p></div>
