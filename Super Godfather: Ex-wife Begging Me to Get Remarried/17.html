        <h1>Chapter 17 Throw Them Out</h1>
        <div><p>Once Justin finished speaking, he flashed them a flattering smile.</p><p>Afterward, he looked over at Osborne with a sneer as if to say, “You’re done for.”</p><p>Osborne chuckled and didn’t rush inside. He crossed his arms and indifferently asked, “Did you just say I’m pretending to be a VIP, Justin? Are you suggesting that these people are blind and can’t tell the real VIPs from the fake ones?”</p><p>Upon hearing that, the security guards glared at Justin with menacing faces.</p><p>Justin was startled and quickly explained, “No, that’s not what I meant. I’m just saying he’s a professional scammer. Please don’t be fooled by him.”</p><p>“That’s right. He’s a scammer,” Penelope rushed over and added. “Gentlemen, we know him very well. He’s absolutely not a VIP. He’s garbage.”</p><p>“Aren’t you going to scram, you worthless scum? If they find out you’re faking it, you won’t even know how you died.” She looked at Osborne disdainfully.</p><p>He smiled at the security guards and said, “Why don’t you take their advice and verify my identity? Maybe I really am a fake VIP.”</p><p>The security personnel heard this and immediately nodded politely to Osborne. “Honored guest, we wouldn’t dare. Your identity is unquestionable.”</p><p>Once they finished speaking, both Justin and Penelope were dumbfounded, wondering, “What’s going on?</p><p>What kind of trick did that good-for-nothing Osborne use to not even question his identity?</p><p>Were they still asleep and dreaming?</p><p>Wasn’t Osborne just an orphan, a commoner? The highlight of his life was marrying Ophelia and living with the Caldwell family for those three years.</p><p>Even the Caldwell family heirs had to line up to get in. Why did Osborne get to use the VIP lane?”</p><p>Justin was indignant and determined to expose him.</p><p>He even suspected that Osborne must have bribed the security personnel.</p><p>“Where is your supervisor? I want to file a complaint!” Justin shouted. “You must have taken his bribe. I want to report him. Bring your supervisor here.”</p><p>Just then, a tall, middle-aged woman walked over. “What’s all this commotion at the VIP lane? Do you realize you could disturb the guests?” she demanded sharply, exuding an overwhelming presence.</p><p>Justin was delighted when he saw her and said, “Ms. Lewis, you’re here just in time. I’m Justin from the Caldwell family. I want to report this imposter. He’s just a worthless nobody pretending to be a VIP to sneak into the event.”</p><p>The other Caldwell family members also chimed in mockingly.</p><p>“Ms. Lewis, the manager of Draco Auction House, is here. Osborne is done for. He can buy off the security, but not Ms. Lewis.”</p><p>“Osborne is really in for it now, pretending to be a VIP.”</p><p>“Do you think he’ll get his legs broken?”</p><p>The Caldwell family members eagerly anticipated Osborne’s true identity being exposed and him getting a severe lesson. Even Ms. Lewis couldn’t help but frown as she looked at Osborne.</p><p>Then, she noticed the Draco Star Wristlet on Osborne’s wrist. Her eyes widened in shock, and she hurried over to him.</p><p>She respectfully nodded at Osborne and said, “Honored guest, why didn’t you let us know you were coming? We could have made arrangements in advance. I apologize for any inconvenience caused by these irrelevant people.”</p><p>As soon as she finished speaking, the surrounding area suddenly fell into complete silence, so silent that one could even hear a pin drop.</p><p>It wasn’t only the Caldwell family members. People from other prominent families were also staring at Osborne in disbelief.</p><p>Who was this Ms. Lewis? Her name was Debbe Lewis, and she was the manager of Draco Auction House. Even within the Draco Group, she was considered a mid-level executive.</p><p>In Mayby City, even the heads of noble families had to show her respect. There might be a few people she personally attended to, but none who received such a respectful greeting. Not even the city’s executive officer or heirs of prominent families could command such respect from her.</p><p>Yet now, Debbe was actually nodding politely to Osborne.</p><p>Someone in the crowd asked, “Who is he exactly?”</p><p>“Could there really be someone this significant in Mayby City?” another questioned in astonishment.</p><p>Everyone was utterly shocked, their eyes fixed intently on Osborne. They were already determined to form a connection with him.</p><p>The Caldwell family was left feeling awkward, glancing at each other in bewilderment.</p><p>They wondered, “Isn’t Osborne just an ordinary man? Isn’t he a useless nobody? Why on earth is this happening?”</p><p>Even Ophelia, who had been silent all this time, now looked utterly baffled and at a loss.</p><p>She knew Osborne better than anyone else. He was an orphan with no background. His only relative was a terminally ill sister.</p><p>Ophelia then inwardly questioned what right Osborne had to make Debbe nod politely.</p><p>Even as the Caldwell family’s successor, it was hard for her to get a word with Debbe, let alone make her nod politely.</p><p>“Something is definitely wrong here.” Ophelia refused to believe that Osborne had a secret, powerful background. She was sure he was pretending to be someone else.</p><p>Ophelia stepped forward and said, “Hello Ms. Lewis, I’m Ophelia, the heir to the Caldwell family. I can assure you that Osborne is just a commoner. There’s no way he is a VIP. He could be pretending to be someone else.”</p></div>
