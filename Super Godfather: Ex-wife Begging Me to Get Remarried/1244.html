        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it really that easy?" Osborne mused, feeling a sense of ease wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Eclipsing Mantra wasn't overly complex; it merely required a specific energy flow to mask his own aura and that of his Divine Flame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this technique, other gods wouldn't be able to see the Divine Flame hovering above his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe it's just the first level that's simple," he murmured, shaking off any lingering </span><span>doubts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly activated the Eclipsing Mantra, successfully concealing both his power fluctuations and the presence of his Divine Flame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt a surge of satisfaction. "Unless someone is three levels above me, they won't be able to see my Divine Flame! That means only a Transcendent Deity warrior could catch a glimpse of it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once I master Level Two of the Eclipsing Mantra, even Transcendent Deity warriors won't be able to spot my Divine Flame. Only Celestial Deities will have that privilege!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Level Three? It'll be even more formidable..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a nod of approval, Osborne's mind turned to the next phase of his training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level Two not only promised enhanced effects, but it also had a new application: it could disguise his Divine Flame!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, his Divine Flame was a mere transparent flicker, but with Level Two, he could create illusions of two or even three Divine Flames, changing their colors at will.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was far more practical for him; after all, displaying immense combat prowess without a visible Divine Flame could draw unwanted attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Osborne was about to dive deeper into his training, a shift in the atmosphere caught his attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The gods of the Deschanel family have finally arrived!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne abandoned his thoughts of perfecting Eclipsing Mantra Level Two. The Deschanel family gods had reached the vicinity of the Thornberry family, and there were thirty-six of them brimming with battle intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They paid no mind to the unusual calm enveloping the Thornberry family. Joseph, leading the charge, waved his hand, and the thirty-six gods swiftly fanned out, encircling the Thornberry family's stronghold completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but roll his eyes at their arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Deschanel family is way too confident&mdash;almost cocky! They probably think no one on Blue Planet stands a chance against them. Even if they noticed the Thornberry family's odd behavior, they wouldn't care."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Concealed in the parallel space, he focused his gaze on the Thornberry family's residence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder how they'll react to this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he pondered, a figure suddenly shot up from the Thornberry family's residence, soaring toward Joseph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was an elderly man, strikingly tall with golden hair and blue eyes, radiating an air of superiority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even standing before Joseph, he maintained a calm demeanor, unwavering in his stance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Superior Deity?! And wait&mdash;he looks like Helios! The top-ranked figure in the Global Quasi-Divine Rankings! He's actually a Superior Deity?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shock coursed through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, wait! He has not just three brilliant green Divine Flames above him but also two dimmer Divine Flames! He must have reached the Celestial Deity level at some point!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The implications of this revelation hit Osborne like a freight train.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He whispered to himself, piecing together the puzzle, "What does this mean? Helios isn't some Earthling who popped up two hundred years ago; he's a god who survived the Age of Gods!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His situation must be similar to Grandma Divine Shadow's!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Helios is a god who lingered through the Age of Gods, originally at the Celestial Deity level! He must have awakened over two centuries ago, but the energy in the world was so thin back then that his recovery was painfully slow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yet, even at that pace, it's faster than starting from scratch! That's why he's held the top spot in the Global Quasi-Divine Rankings for so long. After all these years of hiding, he's finally regained his strength as a Superior Deity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but chuckle as he watched the gods of the Deschanel family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, he had been worried that they might easily obliterate the League of Divine Descent. But now, with Helios here, those concerns began to fade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helios was a Superior Deity, after all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, like Joseph, he possessed a Level Four Divine Body. His original realm was even higher than Joseph's, having reached the exalted status of Celestial Deity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a formidable opponent indeed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's face grew grave as he locked eyes with Helios, a cold snort escaping his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helios, in turn, stared back at Joseph, his voice icy. "The Deschanel Clan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's expression hardened. "You know of us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helios gave a casual smile. "During the Age of Gods, the Deschanel Clan was the top divine clan in the eastern part of </span><span>Celestara</span><span>. Your patriarch, Terrence, was a top-tier Deity Overlord. How could I not know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's face grew even more serious. "And who exactly are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helios' smile remained, though it carried a hint of mockery. "You've wiped out twenty-four of our Divine Families, yet you don't know our origins?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's irritation was palpable. "Well, are you going to tell me or not? If not, I'm starting the fight right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helios frowned, hesitating for a moment before finally saying, "We are the Pantheon League."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph gasped. "The Pantheon League? You're actually from the Pantheon League?!"</span></p></div>
