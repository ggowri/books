        <h1>Chapter 1388 The Depth of the Mine Tunnel</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Vance spoke, he led his group into the narrow passageway, hot on the trail of Harry and Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What they didn't realize was that just a few feet away, hidden within the hard rock, Osborne was watching their every move with a darkening expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, his mood turning grim, "So this is Vance's plan! He's taking advantage of my appearance, teaming up with Patrick to punish Harry and Amelia for not delivering three times the required Essence Crystals. They're cornering them, pushing them to the brink, hoping that they'll feel desperate enough to use this path into the depths of the mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They think it's safe, that they won't encounter any </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, and they can gather a bunch of Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An Intermediate Deity paired with five Junior Deities?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia are in for some serious trouble! With their strength, they've got no chance against those odds!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Determined to intervene, Osborne began to follow Vance's group, his mind racing to devise a plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, he could still handle Junior Deity </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> easily because he was the </span><span>progenitor of the Blood Clan, able to suppress their power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But against ordinary human Junior Deities, he felt outmatched unless he took the risk of aggravating his injuries and with all his might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me assess the situation first. If it comes down to it, I might have to throw caution to the wind and fight at risk of aggravating my injuries. No matter what, I can't let anything happen to Harry and Amelia!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He followed stealthily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mine's rocky terrain posed a serious challenge. A passage less than six feet high, stretching over a hundred miles to reach the mine's depths, would be an incredibly tough task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most concerning was the presence of </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> deep within the mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any excavation would inevitably release life energy into the air, likely attracting nearby </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>. If they weren't careful, they could end up being killed and devoured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, truly accessible paths leading into the mine were exceptionally rare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Few ventured into the abyss unless absolutely necessary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Harry and Amelia, unaware of Vance's pursuit, pressed on in the dimly lit tunnel. They had traveled about 12 miles and held a special device that flickered gently in the darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a unique tool used to detect Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While it couldn't pinpoint their exact locations, it could assess the density of Essence Crystals within a hundred yards. The greater the concentration, the brighter the device glowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miners in the mining district relied on these detection instruments to dig up enough Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This area has Essence Crystal fluctuations that are twice as strong as those on the surface! Should we dig for some here?" Amelia exclaimed, excitement lighting up her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry hesitated, shaking his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not yet! Twice the amount isn't enough for us to deliver the required quota in seven days. Plus, even if we find enough, we won't be able to keep much for ourselves. Since we've come this far, we should explore deeper."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, let's keep going," Amelia agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They pressed forward, delving another 18 miles into the mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now they were 30 miles down, and the Essence Crystal detector in their hands began to shine even brighter&mdash;five times stronger than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry exclaimed, finally bringing them to a halt, "Five times the density of Essence Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, let's dig for a bit and see what we find. If we don't get any </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> attacks, we can go even deeper."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sounds good to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without missing a beat, Harry and Amelia sprang into action. Though they were still young, they had been miners for quite some time. Each quickly grabbed their tools and chose a direction, starting to chip away at the hard rock. Even when they </span><span>unleashed their divine power, they could only break off small chunks at a time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Osborne, it was the first time witnessing ordinary human miners extracting Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but admire their determination. It was no easy task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On Blue Planet, once someone achieved godhood, they were elevated above the rest&mdash;part of the elite, with others doing their bidding no matter the task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But here in </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, even someone like Harry, who had reached Intermediate Deity status, was reduced to laboring as a miner, facing the most dangerous and grueling work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the plight of humanity in </span><span>Celestara</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had two choices: join the human resistance, constantly hiding in the wilderness from the ever-present threat of </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> and the relentless pursuit of the Dark Deity Legion, or become slaves and miners under the Legion's yoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched as Harry and Amelia toiled away, sweat glistening on their brows as they dug into the unforgiving rock in search of Essence Crystals. Unable to contain his frustration, he clenched his fists, a silent vow forming in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that I'm in </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, I have to change the fate of its people! </span><span>Celestara</span><span> is a world for humanity; we are its rightful masters, and we will not be enslaved by outsiders!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence! Dark Deity Legion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One day, I will drive you out of </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, and I will make sure you pay for your tyranny!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's resolve hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for now, his priority was to protect Harry and Amelia, the ones who had saved him from certain doom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Harry and Amelia continued their relentless search for Essence Crystals, completely unaware that Vance and his five henchmen had stealthily crept up nearby, ready to strike.</span></p></div>
