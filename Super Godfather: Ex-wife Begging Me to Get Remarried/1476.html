        <h1>Chapter 1475 You're Free</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lachlan Swift, are you really going to set them free? Are you sure you're in your right mind?" Tiana couldn't help but voice her concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled calmly, "I'm perfectly clear-headed! Why wouldn't I do this? I bought them, so they belong to me. I have every right to decide their fate, don't I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana was momentarily speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, yes, of course! But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied firmly, "There are no 'buts' here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not just them, but all the human slaves I purchased today&mdash;please cancel their slave registrations and restore their identities. Let them go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana was utterly taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You spent that much Essence Crystals just to set them free? What's your angle?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She struggled to comprehend his reasoning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mused, "In my decades at the slave market, I've never encountered anyone like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those are top-tier slaves worth over 100 million, and he's just going to let them all go?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is he out of his mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frowning, Tiana said, "Mr. Lachlan Swift, are you worried about Fabian?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, shaking his head. "This has nothing to do with Fabian! Even without him in the picture, I would still help them. I can't stand the thought of my fellow humans being treated as mere slaves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once their registrations are canceled, if they want to leave, they're free to go. If they choose to stay with me, I'll welcome them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned his gaze back to the three women in the cage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be canceling your slave registrations. You can think it over&mdash;whether you want to leave or stay with me. If you choose to stay, I won't treat you as slaves, but you will have to work and follow my orders. It's entirely up to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne moved on to the next cage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other human slaves he had purchased, apart from the over five thousand captives, were being held nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had all heard his previous words, and shock rippled through them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They mused, "Is this guy really going to help us cancel our slave registrations and restore our identities?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If we want to leave, he won't stop us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged incredulous glances, unsure if they had misheard or if there was some hidden agenda at play.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as their cages swung open and the chains binding their hands and feet fell away, even Tiana stood before them, officially canceling their registrations and restoring their identities, disbelief turned into reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stunned, they stared at Osborne, their minds racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked back at them, taking in the sight of 255 individuals: three Celestial Deity warriors, 50 Transcendent Deity warriors, 182 Superior Deities, and 20 Intermediate Deities, evenly split between men and women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that they were free from their bonds and had regained their strength, the security personnel at the slave market were on high alert, fearing an uprising.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a moment before he spoke again, waiting for the 52 hundred captives from the West Zone to be brought over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he addressed the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, you are now free!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know how you ended up as slaves, displayed like merchandise, but you're lucky to have crossed paths with me. I bought you and canceled your slave registrations, restoring your identities. If you wish, you can leave right now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if you want to stick around, I'd be more than happy to have you join me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He scanned the crowd, his expression open and inviting, waiting for their reactions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm giving you ten minutes to make your choice. Those who want to follow me can stay here; I'll come back to take you away. If you'd rather leave, you're free to go at any time. I won't stop you, and neither will the slave market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But let me give you a word of caution: be careful out there. I don't want to see any of you end up back in chains, displayed like merchandise again. You might not be so lucky to run into someone like me next time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned to Tiana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Tiana Hart, where is that special hybrid slave I purchased for 30 million? I'm curious to see what makes her worth that kind of price. Can you take me to her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana regarded him thoughtfully before nodding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's quite unique, and she's not in a cage. Follow me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leading him to a closed door, Tiana paused. "She's inside. You can go in yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, a sense of unease creeping in. "She's in there? Is it safe?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana offered a calm smile. "It should be fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Should be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's instincts kicked in. He knew that the starting bid for a Celestial Deity-level human slave was only 20 million, while this one had been set at 30 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That meant she was likely more powerful than a Celestial Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana's presence made it tricky for him to use his Satan's Eye to assess the situation inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a moment of hesitation, he took a deep breath and slowly pushed the door open, stepping inside.</span></p></div>
