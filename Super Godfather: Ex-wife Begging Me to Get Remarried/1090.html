        <h1>Chapter 1089 Despair</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, despair washed over Wesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap in power was insurmountable; while the Blood Demon members could only fortify the front and back of the canyon, the Eityreia Organization assassins skirted around them, launching ambushes with chilling efficiency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost a hundred Class S assassins moved like shadows, appearing out of nowhere to reap lives before vanishing again into the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if the situation weren't dire enough, a new wave of Class S warriors from the League of Divine Descent appeared, adding fuel to the fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like that, the Aberrants' Class S clones joined the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They found themselves trapped in the canyon, surrounded by an estimated six hundred Class S assailants, while over 30 thousand members of the Augustine family's team began to feel the crushing weight of hopelessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's over!" Wesson's voice trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer number of six hundred Class S warriors was an impossible wall for them to scale. His bracelet vibrated incessantly, but he couldn't afford to divert his attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thoughts raced through his mind. "How to break free? How to secure the survival of as many Augustine family members as possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe... maybe we can only scatter and breakthrough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson's eyes sparked with a hint of madness. Although the enemy was overwhelming, they still had the advantage in numbers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they split up, maybe half of them could survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staying together would only lead to their slow demise, ground down by the onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But scattering meant risking massive casualties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the chaos, the six hundred Class S warriors would seize the opportunity to slaughter them in droves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do I do?" Wesson's desperation clawed at him as agonized screams continued to pierce the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The assassins from the Eityreia Organization treated this like a cruel hunt, toying with them and taking them down one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Emma's voice came. "Mr. Wesson Augustine, we have to fight back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we keep cowering here, we're all going to die! We might not fear death, but dying without a fight? That's not how the Augustine family rolls!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination etched into her features, Emma stepped forward, fierce and unyielding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her boldness, Wesson's heart sank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be reckless, get back! You're one of our best; we can't afford to lose you! You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, a shadowy figure materialized near Emma, brandishing a divine artifact dagger aimed straight at her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma seemed oblivious to the danger, lost in her conviction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was too fast&mdash;one moment, Wesson was pleading for her to return, and the next, he was watching in terror as the dagger hurtled toward Emma's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a shield flew out of nowhere, interposing itself between her and the incoming strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The swallow shield absorbed the impact, the dagger clattering harmlessly against it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The assassin frowned, visibly annoyed, but quickly composed himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sneer, he declared, "Next time, I'll take your head!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before anyone could react, he vanished into the ether, leaving Emma reeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get back!" Wesson shouted, urgency rising in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Emma shook her head defiantly. "Wesson, this is a fight for our lives! I'm part of the Augustine family, too, and I'm Class AAA. Why should I hide back here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have to confront them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's voice rang loud and clear, cutting through the panic that threatened to engulf them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words ignited a fire within the ranks of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right! We fight back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look around! We're surrounded by six hundred Class S warriors! Even if the former Godfather were to wake up now, he wouldn't be able to turn this tide!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the worst that could happen? We're not afraid of dying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fight back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chorus of voices surged, each one laced with a mix of defiance and desperation. The anguished cries of their fallen comrades echoed in the air, a grim reminder that the Eityreia Organization assassins were relentless, continuing their hunt with merciless precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cries of the dying only fueled their rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were like sheep led to slaughter, and they would rather die fighting than be picked off one by one in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's take the fight to them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah! Let's do this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy in the crowd shifted, transforming fear into a fierce determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson watched, his heart heavy with conflict. He knew the risks, but the tide of anger and resolve was too powerful to ignore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amidst the chaos, a flicker of excitement crossed Yulissa's face as she quickly typed a message on her device. Without anyone noticing, she sent out a signal, hoping against hope that help would arrive in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, in an instant, a spatial fluctuation rippled through the air above them, drawing every eye upward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tall figure emerged from a dimensional rift, stepping into the world with an air of authority and purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Osborne, having received Yulissa's coordinates, arriving with the speed of thought itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had traveled less than a hundred miles in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Yulissa finished her message, he appeared like a beacon of hope above them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa exclaimed, her voice bright with relief and joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne! You made it!"</span></p></div>
