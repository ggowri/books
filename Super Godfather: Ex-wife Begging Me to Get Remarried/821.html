        <h1>Chapter 821 Apology and Compensation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne stepped forward, his arms encircling Isa's slender waist.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His voice was earnest as he spoke, "Isa, I truly am sorry! I promise you, this will never happen again! Should it occur once more, you can beat me to your heart's content, and I won't raise a finger in defense."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa's lips curled into a smirk at his declaration.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You'd better watch yourself then. With that frail body of yours, unable to even best an S-class Supreme Overlord, I might just accidentally beat you to death."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne suddenly froze.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was she implying he couldn't defeat an S-class Supreme Overlord?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Among the AAA-class warriors worldwide, who could boast of such a feat?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He believed he was already exceptional.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, a glance at the battered Marvin in the distance silenced Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa was uniquely qualified to make such a claim.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne felt a pang of despair.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When would he defeat Isa?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When could he truly stand tall before her? It embarrassed him that Isa had to come to his rescue each time trouble loomed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He murmured, "Almost there! I've reached Class AAA, matching Isa in rank! It's just my martial art that lags.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I'll surpass her soon!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When the time comes..."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His mind wandered to a tantalizing vision where he pressed Isa against the soft expanse of the bed and teased her at his will. A mischievous smile crept onto his lips.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What delightful thoughts are you entertaining?" Isa asked.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She stared at Osborne as a knowing smile graced her features, "Are you planning to be atop me and bang me at your will?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne choked on his breath. A flush of embarrassment colored his cheeks.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No! What nonsense! How could I possibly entertain such thoughts?" he stammered, attempting to cover his tracks.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa was suspicious. "No need to hide it. I'm yours. Isn't it natural to think that way? But you'll have to work harder. I'm on the cusp of reaching Class S. If you don't keep up, I won't wait for you."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's expression turned serious at her words.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Isa, let's discuss this later. We have more pressing matters, like him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's going to escape!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As if on cue, Marvin staggered to his feet. Terror was etched in his eyes as he glanced at Isa. His earlier confidence was shattered. Without hesitation, he turned to flee.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa's gaze followed him. She smiled.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Escape? I think not.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Get back here!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After her declaration, Isa extended her hand with a swift grace to seize Marvin. Then, she hurled him with force.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin felt an invisible grip take hold of him, yanking him back with ferocious intensity. He was slammed to the ground with such force that the earth itself gave way, cratering beneath him into a significant hollow.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Dazed and disoriented, Marvin looked up to see Isa approaching. Her tone was icy. "Do you believe you have the right to flee before me? I offered you a chance. Kneel, apologize, compensate for the damage, and I'll spare you. It's a pity you didn't seize it.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You bullied my man, so I will bully you in turn. Now, you can die."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon uttering those words, Isa moved to kill Marvin.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin shouted, "Wait!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fear threaded through his voice as he pleaded, "I'm ready to apologize and make amends! Please, I acknowledge my mistakes. I swear, from now on, I will steer clear of him, never causing trouble again. I beg for your forgiveness."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His pleading eyes sought Osborne's.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, I was wrong. I truly know I was wrong. I apologize to you. Please forgive me."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne remained silent. His brow furrowed in contemplation.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Should Marvin be spared so easily?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa's voice cut through the tension, calm yet commanding, "Did you not hear me clearly? I said, kneel and apologize."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Humiliation flashed across Marvin's face.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, under the chilling weight of her murderous intent, he struggled to his feet only to falter, ultimately dropping to his knees before Osborne in a desperate act of submission.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, I was wrong. I apologize to you. Please grant me mercy. I swear that the Williamson family will never dare to trouble you again. I am truly sorry."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once Marvin had spoken his piece, Isa smiled, inquiring, "Are you satisfied with this, Osborne?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne touched his nose.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa responded without hesitation, "It appears my man remains unsatisfied! Lay out your plans for compensation. If your offer doesn't meet his approval, you might as well consider your fate sealed."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her voice was terrifyingly icy.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cold sweat beaded on Marvin's forehead as tension gripped him. With a voice strained by the weight of his predicament, he managed to say, "I am prepared to relinquish a divine artifact in reparation."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A spark of interest ignited in Osborne's eyes, brightening his expression with the allure of the offer.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa only sneered, "What divine artifact? They come in grades: ordinary, premium, top-grade, and supreme. Don't insult us with trinkets of copper and iron. If you do, not only will you die, but I'll erase the entire Williamson family from existence.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Forget about the supreme ones. I doubt you possess any. Just produce a top-grade divine artifact."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that very moment, the air around Isa thickened with a terrifying murderous intent.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A top-grade divine artifact?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin exclaimed with disbelief. However, the icy severity etched on Isa's face sent a shiver cascading down his spine, compelling him to hastily agree. His voice was quivering, "Alright! I'll give you a top-grade divine artifact!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My family possesses only one top-grade divine artifact, and I am willing to offer it as compensation."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa wore a faint smile, "Then fetch it promptly. We'll await your return here. Don't attempt any tricks, or you will die."</p></div>
