        <h1>Chapter 347 The Mysterious Person</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne returned to the Alisa Ship, the battle had ended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This surprised him very much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nine Class B+ members from Ghost Ship were so powerful that the escort team, Ryan, Nathan, and the others had no chance of defeating them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&#8203;Even if Jacob and Layla had arrived back in time, ending the battle in such a short time would have been out of the question.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are the others?" Osborne couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Ryan and Nathan were covered in blood, obviously injured in the battle. They, too, were puzzled.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I-I don't know," Nathan finally replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was even more surprised. A possibility struck him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Did she take action?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he continued, "What exactly happened? Nathan, </span><span>fill me in on it</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan nodded, took a deep breath, and recounted, "Osborne, </span><span>a</span><span>fter your reminder to be alert, we remained on deck. Suddenly, Jacob and Layla hurriedly departed, and we heard distant sounds of fighting at sea. We felt an urgent need to go and offer assistance.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, at that moment, nine men in black flew over. They were so powerful that even with the escort team's support, we couldn't halt their advance. To protect the Alisa Ship and the tourists aboard, we had no option but to engage them in a desperate battle.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nonetheless, we were still no match for them. They broke through our defense, reaching the tourists and causing casualties.</span><span> </span><span>Just when we were in despair, another person in black appeared. He was too fast for me to target.&#8203;</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He quickly knocked out the nine men in black one by one and then took them all away. In just a blink of an eye, they disappeared.</span><span> </span><span>At that moment, Jacob and Layla just returned."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Nathan finished speaking, Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were nine Class B+ strong men. Yet, the mysterious person in black effortlessly beat them all and vanished before Nathan and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&#8203;Osborne was not sure if that person was really who he believed it to be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of contemplation, he said, "Anyway, that person aided us and is not our enemy. Promptly count the casualties among the tourists and contain the incident swiftly. Don't let it escalate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, Osborne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan and Ryan hurried to get busy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne turned his head and peered into the depths of the sea, but the ancient ship with the skull flag was no longer in sight. It had disappeared at some point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite eliminating several key figures from Ghost Ship this time and achieving significant results, he did not acquire much useful information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only person caught alive committed suicide by taking poison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the bodies of several other people were completely corroded soon after, making it impossible to figure out their identities through their remains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ghost Ship!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured, "The leading metahuman this time is called Kyle. According to his speech, there are at least four more people from Ghost Ship who are stronger than him.</span><span> </span><span>Will they </span><span>come to us again</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was uncertain. Ghost Ship remained enigmatic. After such a tragic defeat, nobody could predict its next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the Alisa Ship became quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to Osborne's timely reminder, everything was managed effectively. The ship sustained minimal damage. The only casualties were on the VIP floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ordinary tourists, in their sleep, even had no idea what had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the best result.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne returned to the room, it was almost dawn. After thinking about it, instead of resting, he went to the seventh floor, where the accommodations for ordinary tourists were located.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, among these ordinary tourists, one person stood out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It </span><span>was Isa!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Osborne's invitation, she secretly boarded the Alisa Ship. He suspected that she was the mysterious person in black last night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nine Class B+ members from Ghost Ship were taken away by her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she was in great need of experimental subjects, so it was normal for her to take action when she encountered Class B+ metahumans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knocked on Isa's door. After a while, the door opened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She yawned and looked at him indifferently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what's up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne touched his nose. "Why don't you invite me in to sit down? This isn't the best place to talk."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of hesitation, Isa still stepped aside to let him enter the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not spacious, but certainly not cramped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne immediately caught a strong whiff of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said calmly, "Isa, the person who helped us last night was indeed you! Where are the eight people from Ghost Ship? You captured them alive, right? I have something to ask them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Isa was displeased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, how dare you bring this up! I fought so hard yesterday and finally caught them. I was glad to have experimental subjects. Unexpectedly, they all committed suicide by poisoning themselves. Their bodies were even melted by the poison!</span><span> </span><span>I've lost a lot, okay? I didn't </span><span>gain anything from it</span><span> at all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Isa thought about it, the more upset she became. She rushed forward and grabbed Osborne by the collar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have to make it up to me!"</span></p></div>
