        <h1>Chapter 1373 Out of Danger</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in </span><span>horror,</span><span> his body frozen in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he sensed the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity sharing his despair, its power waning as it failed to control his movements to evade the impending doom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe it thinks there's no way out?" he thought, the weight of hopelessness crashing down on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The massive roots came crashing down, each strike shaking the very fabric of this deep space, tearing apart the spatial tide before it even got close. Osborne felt his Divine Body teetering on the brink of collapse, threatening to disintegrate into its most basic particles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a terrifying assault!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he had never encountered a Deity King warrior, he couldn't shake the feeling that even their most powerful strike would pale in comparison to this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each root seemed capable of obliterating countless planets like the Blue Planet, reducing them to cosmic dust without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this attack had erupted in the vastness of the universe instead of deep space, half a solar system could easily have been annihilated!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was simply too horrifying!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared, dumbfounded, as the roots descended. His mind was blank, devoid of any thoughts of resistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way to block this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No living being could withstand such an onslaught, at least not in Osborne's understanding of divine beings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a peak Deity Overlord or a Deity King would likely be crushed effortlessly by any one of those roots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, there were dozens of them coming at him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Osborne was a Superior Deity, even if he possessed a Level Nine Divine Body, none of it mattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, all he could do was watch as the attack bore down on him, quietly awaiting his demise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, just as despair threatened to engulf him completely, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity erupted with a sudden burst of energy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It surged out of Osborne's body, transforming into an enormous blood-red lotus, a magnificent sight in the depths of space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This colossal flower was as big as a small planet, rivaling the massive roots in size!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the roots struck down, they collided violently with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could see the Lotus' form shuddering, cracking under the immense force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It rapidly dimmed and withered, struggling to withstand the onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the overwhelming power surged back into Osborne, and he felt his Divine Body tearing apart, his soul resonating with a violent shockwave. Before he could even let out a gasp, he was knocked unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In those final moments of awareness, he caught a glimpse of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity desperately fighting back against the roots, buying him precious time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then everything faded to black.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time lost meaning as he drifted into darkness. Eventually, Osborne stirred awake, confusion washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm... alive?" he exclaimed, bolting upright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of pain shot through him, radiating from every part of his body, making him cry out as cold sweat dripped down his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It hurt!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every inch of him throbbed with agony&mdash;bones, flesh, skin, and even each cell seemed to scream in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clenching his teeth, he forced himself to assess his surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he froze in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no spatial tide here. Despite the dimness, it was a stark contrast to the suffocating darkness he had just escaped. Osborne could actually see everything around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air was thick with a sense of decay, rot, and even death, but compared to the absolute silence of deep space, this place felt welcoming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was air!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was matter!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was no longer trapped in the depths of space!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of disbelief and joy washed over Osborne. Not only was he alive, but he had also escaped the oppressive depths of space. Somehow, he had found his way back to a world teeming with life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne still had no clue what happened while he was unconscious or how he managed to survive that terrifying onslaught from the dozens of tree roots, but one thing was certain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was out of danger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, as his senses fully returned, he realized that his body felt gravely injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured to himself, "Am I hurt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why does it feel like I've been through the wringer? What about the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity? If I'm still alive, shouldn't it have healed my wounds?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did it abandon me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or worse, has it perished?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Closing his eyes, he focused inward, scanning his body for any signs of what had transpired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne delved deeper, a sigh of relief escaped his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There, nestled within his heart, he found the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. Though it appeared to be withering, its form hazy and the petals and leaves nearly </span><span>lifeless, it was undeniably still there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint pulse of energy flickered around it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was alive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne relaxed slightly, his heart swelling with gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It dawned on him that it had saved him&mdash;not without cost. To withstand the onslaught of those monstrous roots, the Lotus had likely expended almost all its energy, leaving it in this weakened state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was still alive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as he provided it with enough energy, it could regain its strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, there was something more pressing at hand: he needed to pay attention to his own injuries!</span></p></div>
