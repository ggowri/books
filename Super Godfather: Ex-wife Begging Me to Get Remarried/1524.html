        <h1>Chapter 1523 On-Site Instruction</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Hannah had mentioned that Thunder Power was effective against the Deathborn, Osborne wasted no time in unleashing it against their foes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, the path he walked was unique; his divine power and elemental power could be effortlessly exchanged. If divine power was more effective, he used that; if elemental power was better, he switched to that. Enhancing one aspect naturally bolstered the other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could achieve a perfect balance between the two in half the time it would take most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, his speed in wielding elemental power was unmatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Hannah had already demonstrated her formidable strength, cutting down the Deathborn like grass, Osborne noticed that her control over her power still needed refinement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, her explosive strength was impressive, but her endurance was lacking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In one-on-one combat, this approach could work just fine. After all, if one could take down one's opponent quickly, the weakness of low endurance wouldn't be exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when faced with a large-scale assault, this style had significant drawbacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne decided to use this real battle scenario to teach Hannah how to handle a swarm of enemies effectively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Judgment Thunder Drake!" he called out, summoning a dragon of crackling purple lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under his command, the mighty beast split into countless smaller lightning dragons, darting into the mass of Deathborn with a series of sharp, crackling sounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the lightning dragons struck, the Deathborn erupted in black smoke, their shrieks piercing the air as they fell one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They perished, and the lightning dragons, having exhausted their power, vanished into thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the hundreds of Deathborns in front of him were wiped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first glance, it seemed that Osborne and Hannah fought in similar styles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Hannah's eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your control over power is incredible! Each attack perfectly kills those Deathborns without wasting any energy. If you used even a little less power, they might not die, and you'd have to follow up with another attack. Use too much, and you waste energy...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do you do it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "Calculation! Experimentation! Adjustment! Control! Experience!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah stood frozen, Osborne's words echoing in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, everything clicked into place for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was eager to try it out immediately but hesitated, remembering that her divine power and elemental power still needed to recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Hannah focused on replenishing her energy with the top-grade Essence Crystal, she watched Osborne intently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she could see that his overall power was less than hers, he seemed far more relaxed and at ease in the face of the Deathborn onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While she had fought for less than ten minutes and already felt her divine power draining and her raw power waning, Osborne appeared as if he were taking a leisurely stroll through the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his lower overall strength and attack power, he was dispatching the Deathborn at a pace that matched hers, all while maintaining a steady reserve of divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah murmured to herself, "That's impressive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I feel like he's even stronger than some of the geniuses from the Paramount Supreme Clan! If his level were the same as mine, I might not stand a chance against him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As that thought crossed her mind, her eyes sparkled with newfound determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't been lying when she told Osborne about her past encounters with the young talents from various races; she had faced some of the most renowned prodigies among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In every one-on-one match, Hannah had never been defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even that super genius from the Paramount Supreme Clan had fallen to her, his anger leading him to seek revenge, only to end up severely injured and nearly crippled in their last clash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah had always been brimming with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She believed she stood at the pinnacle of the younger generation of Celestara, convinced that few could match her strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, in the presence of Osborne, she found herself grappling with feelings of inadequacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mused, "How strange! The rumors about Lachlan say he's a bit of a genius, but compared to the prodigies I've faced from the various races, he falls short.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, he wouldn't just be a squad leader in the Wild Flame Army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This Lachlan is nothing short of astonishing! He's not just a genius; he's a freak of nature!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just breaking into Celestial Deity, he toyed with Deity Overlord Fabian, taking out peak Celestial Deity Kerwin and the others. The power he's displaying is completely different from what I'd heard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah stared intently at Osborne, her eyes gleaming with curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that he suddenly had a breakthrough?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, completely unaware of Hannah's internal struggle, was focused solely on controlling his Thunder Power, blasting through the ranks of the Deathborn. Meanwhile, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was quietly absorbing the surrounding high-grade death scent, slowly regaining its vitality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the midst of this chaos, even as the roots of the Lotus had yet to fully recover, Osborne's raw Thunder Power surged unexpectedly, breaking through to Level Six!</span></p></div>
