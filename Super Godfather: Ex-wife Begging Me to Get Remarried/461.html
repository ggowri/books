        <h1>Chapter 461 Defeat Charlie</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trigger was pulled, but no bullet was fired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at him and sneered, "Control shadows? It's a weird power. But how could you want to kill me just like this? It's ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie could control Osborne's shadow but couldn't control his energy. But the energy pistol needed Osborne to inject energy into it before it could be activated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, even if Charlie controlled Osborne's shadow and made Osborne point the pistol at his head and pull the trigger, no energy bullet would appear from the muzzle of the pistol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie's expression suddenly turned cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said coldly, "I think it's simple. But I control your shadow, meaning to controlling your body. If you can't control your body, how can you fight me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled again when he heard that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't control my body? I was just teasing you just now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne started moving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His movements were slow, as if he was stuck in a quagmire and as if something was restraining his body. But in front of Osborne's terrifying power, no restraining force could limit his movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally took a step forward slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But a strange thing happened. Osborne's body had already taken a step forward, but his shadow remained in the same place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His shadow was separated from his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne turned to look at his shadow and couldn't help but smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said to Charlie calmly, "Do you like my shadow? I can lend it to you to play with for a while. However, there is a price to pay for playing with my shadow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Osborne suddenly attacked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He poured his energy into the pistol and pulled the trigger at Charlie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Energy bullets were shot out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Evelynn thought about it and decided not to use her Stretch Soft Force to defend Charlie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie looked at Osborne, who had actually separated from his shadow. No matter how Charlie controlled Osborne's shadow, Osborne was no longer affected. Charlie was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the first time he had encountered such a situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Osborne shooting at him, Charlie suddenly became serious and did not dare to be careless at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body suddenly began to swell and instantly turned into a ten-foot-tall giant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy bullets hit Charlie's body and exploded instantly, but they did not penetrate his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Charlie still felt uncomfortable, and the severe pain made his face look a little hideous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Does he possess two powers? He can control shadows and shift his shape? Can he strengthen his body? His strengthened body is even stronger than that of an ordinary Class A martial master."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne became serious, thinking, "No wonder Charlie is so arrogant. He is about the same age as Alexander, but he broke through to Class A earlier than Alexander and possessed two powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He is definitely a tough opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Charlie cannot save Alexander just by these two powers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, "I want to see how many bullets your body can withstand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne continued to pull the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Energy bullets kept exploding on Charlie's body. They could not penetrate his body, but every bullet fired by Osborne eventually landed in the same position on Charlie's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it couldn't penetrate him once, try ten times or twenty times!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how Charlie dodged, Osborne's bullets would eventually hit his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The severe pain made Charlie roar towards the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His chest quickly became red and swollen. He was hit by energy bullets and was almost unable to bear it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn bastard, I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie was utterly furious. He hadn't expected Osborne's marksmanship to be so terrible. He simply gave up dodging and rushed towards Osborne frantically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he rushed to Osborne, raised his huge fist high, and smashed towards Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Osborne did not dodge and even showed a look of contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are just a shape-shifting metahuman. How dare you compete with me in strength?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're courting death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne also punched out, colliding with Charlie's huge fist, making a deafening sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, Charlie let out a scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His huge body flew back and slammed heavily in front of Alexander, creating a big hole in the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he got up quickly and did not suffer any severe injuries, there was fear in his eyes when he looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a scene shocked everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was Charlie no match for Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you try to save Alexander with your little strength? Stupid!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised the pistol again and aimed at Alexander's head, saying calmly, "Now, I'm going to kill him. Is there anyone who wants to stop me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was quiet all around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes were filled with fear, and he looked at Evelynn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Evelynn just stared at Osborne, frowning tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly and finally pulled the trigger. The energy bullet flew towards Alexander's head at a high speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was about to be shot to death by Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a ball of rotating energy appeared in front of Alexander, blocking the energy bullet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne turned to look at Evelynn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You finally can't help taking action."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn walked out slowly, with a proud look on her face, and said calmly, "You want to kill him. I have no objection. But I want her staff!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pointed at the Fate Staff in Clarissa's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just give me that staff, and I'll leave right away. I won't care even if you kill everyone here."</span></p></div>
