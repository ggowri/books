        <h1>Chapter 129 Barlyn's Resignation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly after, Clarissa and Donna finished breakfast and walked out of the dining room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why is Barlyn still not up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna asked, frowning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt Donna, Barlyn was busy yesterday and just went to sleep. I also noticed he was in a bad mood. I asked him, but he wouldn't say. Let him sleep a bit longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All he knows is sleep."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna said angrily, "He's your bodyguard captain now. Does he still think he's a young master? If he can't handle a bit of hardship, what's he good for?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go wake that brat up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna instructed a female member of the Personal Guards to go upstairs and wake Barlyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa said helplessly, "Aunt Donna, I've always said there's no need for Barlyn to be my bodyguard captain. Has he ever endured such hardship? You know he seems unreliable, but he's very responsible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as there's any disturbance around me, he gets very nervous. It makes me feel uneasy and guilty towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think we should select a new bodyguard captain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna fell silent at these words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's talk about it when we have a suitable candidate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa frowned and said, "Aunt Donna, isn't there already a suitable candidate?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Clarissa glanced in Osborne's direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pretended not to hear, but he was thrilled inside. Clarissa really acknowledged him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His only obstacle was Donna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna frowned, knowing Clarissa was talking about Osborne. She hesitated for a long time and finally shook her head. "Let's wait a while longer. Let Barlyn keep the position. How will he grow without experiencing hardship? All he does is drink all day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sighed upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna could wait a while longer to test him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't have time to wait!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Barlyn yawned as he came downstairs and complained, "Mom, why did you wake me up so early? I just went to sleep. Can't I live?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna glared at him. "Clarissa is awake, and you're still sleeping? Is this how you perform as bodyguard captain? Do you believe I'll cut off your allowance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, Barlyn would have behaved obediently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without an allowance, he couldn't buy alcohol, which would make him miserable. Facing Donna's threat, he would have obediently begged for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he wasn't short of money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yesterday, Osborne took him to make a lot of money. It was enough for him to live well for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He laughed and said, "Mom, whatever you say. I'm going to drink with Osborne. You guys have fun!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Barlyn prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna was furious. She had just woken Barlyn up and now he was going to drink?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he was with Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew he couldn't stay silent. He walked out from the corner and lightly coughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Captain Barlyn, I'm here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn smiled and said, "Osborne, why call me Captain Barlyn? You're embarrassing me. If it weren't for my mom, I wouldn't bother being this bodyguard captain. Just call me Barlyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it's too much trouble, I'll let you be the captain instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'd be a much better captain than me with your skills!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he spoke, Osborne's heart started pounding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't show it on his face and smiled, saying, "You just don't want to miss out on drinking. If I become the captain, you'd leave all the hard work to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn looked bitter, suddenly remembering yesterday.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glacium Beauty!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Systin!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those two bottles of top wine. Because he was the captain, he didn't get a sip. They were completely wasted by Osborne and Austin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, his heart ached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He whispered, "Osborne, does your friend still have Glacium Beauty? Any more Systin? I haven't tasted them yet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly and said, "There are some, but not many. Besides, you're so busy. I'm afraid if I invite you to drink, you'll get delayed again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn's eyes lit up upon hearing there were still some left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Osborne's concern about him getting delayed again made him a bit anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If what happened yesterday happened again, he'd be devastated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn bit his lip and he became more determined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! I need to resign!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I can't be this bodyguard captain anymore. Now that I have money, I don't need to fear my mom's threats. Anyone would be better at this job than me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne is the best choice!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne becomes the captain, I'll have someone call him away next time we drink. Wouldn't that mean more for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Barlyn got excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted, "Mom, I've decided! I'm resigning!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I recommend Osborne to replace me as the new bodyguard captain! He's stronger and more responsible than me. He's saved Clarissa several times, proving he's more suitable for the job than I am!"</span></p></div>
