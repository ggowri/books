        <h1>Chapter 1408 Our Last Hope</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry nodded, then shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for the West Zone of Celestara, I can't say for sure. It's mostly what I've heard, but it's likely still under the control of the human resistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've heard that the Ninth Dark Deity Legion has sent reinforcements to the West Zone twice, trying to push back against the resistance there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But both times, they failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, it stands to reason that the West Zone is still holding strong. For us human cultivators, it's our last hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Lord Malevolence's Dark Deity Legion breaks through and takes the West Zone, we might as well kiss our freedom goodbye. We'd be nothing more than slaves to him, and hope would vanish entirely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice hardened as he added, "I really wish I could get to the West Zone and join the resistance. The other groups out there? They're just small fry. The West Zone is where the real fight is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A glimmer of hope shone in Harry's eyes, while Osborne looked on in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The West Zone of Celestara..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne recalled Eddie from the Prophet Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he left Blue Planet for Celestara, Eddie had relayed a message from the Grand Elder of the Prophet Alliance, warning him not to venture into the west within a year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, he would face dire consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the time, Osborne had brushed it off, thinking Celestara was vast enough that avoiding the west wouldn't matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now he realized that the west was controlled by human resistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What exactly did the Grand Elder foresee? Why the warning against going to the west?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leaders of the resistance must be the God of Light and the God of Night, the two Deity King warriors still alive. And Isa, being a disciple of the God of Night, is she in the West Zone right now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Should I go there to find her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without the Grand Elder's warning, his next move would likely have been to escape and head straight for the West Zone to join forces with the resistance and reunite with Isa and Clarissa to fight against Lord Malevolence's Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Grand Elder also warned me to watch out for Ophelia, and I nearly paid the price for ignoring that advice&mdash;almost lost myself in the depths of space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I can't dismiss the Grand Elder's words; they carry weight. It's probably best to steer clear of the West Zone for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if I don't go to the West Zone, where can I go? Stay in the East Zone? That's Lord Malevolence's territory, and humans here are at the absolute bottom. Even if there are resistance groups, they're small and easily crushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joining such a group offers no future!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne's frown deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What should I do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I need more information! Harry and Amelia know too little, and most of it is just hearsay. Trying to survive and establish myself in Celestara with this scant info is going to be a tall order!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looks like I need to find better sources of information."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An idea began to form in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill someone! Steal their memories!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've taken out Patrick, so the Ninth Dark Deity Legion will surely come after me. And they'll send a real member of the Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I can eliminate one of them, I can extract their memories and gain vital information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then I can figure out how to survive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne felt a surge of anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne eagerly anticipated the arrival of the Ninth Dark Deity Legion, though he hoped their forces wouldn't be too formidable. He had only recently recovered to the Intermediate Deity level, and his space elemental essence hadn't returned yet. Osborne could handle Superior Deities, but confronting a Transcendent Deity warrior would be troublesome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his confidence, Osborne wasn't completely sure of his odds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pondered for a moment before saying, "You two stay here and train. I'll go scout ahead. If anyone is coming, I can alert us in advance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia nodded, concern etched on their faces. "Be careful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry," Osborne assured with a smile before swiftly heading back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once out of sight from Harry and Amelia, Osborne used his earth elemental power to merge his body with the rock, activating Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Ninth Dark Deity Legion uses Spirit Tracers, so they'll likely follow this mine tunnel. I just need to keep an eye on the entrance, and I'll soon find out who's coming after us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they're within my capacity, I'll take them out directly," he thought, settling in to wait.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Half a day later, Osborne's eyes lit up. The prey had finally arrived.</span></p></div>
