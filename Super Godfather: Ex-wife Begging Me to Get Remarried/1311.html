        <h1>Chapter 1310 Terrence's Shock</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Terrence, puzzled yet amused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really want to see my Divine Flame? Honestly, it might be better for you if you didn't. Just facing the end like this could be a mercy for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence frowned, confusion etched on his features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's smile grew wider. "Because just dying now would spare you some hurt feelings. If I show you my Divine Flame and beat you, I fear you might not take it well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence scoffed, saying, "Not take it well? What a joke! I'm Terrence! I've lived for over a thousand years&mdash;I've seen it all! Show me your Divine Flame already!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged. "Well, if that's how you feel, then alright! Watch closely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Divine Shadow and God of Star exchanged amused glances behind Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A knot of unease twisted in Terrence's gut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne then gathered his power, dispelling the Eclipsing Mantra, revealing two transparent flames hovering atop his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence froze, disbelief flooding his mind. He rubbed his eyes vigorously, convinced he was hallucinating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how many times he blinked, those two transparent Divine Flames stayed locked in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two Divine Flames?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An Intermediate Deity?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got to be kidding me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're telling me you're just an Intermediate Deity? A Waste Divine Body? Are you mocking me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence's voice cracked, incredulity washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could never have imagined that Osborne was merely an Intermediate Deity with a Waste Divine Body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is impossible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The color drained from Terrence's face as he grasped the implications of everything Osborne had said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had Osborne remained on par with the Deschanel Clan's Transcendent Deities? That was acceptable&mdash;if they were a similar rank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to lose to someone significantly beneath him? The very thought made him feel ill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence nearly choked on his own shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most damning was the fact that he had witnessed Osborne hold his ground against the Transcendent Deity warrior of his clan, proving more than a match with skills that had caused them plenty of headaches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence had genuinely thought Osborne was a Transcendent Deity himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence's voice quivered with shock. "How can this be happening?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're an Intermediate Deity&mdash;specifically, an Intermediate Deity with a Waste Divine Body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could you ever stand up to the likes of my Transcendent Deity warriors? This makes no sense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne simply smiled, saying, "Why not? I'm standing right here, aren't I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way!" Terrence was nearly trembling. "Not even in the Age of Gods could an Intermediate Deity confront a Transcendent Deity directly, let alone defeat one!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even the most legendary Deity Kings, when at their Intermediate Deity stage, might take on Superior Deities, but never would they dare challenge Transcendent Deities!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The gap between them is wider than the ocean! There's no way an Intermediate Deity could ever beat a Transcendent Deity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could your talent possibly be stronger than that of a Deity King? It's inconceivable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence was losing his composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled. "Wait, so I'm that amazing? You're saying even the Deity Kings at the Intermediate Deity stage couldn't handle Transcendent Deities? I appreciate you sharing that; it boosts my confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But yes, I am indeed an Intermediate Deity! As for my Divine Body, it's not actually a Waste Divine Body&mdash;it's just transparent due to some special circumstances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In reality, my Divine Body might be around Level Seven. Perhaps even stronger..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence was left utterly speechless, staring blankly at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was Terrence stunned, but even Divine Shadow and God of Star behind Osborne were momentarily frozen in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stared at Osborne in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had sensed the strength of Osborne's Divine Body before, but because his Divine Flame was transparent, they couldn't determine the exact level of his Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, hearing Osborne declare it himself, they realized it was equivalent to a Level Seven Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It might even be stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Exchanging incredulous glances, Divine Shadow and God of Star both gasped, their astonishment palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence, voice rising in disbelief, exclaimed, "Impossible! You're just an Intermediate Deity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could you possess a Level Seven Divine Body? Historically, within the Intermediate Deity ranks, there have only been a handful of cases where someone even reached Level Six! And those individuals were exceedingly rare, ultimately rising to Deity King status!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They were all the elites of the Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could you possibly have a Level Seven Divine Body while still at Intermediate Deity? This must be a mistake! You're trying to intimidate me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged casually. "If my Divine Body weren't on par with Level Seven, how could I have defeated a Transcendent Deity warrior while still being an Intermediate Deity?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence was immediately at a loss for words as that argument struck a chord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only think, "Right, if Osborne's Divine Body wasn't Level Seven, how could he have triumphed over a Transcendent Deity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, his Divine Body really is comparable to Level Seven... even stronger?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of monster is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a wave of jealousy washed over Terrence. If he had a talent like Osborne's, he would have long since broken through to become a Deity King, reaching the pinnacle of warriors in the Age of Gods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne broke the silence with a grin. "Alright! So, can we kick things off now?"</span></p></div>
