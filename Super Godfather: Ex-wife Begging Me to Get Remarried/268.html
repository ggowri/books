How dare you?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's outburst grabbed everyone's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd stared at her, confused by her intense emotions. They thought, "Did Osborne do something terrible to her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their curiosity was piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley looked grim; he seemed to know what Ophelia was about to do and tried to stop her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ophelia shook him off and stormed toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Ophelia with a calm expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's cool demeanor returned as she gazed at Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, Ophelia looked stunning today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was adorned with jewelry worth over three hundred million dollars, making her the center of attention on any occasion, especially on her wedding day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she was unfortunate to encounter Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa, the top beauty of </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> and the eldest daughter of an ancient family, outshone Ophelia in every aspect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She too was dressed to impress, and the Crown of Fate on her head, a gift from Osborne, made her shine like a newly crowned queen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next to her, Ophelia was just a supporting role.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you are a liar!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia cursed while her body was trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, "Ophelia, how am I a liar? Did I deceive you? You seem to have lost your cool. You should leave before you do something you will regret."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia gritted her teeth, her mind in turmoil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had Osborne ever lied to her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they were together, Osborne had been good to her, always accommodating and silently supporting her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she had seen Osborne as weak and indecisive, so she divorced him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the divorce, Osborne seemed to transform. He boldly returned to the Caldwell Estate, holding Evelyn hostage and facing down armed guards with fake explosives to secure a twenty-million-dollar divorce settlement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From then on, Osborne became someone she did not recognize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He became a VIP at the Draco Group's auctions and spent tens of millions of dollars, outbidding Wesley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that was not all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, Osborne became Clarissa's savior, displaying great strength and becoming her bodyguard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, for some unknown reason, Osborne aligned with Alison, her rival, and at the Ashford family's diamond dealing market, expertly selected uncut diamonds that were worth billions of dollars, crushing the Caldwell Group's jewelry business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Ashford family's diamond mine fell to Luna Jewelry, thanks to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterwards, Osborne also allied with Austin, humiliating Wesley once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, Ophelia barely recognized Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, whom she had deemed worthless, repeatedly outshone her and Wesley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Why did Osborne attract so many remarkable women?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alison, Austin, Clarissa&mdash;each of them was not only as good as me but even better and more beautiful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could not accept it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, seeing Osborne and Clarissa publicly declare their relationship at her wedding with Wesley, Ophelia's psyche shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Crown of Fate was the final straw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt unbalanced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She regretted divorcing Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had believed Osborne was inferior to Wesley in every way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, she doubted that judgment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "If that were true, why would Clarissa choose Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why would Osborne gift Clarissa the priceless Crown of Fate?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had I not divorced him, the Crown of Fate would have been mine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had deceived me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always been capable but hid it until I initiated the divorce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could not stand it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wanted to ruin Osborne's happiness, to ensure no other woman could have him if I could not."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's heart now twisted with hatred; she clenched her teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you are not worthy of Ms. Radcliffe!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have deceived her! You are a divorced man! How can you be with her? You are my ex-husband, the one I discarded! You do not deserve to be with Ms. Radcliffe!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's face contorted in rage as she turned to Clarissa, shouting, "Ms. Radcliffe, Osborne has tricked you! He is not a good man and does not deserve you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He was married to me for three years, and I even carried his child!"</span></p></div>
