        <h1>Chapter 39 Metahuman and Martial Artist</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was in the midst of speaking when he suddenly froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Isa didn&rsquo;t dodge; she casually kicked out with lightning speed, so fast that even with Osborne activating Satan&rsquo;s Eye, he could barely follow the movement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In an instant, Milo was sent flying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His body crumpled, bones almost entirely shattered, lying motionless on the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What did you just say? His strength is great, so I shouldn&rsquo;t do what?&rdquo; Isa clapped her hands, questioning Osborne with a puzzled expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With his eyes widened in shock, Osborne took a sharp breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No wonder when I first saw her, I sensed a threat. Turns out she&rsquo;s this formidable</span><span style="font-style: italic;">,</span> he thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Isa, unfazed, approached, asking, &ldquo;Are you both alright?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne nodded. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re fine.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Isa grinned. &ldquo;Not bad. Facing a Class C psychic metahuman alone and managing to make him flee.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne, surprised, asked, &ldquo;Class C psychic metahuman?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Isa nodded. &ldquo;Metahumans are the chosen ones of this world, classified into various types like psychic, elemental, enhancement, shape-shifting, and more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Metahumans range from Class F to S in strength. A Class C metahuman is already a skilled individual, not something a hundred ordinary people could handle.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was somewhat speechless. &ldquo;A skilled individual? So you took him down with one kick? Are you also a metahuman? What&rsquo;s your class?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Isa shrugged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no metahuman; I&rsquo;m a martial artist. Martial artists are graded from Class F to S, too.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Can martial arts be that powerful?&rdquo; Osborne was astonished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Isa rolled her eyes at him. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t martial arts be that powerful? We martial artists have no lesser potential than metahumans. Despite being a natural-born metahuman, you can&rsquo;t underestimate martial arts, or you&rsquo;ll regret it. You&rsquo;ll understand all this in due time.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Without dwelling further, Isa lifted Milo&rsquo;s broken body, remarking, &ldquo;I happen to be short on test subjects. He&rsquo;ll do as my test subject. A Class C metahuman, usable at best.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s eyes widened again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Test subject?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What kind of test?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Was Isa truly conducting human research?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne didn&rsquo;t delve further, instead asking, &ldquo;You still haven&rsquo;t told me your class. Class B? Or A?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Isa cryptically smiled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find out in time.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, she walked away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Oh, by the way, I just received news that Clarissa was recently attacked mysteriously. Her bodyguard team suffered significant losses, and she&rsquo;s likely to be replenishing her security team soon.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As Isa disappeared, Osborne&rsquo;s eyes lit up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he called out in her direction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">That information was crucial to him, as it would determine the success or failure of the second test.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Initially, he was unsure how to remain by Clarissa&rsquo;s side, but this news gave him a plan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He would apply to be her bodyguard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If successful, he could stay close to Clarissa and pass the second test of inheritance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No wonder at the auction, Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguards kept everyone at bay, and she swiftly left after purchases. It was due to the attack.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">In two days, I can go to the Radcliffe Manor and have lunch with Clarissa. By then, I can find an opportunity to propose becoming her bodyguard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was confident in applying to be Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, the Godfather&rsquo;s test was bound to be anything but simple; there would likely be unexpected challenges and dangers Osborne hadn&rsquo;t foreseen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Well, at least I&rsquo;ve found an opening</span><span style="font-style: italic;">,</span> Osborne thought, determined to continue honing The Breath of Celestial.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was only because of his recent advancements in The Breath of Celestial that his physical prowess had grown immensely. Just days ago, he wouldn&rsquo;t have stood a chance against Milo.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Breath of Celestial rapidly enhanced his physical attributes. The foundation of a martial artist&rsquo;s strength lay in power, speed, reflexes, and agility.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With continued practice, Osborne could keep getting stronger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But when he thought of Milo, Osborne&rsquo;s expression turned cold. Who would hire a metahuman assassin to kill him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It couldn&rsquo;t be Wesley or Ophelia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They still needed him to get to Clarissa. Even if Wesley wanted him dead, he wouldn&rsquo;t act until after meeting Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">That left only Justin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne snorted derisively. At the Draco Auction House, he had publicly humiliated Justin using his VIP status. Knowing Justin as he did, Osborne was certain of a fierce retaliation from Justin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Justin, if you want to play games, then I&rsquo;ll play along.&rdquo;</p></div>
