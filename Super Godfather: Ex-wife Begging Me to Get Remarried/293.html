        <h1>Chapter 293 Reaching an Agreement</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Osborne finished speaking, Clarissa froze, her brow furrowing as she turned to him in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne squeezed her hand tightly, giving her a meaningful look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa bit her lip, unsure of why Osborne was making such a bold move, but she chose not to question him further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa trusted that Osborne would never abandon her; he had promised to share the burden and face challenges together. He wouldn't give up now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Osborne suggested she leave for a while, she knew he had his reasons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan, however, was not so easily swayed. His brow was furrowed in deep thought as he scrutinized Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wondered, "What's his game? Is he really planning to head to Dampston and face off against Alexander?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What gives him the confidence to even think he can pull that off?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dampston is the Paltrow family's territory. Going there to challenge Alexander? That's just asking for trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shot Osborne a cold glare. "Are you kidding me? Do you even realize what you're getting into? If you dare step foot in Dampston, you'll be in for a world of hurt!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied coolly, "Don't worry about me, Mr. Dylan Radcliffe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I die, then you won't have to worry anymore. All I need is a promise from you. If I win this fair competition against Alexander and the Paltrow family agrees to let go of Clarissa, I want you to marry her to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you agree to that, I'll convince Clarissa to leave with you right now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If not, then I'll stand my ground with Clarissa, no matter what!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan's expression shifted between uncertainty and contemplation as he exchanged glances with York and Abraham. They all seemed to agree that they could meet Osborne's demands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, in their eyes, there was no way Osborne could compete with Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Paltrow family would never back down just because of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To them, it was a no-brainer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they agreed to Osborne's terms, they could take Clarissa away and control her freedom. They could even whisk her off to Dampston, ensuring she wouldn't see Osborne again before her wedding to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the ceremony was over, everything would be settled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They believed that once Clarissa experienced Alexander's worth, she would quickly forget about Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After weighing their options, Dylan nodded decisively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll take you up on that. As the head of the Radcliffe family, I promise you that if you can win against Alexander and the Paltrow family agrees to let Clarissa go, then I, Dylan, will ensure she becomes your wife."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up. "Great!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He extended his hand, and they clasped palms in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tension that had filled the air dissipated, and York and Abraham slipped back into the shadows, no longer lingering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Dylan Radcliffe, please give me a moment alone with Clarissa. I need to persuade her to leave with you. You know how stubborn she can be; if you're here, I won't stand a chance at convincing her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's tone was calm but firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan cast a wary glance at Osborne but ultimately nodded. "Fine! But I'm warning you. Don't pull any tricks on me. I won't go easy on you! I'll be right outside, so make it quick."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Dylan turned and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna and Barlyn hesitated for a moment before following suit, leaving Osborne and Clarissa alone in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the door closed, Clarissa rushed into Osborne's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I don't want to leave! I want to stay with you! You promised we'd face everything together!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice trembled with a hint of vulnerability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne held her close, gently patting her back as he said, "Clarissa, I don't want to be apart either. I wish I could be with you every single second. But you know how things </span><span>are right now. If I don't take this chance, your father and the elders of the Radcliffe family will be ready to end me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not afraid of dying; I just have other plans. When I say I'm going to Dampston to compete against Alexander fairly, I mean it. I'm not just putting on a show for your father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our separation is only temporary. I will come for you, I promise! You belong to me, and no one can take you away from me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I swear it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa could feel a rush of emotions surge within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reluctantly, she managed a nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I believe you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you have to come for me quickly! If you don't show up, I... I'll end it myself at the wedding with Alexander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a wave of panic wash over him at the thought of losing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tightened his embrace, burying his face in her hair. "Don't say that, you silly girl! It won't come to that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he reached into his Dimensional Space and pulled out a glimmering blood diamond, its deep red hue captivating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, take this. I've heard it can significantly boost power levels. You're currently Class B+, and with this, you might just break through to Class A master!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can make that leap to Class A master, no one will be able to threaten you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaned closer, his tone dropping to a serious whisper. "But you must promise me, don't let anyone know where this blood diamond came from!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa stared at the blood diamond in disbelief. "Osborne, this is..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is something I found in the diamond mines. You can't tell a soul. If anyone finds out, I could be in serious trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A shiver ran down Clarissa's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes glistened with tears as the weight of Osborne's sacrifice hit her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa thought to herself, "How much does he trust me to give me this treasure?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overwhelmed by emotion, her heart swelled with affection as she threw her arms around his neck, pulling him in for a passionate kiss.</span></p></div>
