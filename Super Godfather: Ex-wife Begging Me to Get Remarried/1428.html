        <h1>Chapter 1427 Rapid Recovery</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle erupted with ferocity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Jeffrey and the members of the Wild Flame Army, fighting the Deathborn was second nature; they had faced these creatures countless times over the years. Each soldier was seasoned and knew exactly how to engage the Deathborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the overwhelming odds&mdash;with more than ten Transcendent Deity Deathborns among their ranks, nearly double their number&mdash;Jeffrey's group's thorough preparation kept them from faltering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deathborn, with their low intelligence, struggled in the chaos of the fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their lack of coordination became a glaring weakness; they charged mindlessly, attacking without strategy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast, Jeffrey and his team worked together seamlessly. Although they couldn't match the prowess of Osborne's Blood Demon members, they were still far superior to the Deathborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, Jeffrey and the ten squad leaders had their Malevolence Amulets, a vital lifeline in this deadly skirmish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the intensity of the battle, they steadily whittled down the Deathborn numbers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, none of them noticed that Osborne was playing it safe, holding back his full strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His attacks appeared powerful, but he was merely creating a distraction, allowing the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to absorb the surrounding high-grade death scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to Osborne's cover and the Eclipsing Mantra, no one sensed anything amiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Deathborn continued to fall, the high-grade death scent accumulated, and Osborne felt the healing energy coursing through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His injuries began to mend, and his strength grew, all while remaining undetected by Jeffrey and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fight raged on, and casualties began to mount.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's squad members had been transformed into Blood Clan warriors, appearing the same on the surface but now only obeying his commands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wouldn't let them risk their lives unnecessarily; whenever danger loomed, he stepped in to shield them from the Deathborn's attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, Osborne realized he couldn't afford to hold back any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deathborn numbers were swelling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their efforts in battle, they had already taken down over fifty Deathborn, yet the enemy's ranks were still growing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they faced more than two hundred Deathborns, including twelve Transcendent Deity ones, with the rest being Superior Deity Deathborns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Jeffrey shouted, his voice filled with rage as he watched one of his team members get torn apart, flesh and blood devoured in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are way more Deathborn here than we expected! This is a mining area; how can so many still be lurking around after countless clean-ups?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His divine power surged, a fierce aura radiating from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the pinnacle of the Transcendent Deity realm, he was a powerhouse, but that also made him a target for five Transcendent Deity Deathborns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite facing such overwhelming odds, he held his ground, his divine power cutting through the air like a blade, forcing the Deathborn back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But killing them? That was another story entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation for the others was even bleaker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey knew they couldn't keep this up; if they didn't turn the tide soon, their entire squad could be wiped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deathborn didn't play nice, and their relentless, reckless nature made them incredibly tough foes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey shouted, urgency lacing his voice as he surveyed the battlefield, "Fall back! It's too open here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Deathborn outnumber us. If we stay, we'll get overwhelmed! We need to retreat into a narrow cave where they can't swarm us. That's our ticket to victory!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, his team sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were plenty of caves nearby, and Jeffrey led them into one of the larger ones, his squad moving quickly to follow. Osborne and his team rushed in right behind him, needing to regroup as the chaos unfolded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tide of Deathborn had gone wild, charging into the cave without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the confined space restricted their numbers; they couldn't all push in at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, Jeffrey felt a wave of relief wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Form up in squads and hold the line against these Deathborn! We'll grind them down!" he ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the dust settled, the battle shifted. Inside the narrow cave, only five Deathborns could attack at a time. Each squad had more than enough strength to fend them off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If any Transcendent Deity Deathborn joined the fray, Jeffrey and his fellow Transcendent Deities were ready to jump in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What unfolded was a war of attrition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Deathborn had just a bit more cunning, they might have recognized the danger and tactically retreated or sought another way to regroup. But with their low intelligence, they were hell-bent on taking down their foes, driven entirely by instinct.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, the Deathborn fell, their ranks dwindling rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rich, high-grade death scent lingered in the cave, undetected by the exhausted warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity silently soaked it all up, entering a rapid recovery phase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was also healing swiftly. The energy flowed through him like a rush, and he could feel the ember of his third Divine Flame reigniting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was nearly there, on the verge of reaching the Superior Deity realm once again!</span></p></div>
