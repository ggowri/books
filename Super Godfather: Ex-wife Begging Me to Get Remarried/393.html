        <h1>Chapter 393 His Confidence</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was surprised. Isa, who had just helped him analyze the dangerous situation, actually refused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it because it was so dangerous this time that she was scared?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she clearly wasn't. Despite not knowing why, Osborne sensed that she didn't particularly care about the Aberrants, much like her attitude towards the Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't have declined to help him out of fear of danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned and gazed at Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She explained calmly, "I can't help you this time because I believe that with your current strength, you can no longer rely on others! If you consistently seek assistance whenever uncertain, you'll never become truly self-reliant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not everyone will be there to assist you every time! As your strength and status increase, fewer people will be capable of aiding you. Ultimately, the only one you can depend on is yourself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is both an opportunity and a test for you. If I assist you or even accompany you for protection, you might be dependent on me, and you will feel assured that even if you can't do it, there's someone to back you up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In this way, I'm not helping you but impeding your growth. Therefore, this time, despite facing the Aberrants and various powerful forces aligned with them, the only person you can depend on is yourself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have to get used to being someone else's support rather than relying on others!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Isa finished speaking, Osborne fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that she was right, but the Maritime Auction was really important, involving his succession test and the fate of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems that you haven't figured it out yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa sighed, "This is not your fault. After all, considering how quickly you've grown, in less than two months, you've made remarkable progress. You have already done very well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But that's not enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A truly strong man must possess corresponding physical strength, mindset, and, most importantly, confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're already a Class A martial master, yet your mindset as a strong man isn't even on par with that of a Class B one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's face turned cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne trembled. "Is my mindset as a strong man not even on par with that of a Class B one?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clenched his fists, and his gaze became solemn and firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, I know what to do! Thank you for reminding me. I really don't have the mindset of a strong man right now, but I will work hard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and became much calmer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He ceased dwelling on the dangers and challenges ahead, recognizing that regardless of his thoughts, he had to confront and resolve them himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strong never asked for help!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, now that I'm a Class A martial master, shouldn't you teach me some advanced force techniques, such as Spiral Force, Deadly Force, Ninefold Tide Crash, and Rock Force? I can't wait to learn them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa couldn't help laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She noticed that Osborne's mindset had changed, which was precisely what she needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nodded and said, "Even if you don't demand this, I will teach you! You are already a Class A martial master. It will embarrass me that you don't master any advanced force techniques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, I will teach you Spiral Force first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, Isa finally revealed the entire secret of Spiral Force to him. He had expected it to be complex and challenging, but he quickly found that it was surprisingly straightforward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was difficult was the way of thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within just one hour, Osborne had already mastered Spiral Force. When he unleashed it, Spiral Force exhibited greater penetrating power compared to regular force, effortlessly breaching the enemy's defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While his Spiral Force wasn't as powerful as Isa's, he firmly believed he could match Brad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In another fight with Brad, I'm confident I could knock his head off with just one punch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's confidence was boosted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spiral Force is merely the most fundamental advanced force technique. Plenty of Class A martial masters will eventually grasp it on their own, even without formal instruction. There's nothing to be proud of, though you've mastered it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When you come back, I will teach you more advanced force techniques."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Isa waved her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can leave. I'm going to sleep. Without enough sleep, girls will age quickly! I haven't been in love yet, and I don't want to become an elderly woman soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rolled her eyes at Osborne and drove him out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staring at the closed door, he was helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just mentioned once that having never been in love, you couldn't understand how it feels. Yet, you remember it! Women are really vindictive," Osborne muttered while making his way back to the Augustine Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, Isaac is waiting for you in the meeting room. I heard that the Paltrow family sent an ancient magic weapon. He wants you to take a look," Nathan said excitedly after seeing Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately grew overjoyed, thinking, "Did they finally deliver the ancient magic weapon? According to the bet between me and Alexander, it should be at least level three!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How powerful will an ancient magic weapon at level three be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it can significantly enhance my strength and help the Maritime Auction go more smoothly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hurried towards the meeting room.</span></p></div>
