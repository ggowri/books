        <h1>Chapter 327 A Bit Abnormal</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I want to go with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan was the first to speak. "It's still unclear what the pirate's lair is like. Thus, it's too dangerous for you to go alone. I can't let you take the risk alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan also stood up. "I'll go too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although my power doesn't have a very strong attack power, if there is a really strong opponent, I can at least temporarily affect the opponent's actions and make it easier for us to escape."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa also said anxiously, "Osborne, I'll go, too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't take me, I'll secretly follow you myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why were they threatening me as they are discussing it? Women's thought is really different."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about it, he did not refuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them had no knowledge of the pirate's lair, but Osborne, through the perspective of the combat drones, could get an advanced understanding of the situation. If it was too dangerous, they could simply retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This operation probably didn't involve too much danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, let's go together, but you all have to obey my orders."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them became excited and ran to the stern, ready to release the lifeboat carried by Alisa Ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne waved his hand to stop them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need to complicate things! We're all metahumans, so we can just fly over there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished speaking, the three of them were stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, we can all fly, but flying consumes a lot of energy. I'm afraid we will be exhausted before we reach the pirates' lair."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan touched the back of his head embarrassedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan and Yulissa also nodded in agreement. Many </span><span>Class</span><span> C metahumans were already able to fly. With the strength of the three of them, it would naturally not be difficult to fly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But,</span><span> it was only a short flight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless someone possessed a unique power specifically suited for flying, no one would easily choose to fly for long distances. Firstly, there was the concern of being seen by ordinary people, and secondly, it was also about conserving energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, and I'll take you flying."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saying that, Osborne moved his mind and immediately attracted the power of the strong wind in the void, which raised a gust of wind around the three people and rolled up their bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wind elemental power was one of the most suitable powers for flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not only fast, but also extremely labor-saving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne waved his hand, and a strong gust of wind carried the four of them towards the direction where the pirate leader had escaped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you are actually a metahuman of wind elemental power?" Yulissa asked in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not because the wind elemental power was so rare, but because the wind element power was too common and did not fit the image of Osborne in her mind at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt that the powers he possessed must be incredibly mysterious and powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, was it just the most common wind elemental power?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! That's not right!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan furrowed his brows and said, "Mr. Augustine, it's highly unlikely that you are just a metahuman with wind elemental power. The abilities you displayed earlier were definitely beyond what the wind elemental power can achieve! So, Mr. Augustine, are you a dual-power holder? Not only that, but you also practice martial arts, making you a formidable martial artist, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned, then nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I probably be considered to have dual powers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saying that, he touched his nose awkwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't have two powers. His powers had grown so extensive that even he himself couldn't fully grasp them at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These powers included super vision, anticipate danger, X-ray vision, mind control, earth elemental power, water elemental power, fire elemental power, wind elemental </span><span>power, lightning elemental power, spatial power, Devil's Light after fusion, and psychic power - Illusion Projection that he had never used on another person before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through a quick calculation of the abilities he could use, Osborne was somewhat shocked by the results. Even he himself felt that he had become somewhat abnormal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had more than a dozen powers!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this world, only a small number of people could unlock powers, and every metahuman with powers could be considered a person blessed by deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Osborne had met many metahumans during this period, it was actually only because he was at a high enough level that he had been able to meet them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To ordinary people, metahumans were like deity high above. They were extremely rare and most people had never even heard of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the rare metahumans, more than 95% had only activated one power, such as Donna and her son, Nathan and Ryan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If one possessed two powers, he would be considered a super genius. Even in ancient families, not every generation had such a super genius.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they appeared, they would be immediately valued, well trained, and treated as the pillars of the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If someone possessed three different powers, then they could only be described as a prodigy among prodigies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a prodigy was extremely rare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For example, Clarissa possessed three powers - discern lies, divine healing, and Divine and Demonic Wings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who possessed three or more powers were considered absolute anomalies, rare and exceptional beings. They may not appear once in dozens or hundreds of years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But, Osborne had more than a dozen powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it wouldn't be appropriate to say that he possessed over a dozen powers because he actually only had one true power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the Satan's Eye!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was mutated Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of his powers were obtained by the mutating Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From this point of view, the Satan's Eye was indeed perverted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard that the Augustine family in Newport City has more than a hundred people who have activated the power of the Satan's Eye. I really don't know how terrifying the Augustine family in Newport City is!" Osborne thought to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, his expression suddenly changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The combat drone stopped moving at this time and hovered high in the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was surprised. "It seems that we have found the pirates' lair!"</span></p></div>
