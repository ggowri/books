        <h1>Chapter 1082 Heavy Injury to Gerardo</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flash of interdimensional travel, Gerardo executed his Bull Charge at a speed so blindingly fast that Osborne barely had time to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact sent him hurtling through the air, but as Gerardo came to a halt, his expression was anything but triumphant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the hit, he knew Osborne had only sustained minor injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strength of Osborne's martial art aura had far exceeded Gerardo's expectations. Although his horns had breached the aura, they had done so with little force&mdash;over seventy percent of his power had been neutralized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining thirty percent had barely broken the skin, leaving Osborne with nothing more than a superficial wound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, Osborne was hardly hurt at all. For him, this was just a scratch, and he would be back on his feet in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo cursed inwardly, "Damn it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of monster is this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've fused two divine remains! Even top-tier Class S warriors fall before me, yet here I am, struggling against him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had known it would come to this, he would never have thrown Osborne into that Human Slave cultivation vessel. He would never have given Osborne the best Human Slave cultivation solution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those top-notch liquids didn't just boost Osborne's physical strength over twenty-fold; the divine blood infused within granted him unimaginable abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For instance, the blood of Goddess Medusa vastly enhanced Osborne's recovery abilities and allowed him to ignore petrification.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Minotaur's blood fortified his skin and flesh, giving him resilience that was almost on par with Gerardo's own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Wolf God's blood made Osborne more agile and faster, while the Vampire God's blood widened and strengthened his veins, enabling explosive power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the Titan God's blood had amplified his sheer strength to terrifying levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, Gerardo was filled with regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't been so greedy to turn Osborne into a Human Slave, even if Osborne had broken through to Class S, Osborne wouldn't be nearly as formidable as he was now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo had unwittingly transformed an already powerful being into a true monster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but laugh, a sound laced with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this all you've got, Gerardo? This attack barely tickles! I guess I overestimated you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In reality, it wasn't that Osborne had overestimated Gerardo; he had simply underestimated himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until now, he hadn't realized the extent of his own defenses. After breaking through to Class S, he hadn't had the chance to test his limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, facing Gerardo's Bull Charge and only sustaining minor damage, Osborne felt a surge of confidence, his expression turning icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gerardo, if this is your best, then it's my turn to attack! Like I said before, only one of us is walking out of here alive today!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And from where I'm standing, it looks like that person is going to be me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's face darkened, his teeth grinding in anger. "You're too arrogant, Osborne! Even your grandfather, Sebastian, couldn't take me down. You think you can? You're dreaming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, "You'll find out soon enough whether it's a dream or not!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne launched himself forward, his speed becoming a terrifying blur as he closed the distance between them in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo stood his ground, unflinching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the power of the Minotaur coursing through him, he had unwavering confidence in his defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed Osborne was strong, but when it came to defense, Gerardo felt he still had the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way Osborne could break through his defenses and truly hurt him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of dodging, Gerardo unleashed a powerful kick toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bull Kick!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne narrowed his eyes, showing no sign of retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted, "Going toe-to-toe? Bring it on!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deadly Force! Explosive Force!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His assault landed squarely on Gerardo, the sheer might of it piercing through Gerardo's robust skin defense and drilling deep into his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then it exploded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Gerardo's defensive capabilities, thanks to absorbing the Minotaur's essence, were formidable, they were merely surface deep&mdash;his internal organs remained vulnerable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Explosive Force detonated within him, causing Gerardo to let out a blood-curdling scream as he spewed forth a fountain of crimson mixed with the remnants of his shattered insides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Gerardo's Bull Kick connected with Osborne. However, the impact was significantly weakened due to his injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood his ground, bolstered by his martial art aura, absorbing the blow without budging an inch. He retaliated with a kick of his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he drew upon the power of his right leg's Divine Bone and unleashed the Breath of Celestial!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, this was Osborne's all-out attack, pushing his strength to its very limits. Channeling the technique of Deadly Force, he struck deep into Gerardo's core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then the strike burst forth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A horrific explosion erupted, tearing through Gerardo's side. Flesh and blood scattered in every direction as the sheer raw power of Osborne's attack obliterated his body.</span></p></div>
