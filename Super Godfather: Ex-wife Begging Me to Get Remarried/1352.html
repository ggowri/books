        <h1>Chapter 1351 Press</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Transcendent Deity warrior spoke up, "Godfather, I assure you, all the warriors from the Hastings family are here. No one is hiding in the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know how the Hastings family offended you, but if they've done something wrong, I'll apologize on their behalf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, you can deal with them as you see fit; we won't protect any of them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finished with a look of righteous determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shot him a scornful glance, his expression dripping with derision. The warrior felt a twinge of embarrassment but quickly regained his composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all understood that Osborne's power was beyond their reach. If sacrificing nearly a hundred members of the Hastings family could quell his fury and save their own skins, they wouldn't hesitate to throw them under the bus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right! Those scoundrels from the Hastings family dared to cross Godfather; they deserve whatever's coming to them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather, you can punish them however you want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hastings, get down and beg for mercy! Do you want to drag us all down with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those Hastings fools..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted in blame, eager to distance themselves from the Hastings family, hoping Osborne would focus all his wrath on them alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne merely sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Pantheon League was made up of thirty-six Divine Families, and when they were thriving, they stood united, sharing both fortune and glory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when trouble struck, especially in the face of life-or-death crises, their true colors emerged. They would gladly step on each other to ensure their own survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the crowd was united in their desire for the Hastings family to perish, believing it would appease Osborne's anger and grant them a reprieve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nearly hundred members of the Hastings family stood pale and terrified, trembling under the weight of accusations and scorn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wanted to shout back, to curse the ones who had offended Osborne, but they </span><span>simply didn't know what exactly Osborne was here for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All they could do was watch Osborne warily, waiting for his verdict as if standing before a judge. Anxiety hung thick in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!" Osborne let out a cold snort, uninterested in the internal strife of the Pantheon League.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His focus was singular: to find the ones who had tormented his parents and uncover the truth of their fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he dismissed the crowd with a wave of his hand, silence descended once more, and no one dared to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Osborne broke the tension. "Twenty-five years ago, the leader of the Hastings family, Reginald, ventured alone to </span><span>Rosmandi's</span><span> </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> to investigate the Crystal of Life reserves in a rare metal mine for the Pantheon League.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"On his way back, he encountered Theodore, the son of Sebastian, the Godfather of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>, along with his wife, Vivienne. Reginald abducted them and brought them back to the Hastings family, locking them in the dungeons."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's voice dripped with malice as he fixed his gaze on the Hastings family members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, anyone from the Hastings family who knows about this, step forward! Don't even think about hiding the truth from me; I know more than you can imagine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His icy words sent a ripple of panic through the Hastings family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of them exchanged glances, confusion evident in some, while others were gripped by fear and anxiety, realizing Osborne's intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their bodies began to tremble as the weight of the moment bore down on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few Intermediate Deities from the Hastings family breathed a sigh of relief, knowing this incident didn't involve them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's voice was as cold as ice. "I'm giving you ten seconds to step forward!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If anyone knows anything but remains silent, I'll kill every last one of you and dig the answers out of your memories myself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're involved in this, now's your chance to come clean!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a few Intermediate Deities from the Hastings family spoke up, their voices urgent, "Don't let your mistakes drag the whole family down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is something we can't hide anymore; the Godfather is here. We should cooperate and make this easier on ourselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just step forward," another urged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, trembling with fear, a dozen or so Junior Deities slowly emerged from the crowd of Hastings family members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at them, Osborne compared their appearance to the people Reginald remembered torturing his parents with and found that they were indeed the same individuals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flash of murderous intent flickered in Osborne's eyes, but he kept it in check.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me be clear: Theodore and Vivienne are my parents! I'm searching for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From what I learned from Reginald, my parents managed to escape into a black vortex. But Reginald didn't pursue them; he didn't know where that vortex was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> I ask you: who among you hunted my parents?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who knows the location of that black vortex?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me where it is! If my parents are still alive, I might just spare your lives!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hope sparked in the eyes of the dozen or so who stood before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know where the black vortex is! I can help! I want to make amends for my sins&mdash;I can lead you there!"</span></p></div>
