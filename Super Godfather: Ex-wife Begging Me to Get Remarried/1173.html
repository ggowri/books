        <h1>Chapter 1172 Forge the Divine Bone</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had never intended to forge his Divine Body just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The process was anything but quick; it required an absolutely safe environment where interruptions were the last thing he could afford. One slip, one distraction, and everything could come crashing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The consequences of failure were dire&mdash;his body could shatter, or worse, he could be left in death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Osborne aimed to create wasn't just any Divine Body; he was after something extraordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to Isa, he needed to strive for a Level Seven Solar Divine Body. Only then could he hope to surpass everyone else and achieve an unprecedented Omnipotent Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But achieving a Level Seven Divine Body on the first try was practically impossible. Even during the Age of Gods, the greatest prodigies, equipped with rare resources and the guidance of ancient deities, had never managed to forge a Level Seven Solar Divine Body right out of the gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The instances of anyone successfully creating a Level Six or Level Five Divine Body on their first attempt were as rare as hen's teeth&mdash;more myth than reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under normal circumstances, Osborne wouldn't stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Isa had told him he was treading a new path in his cultivation. With the Breath of Celestial, there might be a sliver of a chance he could directly forge a Level Seven </span><span>Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even that was just a possibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more likely outcome? He could end up with a Divine Body that didn't even measure up to Level One&mdash;a glorified piece of junk, really.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne understood how crucial it was to forge a Divine Body, so he had planned to resolve all his pressing matters first and then find a completely secure place to enter seclusion, taking his time to craft the perfect Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now? He couldn't wait any longer!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The current situation was too perilous. The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was actively initiating the second phase of merging with his body. With his current state, Osborne simply couldn't bear it. The only outcome was collapse and death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In light of this, he had no choice but to gamble everything and quickly forge his Divine Body. It was his only shot at enduring the overwhelming force of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity and surviving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, despite being woefully unprepared, he dove headfirst into the process of forging his Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne began to channel the Breath of Celestial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he was no stranger to using it for this purpose&mdash;his right leg bone had already transformed into Divine Bone long ago&mdash;the process had been aided by the automatic operation of the Breath of Celestial and the power of the Powerstone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his right leg bone was just one small piece of the puzzle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The human body contained over two hundred bones, and each one needed to undergo transformation to create a complete Divine Bone. And even that wasn't enough; he also needed to forge Divine Flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only when he combined Divine Bone and Divine Flesh would he have a true Divine Body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath, grounding himself as the Breath of Celestial activated. Instantly, a rich surge of energy enveloped him, beginning to seep into his body and refine his bones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain, noticing Osborne's actions, exclaimed in surprise, "Starting to forge Divine Bones, huh? Hmph! You're pretty clever, kid. Your only shot at survival now is to make your body stronger. If it can withstand the vibrations from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, you might just make it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too bad, though&mdash;it's way too late!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the time your Divine Bones and Divine Flesh are done, you'll be long dead. Your corpse might even start smelling by then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just give up, kid!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Use what little time you have left to think and maybe leave a last message for your loved ones to collect your remains."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne paid no heed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guided by the Breath of Celestial, fearsome power surged into his body, rapidly forging his every bone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was racing against death itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body continued to crumble, and if Osborne couldn't halt the disintegration soon, he would indeed perish long before his Divine Bones and Flesh could be completed, as Cain had predicted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not enough! The power is not enough!" Osborne gritted his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this cave, 12 miles deep beneath the surface, the concentration of natural energy was at least a hundred times that of the ground level above. This energy was pouring into Osborne's body with fervent intensity, yet he still felt it was insufficient for his needs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forging a Divine Body required an immense amount of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more potent the Divine Body, the more energy it demanded. Under normal circumstances, Osborne could take all the time he needed to absorb more power. Even with low concentrations of natural energy, longer durations could enable him to gather enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, time was not on his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to expedite the forging of Divine Bones and Divine Flesh to address his collapsing body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with the energy concentration here being a hundred times stronger, it felt woefully inadequate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperation gnawed at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Utilizing the Breath of Celestial, he voraciously devoured the surrounding energy, but the forging of his Divine Bones remained painfully slow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this rate, he would undoubtedly die before his Divine Bones could undergo transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What can I do?"</span></p></div>
