        <h1>Chapter 1382 Hope</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After several Class S </span><span>Deathborns</span><span> were taken down, the high-grade death scent they left behind barely made a dent in restoring the wilting Primordial Crimson Lotus of </span><span>Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that the essence from Class S </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> was far too scarce to make a significant impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sighed, frustration creeping into his thoughts. "Even if I took down thousands or even hundreds of thousands of Class S </span><span>Deathborns</span><span>, it wouldn't be enough to revive the Lotus to a point where it can heal me. This is just not going to cut it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew he had to take a risk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I want the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to recover, I'll need to hunt down higher-tier </span><span>Deathborns</span><span>. The more powerful the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> I take down, the more death scent I'll get, and the better it will be for the Lotus. But going after Junior Deity </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> in my current state? That's a tall order."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His thoughts were interrupted as he spotted two Junior Deity </span><span>Deathborns</span><span> still oblivious to his presence, wandering aimlessly, clearly confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "I </span><span>gotta</span><span> take them out, no doubt about it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, dealing with a Junior Deity right now is a bit of a gamble, but if I don't step up, that Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity will never recover, and neither will my injuries or my power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm the Blood Clan's progenitor, I got that natural edge over the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>. They can't bring their full game when they're up against me. If I'm too chicken to mess with a Junior Deity </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, what am I </span><span>gonna</span><span> do when I face other Junior Deities?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just roll over and die? That is not the way to live!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, Junior Deities are just scraping by at the bottom of the food chain. I </span><span>gotta</span><span> get back on my feet, even stronger if I </span><span>wanna</span><span> survive in this joint. So yeah, I </span><span>gotta</span><span> roll the dice, </span><span>gotta</span><span> take the risk."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a surge of determination, Osborne made his decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Divine Body is cracked and heavily injured, so I can't use too much power without risking further damage. My space elemental essence is also in rough shape, but the dark elemental essence seems to be holding up well. As long as I manage my strength, I should be able to handle a Junior Deity </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a plan in mind, he slipped behind one of the Junior Deity </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to his full use of the Eclipsing Mantra, the creature had no idea he was there, mistaking him for just another rock in the terrain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until he launched his attack that the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> finally reacted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But by then, it was far too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's fist, imbued with dark energy, slammed into the </span><span>Deathborn's</span><span> back, piercing straight through its body and releasing a cloud of death scent into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> howled in pain, enraged but still standing, turning to engage Osborne in a fierce battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had been at full strength, taking down a Junior Deity </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> would have been a walk in the park. But now, every moment was a struggle, and he found himself in tight spots more than once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, the aura of the Blood Clan founder instilled enough fear in the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> that they held back at crucial moments, giving Osborne just the openings he needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a grueling exchange, he finally managed to bring the Junior Deity </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> down, panting heavily from the exertion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as he caught his breath, the other Junior Deity </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, sensing the commotion, charged toward him. There was no time to rest; he had to prepare for another fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what felt like an eternity, Osborne staggered to a halt, bloodied and exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Junior Deity </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> lay defeated at his feet, but the battle had taken its toll. He had pushed himself too hard, worsening the injuries to his already battered Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least I finally took them down," Osborne said, a mix of relief and pain washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The death scent left behind by these Junior Deity </span><span>Deathborns</span><span> was far more potent than that of Class S </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>. As the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity absorbed the rich essence, its withered appearance began to soften.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could feel a stirring within the roots, as if part of the Lotus was awakening from a long slumber. A gentle energy radiated from the roots, gradually mending his wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joy surged through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This really works! Just two Junior Deity </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, and the Lotus' roots are already coming back to life, helping me heal. If this keeps up, it won't be long before the Lotus is fully restored! At the very least, my injuries will be healed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes sparkled with hope and eagerness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of hunting down more </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> was tantalizing, but he knew he had to exercise caution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Defeating two Junior Deity </span><span>Deathborns</span><span> had taken a toll on him, and he needed to rest. "I should head back and let the Lotus work its magic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No need to rush! I've figured out how to recover so I can afford to take a day off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Lotus' help, I'll definitely regain some strength and won't struggle as much against the Junior Deity </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> next time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tomorrow, I'll take down even more of them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, Osborne turned to make his way back to Rodriguez Village.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he approached, he noticed a crowd gathered around the stone house where Harry and his sister lived. The group looked </span><span>menacing,</span><span> their expressions twisted with malice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and his sister stood at the edge, their faces pale with fear.</span></p></div>
