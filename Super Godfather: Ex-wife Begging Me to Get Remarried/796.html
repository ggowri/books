        <h1>Chapter 796 Fierce Battle</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That was just a warm-up. Did you really think you were that good?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert scoffed coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"From now on, you won't get any chances. Think you can end my winning streak? You're not worthy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Come at me again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert launched another attack but was still not using his&nbsp;Strength Realm. While Osborne's strength was considerable, it still fell short compared to his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If not, it would've been Osborne stumbling back five steps, not him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this point, Cuthbert was confident he could still defeat Osborne without wasting too much energy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was still aiming for eighty consecutive wins.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne stood his ground. Though his power didn't match Cuthbert's, the gap wasn't huge. If Cuthbert didn't change his tactics, neither would he.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If it's a head-to-head, so be it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bring it on!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bam, bam, bam, bam!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the stage, the two figures clashed fiercely. For every punch Osborne took, he returned one. He unleashed his&nbsp;Spiral Force,&nbsp;Ninefold Tide Crash,&nbsp;Point Blank Force, and even&nbsp;Deadly Force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne had mastered these advanced martial arts techniques to their&nbsp;extreme level.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert wasn't far behind. Though his mastery of advanced techniques wasn't quite at Osborne's level, his superior strength kept Osborne on the defensive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was forced to retreat continuously under his attacks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But only Cuthbert knew how painful Osborne's strikes were. Each punch caused stinging pain throughout his body, almost unbearable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn it! His advanced techniques are even better than mine?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And what is that move? His strength bypasses my defense and attacks my internal organs! If my body hadn't fused with that ancient artifact, I'd be gravely injured by now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert's expression darkened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had mastered techniques like&nbsp;Spiral Force,&nbsp;Ninefold Tide Crash, and&nbsp;Stretch Soft Force, all to proficiency level, but he hadn't learned&nbsp;Deadly Force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's&nbsp;Deadly Force&nbsp;bypassed his defenses and directly struck his internal organs, causing him great discomfort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This kid's more troublesome than I thought. If this keeps up, I might be unable to beat him, and I'll waste too much strength. Even if I win, I'll lose the chance for eighty straight victories.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I need to finish him off quickly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can't waste any more time!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that in mind, Cuthbert was done waiting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Strength Realm!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He unleashed his&nbsp;Strength Realm&nbsp;in full force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert's strength was amplified several times over inside his Strength Realm, while Osborne's was suppressed. With this shift, Osborne couldn't block his strikes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their fists collided again, but this time Osborne felt like he had been hit by a freight train. He coughed up blood as his body flew backward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thud!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne finally stopped at the edge of the stage, wiping the blood from his mouth. He looked at Cuthbert with a mocking grin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Couldn't hold back from using your&nbsp;Realm?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I thought you were tougher than that. Couldn't resist using your&nbsp;Realm&nbsp;already?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert's face twisted in anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was the first time he had used his&nbsp;Realm&nbsp;before his opponent. It was a sign of weakness, and hearing Osborne call it out infuriated him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hmph!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I just didn't want to waste any more time with you! The sooner I beat you and get my fiftieth win, the sooner I can focus on tougher opponents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll hit sixty wins, then seventy, then eighty! I'll use that momentum to break through the AAA bottleneck and become an&nbsp;S-Class Supreme Overlord!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And you're just a stepping stone! After today, you won't even be worthy to fight me again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert was brimming with confidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The power boost from his&nbsp;Realm&nbsp;made him feel invincible, as if no one could stand in his way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Go ahead, show me your&nbsp;Realm!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've heard you're one of the rare spatial metahumans. I've heard your&nbsp;Spatial Domain&nbsp;is tricky. In front of me, it's as fragile as glass!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll shatter it with one punch before you even get a chance to use it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing this, Osborne smiled faintly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is that so?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since you insist, I'll oblige! Do you think you can break my&nbsp;Realm with one punch? Give it a shot!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Osborne's thoughts shifted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Light Realm!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Whoom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, Osborne's body seemed to transform into a small sun, radiating an intense brightness. Wherever the light reached, it became part of his&nbsp;Realm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Multicolored beams of light intertwined, creating a dazzling&nbsp;Light Realm&nbsp;that made everything feel like a vivid dream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Light Realm!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne knew his&nbsp;Spatial Domain&nbsp;wasn't stable enough yet and would be easily shattered by Cuthbert, making it useless in this fight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That's why he chose to reveal his&nbsp;Light Realm&nbsp;instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's fight!"</p></div>
