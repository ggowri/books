        <h1>Chapter 767 Rhett Challenges Andrew</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone had witnessed the strength of Clay and Satoru during yesterday's matches.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">People thought both Clay and Satoru had a real shot at breaking into the Godson Rankings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But both were brutally defeated by Emi and Samuel, who were already on the Godson Rankings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The gap in strength was just too wide!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, no one felt confident enough to challenge them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is this the power of the Godsons? We stand no chance if even Clay and Satoru were easily beaten!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If we rush into a challenge, we might end up badly hurt!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I was considering it, but now it seems I need another two years of training."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Same here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The arrogance from the crowd disappeared, and one by one, they gave up on the idea of challenging.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The once bustling arena suddenly grew quiet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jackie noticed the shift but calmly asked, "Anyone else want to challenge? If not, I'll take down the platform."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After he spoke, the crowd remained silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Godsons on stage looked down at the crowd with disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What a bunch of losers!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you don't even dare to challenge, you're never going to reach the top!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Pathetic!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The insults from the Godsons made the crowd furious. They were all elite young fighters, some of the strongest in their families, organizations, and even countries.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Proud and confident, how could they tolerate such humiliation?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Someone, unable to contain their anger, immediately jumped onto the platform.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll challenge!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm up!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Me too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Several others followed, each challenging those ranked at the bottom of the Godson Rankings, giving it everything they had.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But in the end, each one was effortlessly defeated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their once confident skills and strategies seemed laughable against the Godsons, posing no threat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hahaha!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What a bunch of trash!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"With that kind of power, you think you can replace us and become the new Godsons?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Pathetic!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Come back after another ten years of training!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Losers!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Godsons sneered even more, their taunts growing harsher.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd was livid, but there was nothing they could say to fight back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Every challenger had failed up until this point.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was no hope of winning in sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The power gap was too large.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"They're pretty strong!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Osborne murmured quietly, his expression serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These Godsons were powerful!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne felt that even if he fought them, victory would be hard-earned and take a lot of effort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking about his upcoming Honor Quest Ceremony in just over twenty days, where all these fighters would challenge him one after the other...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne couldn't help but feel a chill run down his spine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Most alarming was that these Godsons were ranked at the lower end of the Godson Rankings. The higher-ranked ones hadn't even shown up yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How powerful must those top-ranked Earth Godsons be?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's face grew even more serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Anyone else want to challenge?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Emi had swept another challenger off the platform, Jackie asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd remained silent once more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their confidence had been shattered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Osborne noticed Rhett move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rhett took a deep breath and walked toward the platform, stepping onto it quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Staring Andrew down, he said coldly, "Andrew, fight me! This time, I will defeat you! I'll repay you for all the humiliation you've put me through!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After speaking, Rhett unleashed his powerful energy, his fighting spirit igniting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hahaha!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew burst into laughter, his face full of mockery. "Rhett, you're really stubborn! After being defeated and humiliated by me so many times, you still won't give up, and you dare challenge me again?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well then, I'll just have to humiliate you again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Andrew stepped onto the platform.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fight!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rhett wasted no time and launched his attack. Intense flames engulfed the platform, turning it into a world of fire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was the Fire Realm!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rhett's Fire Realm was vast, and the searing heat forced the crowd to step back in discomfort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Andrew remained calm on the platform.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Rhett, it's been a while, and you're still using the same tricks! Pathetic. Beating you doesn't even give me a sense of accomplishment."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, he raised his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Time to lose!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A torrent of water appeared, sweeping across the platform and instantly quenching Rhett's Fire Realm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thud!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rhett spat out blood.</p></div>
