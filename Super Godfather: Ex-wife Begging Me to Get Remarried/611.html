        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Everett glared at Godfather angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're shady, Sebastian. Did you already know that his light elemental power was given by Ms. Night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather smiled faintly, "I was just guessing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I believe she's the only one bold enough to disregard the League of Divine Descent's agreement."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett's expression shifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He snorted coldly and murmured, "Times have changed. Right now, we, the League of Divine Descent, are giving her face, but that may not last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll see!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Everett erupted in a burst of dazzling light, rapidly healing his injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather observed calmly, with a hint of a mocking smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett scoffed, "Sebastian, keep today's events to yourself. If you upset me, I'll ally with the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather frowned but replied calmly, "Don't worry. I have no interest in sharing this, and Ms. Night prefers silence, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's better!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett sighed in relief. "But don't get complacent. There's still no clear winner in this betting match. Even if I don't pursue that kid for blasphemy, your Augustine family might not prevail!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't forget, the Rosenthal family still has two spots left to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll all be consumed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get the divine artifacts ready!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Everett ignored Godfather and quickly left the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in Arena Number One, the Augustine family anxiously awaited Godfather's return, knowing the outcome of his battle with Everett would determine their future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, both returned simultaneously, taking their seats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd eagerly looked to them for the results, but their expressions revealed nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Rosenthal..." a few from the Rosenthal family murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before they could finish, Everett coldly interrupted, "The betting fight continues. Sene lost the previous battle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at Osborne, coldly dismissing the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His declaration stunned the Rosenthal crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Rosenthal, are you not going to hold him accountable? He privately possesses light elemental power. It is blasphemy against the gods. How can you let him go?" someone said loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family members were equally shocked. The gambling fight continued? Randall would not pursue Osborne's crime of blasphemy against the gods? Would he </span><span>not take Osborne to the Mount of Gods to be executed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's happening?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did Godfather and Everett strike a deal?" they speculated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett snorted, "I just learned that the League of Divine Descent has canceled Divine Accord from decades ago. Light elemental power is no longer exclusive to the League.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Gods are benevolent. Everyone has the right to this power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Therefore, he is not guilty."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With difficulty, Everett closed his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was stunned. Divine Accord made decades ago was canceled? The light elemental power was no longer exclusive to the League of Divine Descent?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone could possess it, and it wasn't considered blasphemy against the gods?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was Osborne not guilty?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family looked at Osborne, relieved by his unexpected fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The League of Divine Descent wouldn't wage war against them over this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was surprised. Was Divine Accord canceled? Was his possession of light elemental power now acceptable? Was he not guilty?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned, sensing something was off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could such an important agreement be canceled just like that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, even Everett didn't know the news in advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Things can't be this coincidental. Did Godfather make a deal with the League of Divine Descent to protect me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne bit his lip, but he had no time to ponder as the betting fight was about to resume.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having defeated Sene, only two spots remained for the Rosenthal family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne could defeat two more opponents, he could turn the tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the Rosenthal crowd, a woman stepped forward, glaring at Osborne. She couldn't accept that a lowly person like Osborne had light elemental power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It should only be possessed by the noble Divine Descent like them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, don't get too comfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even without Divine Accord, we, the Divine Descents, won't tolerate a lowly person like you possessing light elemental power. People like you are heretics and should be eradicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I will defeat you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your light elemental power won't save you because only we, the Divine Descents, can wield true light power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember my name, Melanie Rosenthal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm ranked fifteenth among the Godsons of </span><span>Yalynch</span><span>, and I will be the one to defeat you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Melanie knelt, raising her hands high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a devout expression, she called out, "Light, grant me strength!"</span></p></div>
