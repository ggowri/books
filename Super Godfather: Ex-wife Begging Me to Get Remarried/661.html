        <h1>Chapter 661 Killing Vampire</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne grabbed Vampire's bloodline. At that moment, he felt the immense power and life force within the blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if he wasn't just holding blood but Vampire's life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So that's how it is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's lips curled up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He activated his Thunder Power. A streak of lightning shot into the blood, crackling loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vampire's body stiffened in the distance. He was surrounded by lightning, which scorched his entire body black.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his life force was still incredibly strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like that's not enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered and swiftly switched the lightning to flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, Vampire had used flames to burn Osborne's blood. Now, the tables had turned. It was Osborne's turn to burn Vampire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahh!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vampire's body erupted in intense flames that couldn't be extinguished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only way to put out the flames was to extinguish the fire in Osborne's palm that was scorching his blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Osborne's transformation into a Vampire made them feel he was facing the Blood Clan ancestor. He didn't even dare to look Osborne in the eye, let alone attack him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Ahhh</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vampire let out a horrified scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help me! Someone </span><span>help</span><span> me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only cry out for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! Your life force is tough! Looks like lightning and fire won't kill you. Then try this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Osborne activated the light elemental.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Purify!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The light elemental's power shone on Vampire's blood. Instantly, his body began to melt bizarrely, like ice under a scorching sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It melted from the inside out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vampire roared in agony, but he couldn't stop his body from melting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All his blood sprayed out, held in Osborne's hand. The light elemental purified the power within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body was also being purified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His skin became dry and wrinkled. His eyes turned dull and lifeless. All his blood was purified, and his life force quickly faded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Vampire's withered body collapsed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vampire's blood began to compress in Osborne's palm, quickly forming a beautiful blood pearl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You killed Vampire No. 8?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa, Titan, and Werewolf watched helplessly as Vampire died. They were furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can't hold back anymore! If we don't go all out, we won't just fail to kill him. We'll all die here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's use our ultimate moves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa gritted her teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Titan and Werewolf looked serious but nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tauren was dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Vampire was dead, too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was too unpredictable. If they didn't use their ultimate moves now, they'd be the next to die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stared at Osborne, their expressions grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took the opportunity to heal his injuries. He had endured too many attacks to kill Vampire, and his body was severely wounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He focused on the blood pearl in his palm. It was formed from Vampire's blood, </span><span>containing all his power and energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking for a moment, Osborne controlled his blood-red hair to pierce the blood pearl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, the blood-red hair began to absorb the power of the blood pearl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could feel the Blood Cross in his body frantically devouring the blood pearl's power, growing stronger and stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the blood pearl was completely gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of the Blood Cross had become incredibly dense, as if it had overindulged. The overflow of power gave Osborne a significant boost, making his body feel immensely stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a surge of joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, his Satan's Eye began to pulse wildly, sensing an immense danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, die now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forcing the three of us to use our ultimate moves to kill you, you should be proud!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'd die now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa shrieked. Blood poured from her eyes as she shot a magma-like, scorching gaze directly at Osborne's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Death, Ashes!" Medusa shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa roared furiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne felt his body freeze, as if he'd turned to stone. A searing force erupted from within him, threatening to turn him into molten rock and then ash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression changed drastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Death Ashes?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is Medusa's true ultimate move? The martial art aura can't defend against it at all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne's body was completely immobilized, with only his mind still active.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt like a stone burning from the inside, unable to stop until he turned to ash.</span></p></div>
