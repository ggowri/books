        <h1>Chapter 322 Taking Action</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had anticipated this, but he still couldn't help but snort coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression turned cold as he said, "Who does he think he is, to talk to me like this? And instead of coming himself, he sends a lackey?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you say!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yohan's confident demeanor vanished, replaced by fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dare insult Mr. Paltrow and call me a lackey?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're asking for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying pressure erupted from Yohan, directed at Osborne. The previously clear sky turned ominous, dark clouds rolling in and obscuring the sunrise. Passengers on </span><span>the cruise were bewildered, unaware of what was happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Yulissa, Ryan, and Nathan on the fifteenth deck understood, their faces paling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think you're doing, Yohan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan stepped forward, glaring angrily at Yohan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yohan clenched his teeth. "Ryan, if you don't want to die, get out of my way! This trash dared insult me and Mr. Paltrow. I must teach him a lesson, or my family's honor will be tarnished!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Yohan clenched his fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thunder flickered within the dark clouds, as if ready to strike at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Paltrow family's inherited power was the control of lightning elemental.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the younger generation, including Yohan, had awakened this ability. The lightning Yohan controlled was far more powerful than any Osborne had encountered before. If it struck, the Alisa Ship would suffer significant damage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression grew cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to fight here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yohan smirked. "What, are you scared? If you apologize to me and Mr. Paltrow, I might let you go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you must stay away from Pinchide City until Mr. Paltrow's wedding with Clarissa is over. You can't appear before me again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled. "And if I refuse?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yohan laughed. "Do you dare refuse? Don't think being the Augustines' heir means you can act tough with me! You know your family's current situation. Can you afford to offend me? Can you afford to offend the Paltrow family? If you refuse, you will die, and your family will be destroyed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Paltrow said if you were smart, I should spare you. But if not... I won't hesitate to throw you into the sea to feed the fish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yohan's confidence returned as he resumed speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll give you ten seconds to decide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, I'll make my move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ten!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yohan began counting down, while Yulissa, Ryan, and Nathan, outraged at Osborne's humiliation, felt utterly powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Paltrow family's strength was overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given their family's current plight, they couldn't afford to antagonize the Paltrow family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, I'll fight them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan, his temper flaring, couldn't hold back and prepared to attack Yohan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stopped him, watching Yohan count down with a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't need to count. I won't agree. If you want to fight, then come on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have a death wish!" Yohan roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you don't know your place, I'll show you why you should fear the Paltrow family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yohan summoned the thunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying bolt of lightning tore through the air, heading straight for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, watch out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, be careful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, be careful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa, Ryan, and Nathan shouted in alarm, feeling the immense power of the lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yohan was one of the best in the Paltrow family's younger generation. Three years ago, he had already broken through to become a Class B+ metahuman, and his power had grown significantly since then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Ryan had no confidence in facing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could Osborne withstand this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood his ground. As the lightning struck, he didn't dodge but calmly raised his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying bolt of lightning touched Osborne's hand and instantly transformed from a deadly force into a harmless, writhing pet. It moved gently in Osborne's palm without causing any harm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lowering his hand, Osborne looked at the twisting lightning in his palm and smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to throw me into the sea to feed the sharks?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perfect, I had the same idea! Let's see who ends up in the sea."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne counterattacked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, he sent a bolt of lightning back at Yohan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yohan's face changed drastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted and shattered the lightning, but before he could react, Osborne was already in front of him, reaching for his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yohan desperately tried to dodge, but Osborne's physical prowess was akin to a </span><span>master's</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, Osborne grabbed Yohan's shoulder, causing him to scream in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, Osborne's heavy slap landed on Yohan's contorted face.</span></p></div>
