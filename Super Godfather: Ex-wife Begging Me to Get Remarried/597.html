        <h1>Chapter 597 Detoxify and Death's Stare</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma pointed at the woman and said coldly, "You, do you dare to come out and fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, the woman smiled faintly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, she slowly walked out, saying, "I knew you would choose me. You're smart; you know that only by defeating me does the Augustine family have a chance to win. Unfortunately, you chose the wrong opponent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My name is Aria Rosenthal. I am ranked sixth among Yalynch's Godson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were able to defeat Gordon, which shows your strength is quite impressive. But it was mainly because your power countered his. In front of me, you don't stand a chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Aria finished speaking, she stood opposite Emma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma sneered, "You're very confident, but unfortunately, I'm even more confident than you! So what if you're Yalynch's sixth-ranked Godchild? I will still defeat you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so? Then let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Aria finished speaking, a magnificent scepter suddenly appeared in her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the top of the wand was a dazzling gemstone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It emitted a rich, blood-red light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the power of the wand, Emma frowned but showed no fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pointed her finger at Aria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Freeze!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crack! Crack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Layers of ice crystals suddenly appeared on Aria's body, rapidly covering her and attempting to freeze her completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was how Gordon had been defeated earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Aria remained unfazed, a faint smile playing on her lips. She gently tapped her chest with the wand in her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, a crimson light erupted, swiftly enveloping her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ice encasing her vanished without a trace as if it had never existed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's expression changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Detoxify?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria raised an eyebrow. "You seem to know a lot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's face turned cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, most of the Augustine family members looked bewildered, exchanging puzzled glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's Detoxify?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Vincent looked clueless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew's expression grew serious. "Detoxify is a variation of light elemental power, a very unique and rare ability. It's said to be able to remove any adverse effects and restore one's state. Emma tried to freeze her, but she used Detoxify to break free instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Against someone with Detoxify, unless you can kill them quickly before they have a chance to use it, they're practically invincible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as they can cast Detoxify, they can return to peak condition."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Matthew finished speaking, Vincent was astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That powerful? Isn't that the ultimate healing ability? As long as you're not dead, you can recover?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew shook his head. "Not exactly. Casting Detoxify consumes a lot of energy. She can't use it indefinitely; eventually, she'll run out of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And, when fighting someone with Detoxify, you just need to prevent them from using it! For example, by severely injuring their soul or mental strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, the tide of the battle suddenly turned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma sneered, "So you have Detoxify? Well, I'll just make sure you can't use it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she tapped her temple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, an invisible wave of energy surged toward Aria like a tidal wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria's face paled, and blood trickled from the corner of her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She brandished her wand, enveloping her head in a crimson glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A psychic attack?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria gasped. "I never expected you to possess such potent mental power! But do you think I'm unaware of my own weaknesses? I've trained my mind just as diligently. Your psychic assault won't defeat me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The red light shielded Aria's head, blocking Emma's relentless psychic onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's expression hardened. "Is that so? Are you sure you can withstand it? To enhance my psychic abilities, I would lock myself in the dungeon whenever I had the chance, enduring its terrifying mental torment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't hold out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria retorted coldly, "Then let's see who breaks first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma and Aria were locked in a dangerous and eerie mental duel. Emma sought to inflict severe damage upon Aria's soul, knowing it was the only way to win this battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, as long as Aria could activate Detoxify, she would rapidly recover from any physical attacks Emma launched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The time was ticked by slowly. Maintaining the psychic assault was taking its toll on Emma, her face growing increasingly pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria wasn't faring much better. Emma's mental strength surpassed hers, and she was nearing her limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both women persisted, their wills unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first to falter would lose this fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the spectators held their breath, their eyes glued to the two combatants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family silently cheered for Emma, hoping she could pull off a victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the Yalynch camp wore grave expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of them had expected that Emma, at only twenty-five years old, could fight Aria, their most vital member, to such a degree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a way, Emma had already won.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, it was Emma who faltered first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several years younger than Aria, her experience and reserves were ultimately lacking. She couldn't maintain the mental onslaught any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma suddenly coughed up a mouthful of blood, her face deathly pale as she dropped to one knee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now's my chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria rejoiced, finally seeing an opening to counterattack. She unleashed a crimson beam of light, aiming it directly at Emma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in that split second, an overwhelming sense of danger washed over her. The kneeling Emma abruptly raised her head, and her right pupil vanished, replaced by a chilling, pure white.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Death's Stare!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hum!</span></p></div>
