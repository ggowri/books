        <h1>Chapter 257 Ophelia Was Stunned</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Welcome!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Ophelia spoke, Wesley spoke hurriedly with a respectful and fawning look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who was Clarissa?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was the daughter of the Radcliffe family. Although the Radcliffe family was not considered vital among the six prominent families in </span><span>Skyefall</span><span>, wealthy families like the Ashford family and the Caldwell family were definitely not comparable to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hundred the Ashford family and the Caldwell family were not as good as the Radcliffe family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Wesley not greet her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Ophelia felt that Clarissa's appearance had stolen her limelight and felt vaguely uncomfortable, she did not dare to show it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly expressed her welcome to Clarissa with flattery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for some reason, she found Clarissa had been staring at her, and there seemed to be a hint of competition in Clarissa's cold eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It confused Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Did I offend her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia was a little worried, thinking, "Is it because of Osborne? That bastard is so good at currying favor with women, and now he is Clarissa's bodyguard. He even saved Clarissa when they were young. Could it be that he </span><span>badmouth</span><span> about me to Clarissa so Clarissa is hostile to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia became a bit angry at this thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, she blamed it on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't dare to say anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, congratulations. I'll go in first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa didn't say much. She withdrew her gaze indifferently and walked into the Rose Castle with her people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the Rose Castle became </span><span>more lively</span><span> because of Clarissa's arrival. All the heads and heirs of various wealthy families, even gang leaders and wealthy celebrities, gathered around her and complimented her, trying to curry favor with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, they were all blocked and couldn't get close to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a situation made Ophelia bite her lip, and she was furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "It's my wedding!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm the female lead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the arrival of Clarissa, Ophelia felt that Clarissa took away all the spotlight that belonged to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was obviously the bride and should be the most stunning person today. But everyone's attention was shifted to Clarissa, who was even more stunning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ophelia couldn't vent her anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Be it appearance, figure, identity, or background, she was utterly incomparable to Clarissa. Even the jewelry Clarissa wore was more dazzling than hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the Ocean Whisper Sapphire she had wanted before, but Clarissa won the bid. It was worth 100 million dollars!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia was outraged. She felt that she was inferior in everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did she come here dressed up? Did she do it on purpose?" whispered Ophelia angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley noticed that she was in a bad mood and quickly comforted her. "Ophelia, calm </span><span>down. She is Clarissa. With her status, her attendance at our wedding is our honor. We can't ask her to dress ordinarily, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A woman like her is destined to shine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia still bit her lip. "But she obviously doesn't have to wear such precious jewelry! She definitely did it on purpose. She wants to outshine me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't care. I'm the bride today. How can I be inferior to her in everything?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley had a headache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said quickly, "Ophelia, don't worry. You're the female lead today. I promise you will be better than her as the wedding starts! My grandmother has a set of jewelry worth more than 300 million dollars. It is more dazzling and precious than the Ocean Whisper Sapphire. I'll ask someone to get it! You can wear that set of jewelry at the wedding, and I promise you will be better than Clarissa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia became happy at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia was excited. She was highly expectant at the thought of appearing wearing jewelry worth 300 million dollars and shining brightly, even outshining Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Today, I am the bride!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I am the one who is the most beautiful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two continued to welcome guests. As the wedding time got closer, the number of coming guests became smaller.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who should come had already come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The huge main castle of Rose Castle was already filled with guests. Everyone was waiting for the wedding to begin officially.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on. We should get ready."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, Wesley prepared to leave with Ophelia to change into their wedding dresses and suits and make final preparations before the wedding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that moment, a car slowly drove over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was an ordinary Audi, priced at no more than one million dollars. On an occasion like today, it looked inconspicuous and even a little shabby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley and Ophelia just glanced at it. They decided to ignore it and let others greet the person inside it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the next second, when the car door opened, they stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They both stared at the man getting out of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Osborne who came in a hurry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was wearing a fitted suit that perfectly showed his tall and strong figure. His handsome face stunned Ophelia instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Is this Osborne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia was shocked. She looked at Osborne, who seemed to have become a completely different person. He became more handsome and looked more noble. Even Wesley, who was dressed up, could not compare to him. Ophelia was utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "How could it be him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When did he become like this?"</span></p></div>
