        <h1>Chapter 1404 The Panicked Siblings</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia stood frozen, speechless. If not for Osborne's divine power shielding them, the last two Intermediate Deities' splattered blood would have soaked them to the bone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only when the surroundings fell into complete silence did they snap back to reality, their bodies jolted awake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both stared at Osborne in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you... killed Patrick? Man, you've really stirred the hornet's nest now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry's brows knitted </span><span>tightly,</span><span> his face etched with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow, a relaxed smile appearing on his face. "Was Patrick untouchable? He practically handed me his head on a platter. Was I supposed to invite him to dinner instead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia were taken aback once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Harry could speak, Amelia said, "Harry, this isn't the time for that. Osborne only did this to save us. If not for him, we'd be dead by now. Patrick wouldn't have shown us mercy; he would've tortured us until we died."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A menacing glint appeared in Amelia's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why should Patrick get to kill us while we can't touch him? Just because he's a reserve member of the Ninth Dark Deity Legion? He wanted us dead, and we're supposed to care about his status? That's just foolish."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then turned to Osborne, saying, "Osborne, thank you for saving us. If you hadn't, we'd both be history. We'll face the consequences of killing Patrick together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> what if we die?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When the Ninth Dark Deity Legion people come, just tell them you had nothing to do with it. Harry and I will take full responsibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should go&mdash;find a place to hide."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia tried to push Osborne away, but he looked at her with surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hide somewhere? Take the blame for Patrick's death? And you two are planning to stay here and face your fate?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia bit her lip. "What choice do we have? Patrick was killed right outside our home. Even if we run, the Ninth Dark Deity Legion will find us. Running would just put you in danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's better if we stay and let them take us. Once they've got us, the matter will be over. You should hide for a while, and you'll be safe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was both visibly anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She added, "Osborne, you need to go now! This will be discovered soon, and if anyone sees you here, the Ninth Dark Deity Legion won't show you any mercy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned. "If that's the case, then I can't leave. Too many people already saw me kill Patrick."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pointed to a cluster of stone houses in Rodriguez Village not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was night, and Harry and Amelia hadn't noticed, but with Satan's Eye, Osborne could see numerous villagers peeking through door cracks and other gaps, watching the scene unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had seen everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia followed Osborne's gaze, their faces turning pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do we do now? So many villagers have returned. Even though they didn't come over, they were definitely watching from a distance. When the Ninth Dark Deity Legion investigates, they'll spill everything. What do we do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's face was filled with worry and regret as she looked at Osborne. "Osborne, it's our fault. If not for saving us, you wouldn't have had to kill Patrick. We've dragged you into this mess."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and reassured her, saying, "Amelia, you don't need to apologize. It was you and Harry who saved me first. If not for you, I might have been killed by the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> before I even woke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you don't need to feel guilty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, killing Patrick isn't that big of a deal. It's an opportunity to make a change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you and Harry content to be lowly miners for the rest of your lives? To be slaves </span><span>to the Ninth Dark Deity Legion forever? Have you never thought about fighting back? About changing your fate?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, we're backed into a corner. We have to make a change. And the first thing we need to do is get out of here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne spoke, Harry and Amelia were stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep in their eyes, strong emotions churned, but they quickly suppressed them with reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what's the point of leaving? This mining area spans thousands of miles, and the Ninth Dark Deity Legion's warriors guard the perimeter. We can't break through!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if we somehow manage to escape, what then? With our strength, we can't survive in the wild. Those terrifying </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> would tear us apart and eat us clean," Harry said, fear evident in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia echoed his sentiments, her eyes also wide with terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained calm. "Staying here and waiting to die is worse. No matter what, we need to leave now and figure things out later. Let's head to the depths of the mine first."</span></p></div>
