        <h1>Chapter 1368 Level Nine Divine Body</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the moment when Osborne's Divine Body began its transformation, he felt a jolt of realization wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but exhale in relief. If the transformation didn't start soon, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity would abandon him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne knew better than to relax just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mix of anticipation and dread coursed through him. He yearned for his Divine Body to break through to Level Nine, yet Osborne couldn't shake the fear that even if it did, it still might not be enough to withstand the terrifying spatial tide surrounding him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that were the case, he was as good as dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If his Divine Body couldn't resist the tide's power, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity would certainly refuse to waste any more energy reviving him. It would simply leave him behind. Without the ability to resurrect, he would be left to face death alone in the depths of this space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without the ability to resurrect, he would be left to face death alone in the depths of this space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope the Level Nine Cosmic Divine Body is powerful enough to withstand the force of this spatial tide! If it is, I might just have a chance to survive and find a way out of this deep space," Osborne thought anxiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The transformation of his Divine Body seemed to stretch on for an eternity. Time lost all meaning in this profound void; it felt as though he had been waiting forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, it happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A brilliant Ethereal Glow erupted around Osborne, radiating a rich golden hue before quickly fading, leaving only transparency in its wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Golden Ethereal Glow!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the hallmark of a Level Nine Cosmic Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't understand why it vanished so quickly, reverting to transparency. He could only attribute it to the unique nature of his cultivation path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But one thing was clear: his Divine Body had successfully transformed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, his Divine Body had undeniably reached Level Nine, a level that no one in </span><span>Celestara</span><span> had ever achieved. It felt as if his very essence had evolved to a new plane of existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could sense the immense power coursing through him; every cell felt like a volcano, ready to unleash an overwhelming surge of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, this is incredible!" he murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leap from Level Eight Galactic Divine Body to Level Nine Cosmic Divine Body seemed like just one step, but the intensity of the improvement far surpassed the difference between Levels Seven and Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt invincible. Even a Celestial Deity warrior standing before him would be obliterated without a second thought!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What thrilled Osborne most was the newfound defensive capability of his Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The relentless spatial tide still raged around him, crashing against his form, but it could no longer inflict serious damage. Instead, it left only faint white traces on his Divine Body&mdash;nothing more than a superficial mark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was untouchable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overwhelmed with joy, Osborne couldn't contain his emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Level Nine Divine Body really can withstand the spatial tide! I won't be killed by it again, and I won't need the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to revive me! It won't abandon me so easily now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears of relief welled up in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Osborne understood the hardships he had endured during this time. In the depths of this space, Osborne had faced death nearly ten thousand times!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each death had been profound, each one a terror that gripped his very soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he had persevered and found a glimmer of hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Osborne was still trapped in this deep space, he could finally withstand the power of the spatial tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, his next task was clear: he had to find a way out of this abyss and return to the </span><span>Blue Planet or make his way to </span><span>Celestara</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as that thought crossed his mind, a weight settled back onto his shoulders, and his expression grew serious once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's excitement was tempered by the grim reality of his situation. Survival, even now, seemed as distant as the stars in the void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was lost in the abyss of deep space, devoid of time, orientation, or any semblance of familiarity; only darkness thicker than Satan's Eye surrounded him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He muttered, "Where the hell am I?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And which way is Blue Planet? </span><span>Celestara</span><span>? I haven't a clue."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The true riddle, however, was how to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne was lost in the depths, his only companions were the oppressive silence and the gnawing fear of eternal disorientation, leading only to an inevitable demise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He told himself, attempting to rally his spirits, "At least it's not as dire as before. I've got spatial power, and my space elemental essence is at Level Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With time, there's a chance I can break free. Once in the upper echelons, maybe I'll find something&mdash;anything&mdash;to guide my way back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mind raced, fueled by the resilience forged through countless near-death experiences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each shattered soul had reconstructed, growing stronger, making his thoughts sharper and clearer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the path back to the upper layers, to Blue Planet, or even </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, promised to be fraught with insurmountable challenges. His current might, though potent, felt insufficient against the unknown perils ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Divine Body might withstand the current spatial tides, but if they intensified, he would have to push his luck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity's resurrection quota was almost exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What I need to do right now is to complete the fifth stage of fusion with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. That's what's </span><span>gonna</span><span> get me </span><span>outta</span><span> this mess."</span></p></div>
