        <h1>Chapter 29 Made Money</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne said, &ldquo;Everyone, I have two quotas for lunch with Ms. Radcliffe. If anyone wants them, just make an offer. The highest bidder wins.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Upon hearing this, many big shots became excited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Can the quotas be sold?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They looked at Clarissa and then became excited when they saw that she did not object.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;One million dollars!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Someone immediately shouted, fearing that others would buy the quotas before him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The next second, many people started bidding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Two million dollars for a quota!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Three million dollars!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ten million dollars for two quotas!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Twelve million dollars for two quotas!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Many big shots in Mayby City were scrambling for the quotas, leaving Wesley and Ophelia dumbfounded. According to the current bidding, 20 million dollars would definitely not be enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The price would reach 30 or 40 million dollars&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was absolutely possible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley and Ophelia looked at each other. They looked frustrated and depressed, struggling with what they could do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Wesley, what should we do?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia asked in a low voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley said, &ldquo;We can only agree to that bastard! You know how important the opportunity is for our families to make connections with the Radcliffe family. As long as everything goes well, we can make ten or a hundred times the profit in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Forty million dollars! Give it to Osborne. I won&rsquo;t let him live to spend it.&rdquo; Wesley looked ferocious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia sighed and looked at Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She suddenly realized that after divorcing Osborne, she seemed not to know him anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He seemed like a completely different person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne broke into the Caldwell Manor alone, demonstrated his powerful strength and means, and even got 20 million dollars in divorce compensation from Ophelia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Later, he spent ten million dollars on a crappy painting at a charity auction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia had thought Osborne was mad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was so prodigal, and nothing would be left to him in a short time. However, the situation reversed so quickly that the painting, which was worthless in Ophelia&rsquo;s eyes, suddenly became an invaluable treasure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The big shots in Mayby City were scrambling to get it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The current price of the two quotas was more than 20 million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia was angry. Seeing Osborne being the focus of everyone&rsquo;s attention, she felt extremely unconvinced. Osborne was her ex-husband, whom she despised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Why did he become so successful after divorcing her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Okay!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia finally made a decision. She agreed to buy the two quotas for 40 million dollars. She and Wesley each paid Osborne 20 million dollars. She could afford it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But she had no way of competing for the next rare jewel, the Ocean Whisper Sapphire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, as long as she could make a connection with Clarissa, it was all worth it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Osborne, we want the two quotas for 40 million dollars,&rdquo; Ophelia said angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne laughed and immediately said loudly, &ldquo;Sorry, everyone. The two quotas have been sold. Let&rsquo;s cooperate next time.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After saying that, he looked at Ophelia and Wesley with a sneer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne said, &ldquo;Transfer the money right away. Don&rsquo;t try to play tricks, or I swear that I will give the quotas to your competitors for free.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley&rsquo;s expression changed, and he said coldly, &ldquo;Humph! It&rsquo;s just 40 million dollars.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Soon, Osborne signed an agreement with Ophelia and Wesley, and his account received 40 million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was overjoyed. He had bid ten million dollars for the painting, but soon, he made a net profit of 30 million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even though many people present did not lack money, they were all a little envious of Osborne at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They exclaimed, &ldquo;This young man is really lucky.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t always be so lucky. After all, he is just an ordinary person. Without good luck, he will return to his original position.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;He is not on the same class as us after all!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne didn&rsquo;t care what people were talking about, and he just checked the balance in his account.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">There were 149 million dollars!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne said jokingly, &ldquo;Wesley, don&rsquo;t forget the bet between us. Whoever spends less money at the auction will have to submit to the other party. I&rsquo;ve already spent ten million dollars. You have to work harder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Otherwise, you will be in embarrassment when you submit to me and acknowledge me as your superior.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Hearing Osborne&rsquo;s scornful words, Wesley clenched his fists tightly in a rage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Bastard. Don&rsquo;t be so smug. You were lucky before. Now, I know how much money is in your account. Isn&rsquo;t it just 50 million dollars?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your entire fortune. I don&rsquo;t believe you dare to run out of the money. But 50 million dollars is just my pocket money. Even if I run out of 50 million dollars, I still have money. As the heir of the Ashford family, I&rsquo;m loaded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Just wait and see who will win.&rdquo;</p></div>
