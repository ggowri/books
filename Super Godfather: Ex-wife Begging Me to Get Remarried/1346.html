        <h1>Chapter 1345 No Escape</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the number of Transcendent Deity warriors falling to Osborne's onslaught continued to rise, the coalition of three forces descended further into chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more disarrayed they became, the quicker Osborne's killing spree accelerated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A vicious cycle had begun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Eddie and the members of the Prophet Alliance stood frozen in shock, their eyes glued to the battlefield. Osborne moved like a ghost, effortlessly dispatching one Transcendent Deity warrior after another, leaving them utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's incredible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even a Celestial Deity warrior couldn't take down Transcendent Deity warriors this easily, could they?" someone murmured in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're saved! No, it's not just that we're saved; the Dark Deity Legion is finished! The Pantheon League and the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization&mdash;they're all done for!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The war raged on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The coalition's numbers had dwindled to less than a thousand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the midst of the chaos, the Blood Demon members unleashed their fury. While taking down Transcendent Deity warriors proved challenging, they easily surrounded and overwhelmed the ordinary Superior Deities, leaving them with little hope of escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The coalition teetered on the brink of collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over seventy Transcendent Deity warriors had already perished at Osborne's hands, and as their numbers dwindled, his killing became even more effortless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With fewer Transcendent Deity warriors left, the Blood Demon members found themselves gaining ground, systematically encircling and eliminating more Superior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scales of victory had tilted decisively in favor of Osborne and the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The coalition was in complete disarray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The collapse had begun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, someone could no longer contain their fear and bolted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a member of the Pantheon League!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their leader, Nelson, was wide-eyed with terror as he and over a hundred warriors spotted a weak point in the Blood Demon defenses and made a desperate break for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go! Push through!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're overwhelming us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run for your lives!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, the Pantheon League members burst through the encirclement, their faces lighting up with hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that hope quickly turned to dread as they realized a tall figure stood in their path&mdash;Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His icy gaze locked onto them, and he sneered. "Trying to escape? Dream on! I told you, today you all die here! You betrayed humanity and bowed to Lord Malevolence; your sins are unforgivable. It's time for you to repent in hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying wave of energy engulfed everyone from the Pantheon League.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They still had over a hundred members, including more than twenty Transcendent Deity warriors. If they had been united, they could have mounted a defense against Osborne's current strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But alas, fear had already taken hold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had witnessed Osborne obliterate Apocalypse Harbinger along with twenty of his guards in one fell swoop, so their terror was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with Osborne's impending attack, they had no courage to resist; instead, they scattered in panic, unable to organize any effective defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, several Transcendent Deity warriors and over thirty Superior Deities found their Divine Bodies shattered, exploding into a mist of blood under Osborne's assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In one strike, the Pantheon League had lost a third of their warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This devastating reality only deepened their fear, making them even less inclined to fight back. They cursed themselves for not having wings or four legs to flee faster, scrambling for safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was all in vain; they were doomed to fall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Eddie and the members of the Prophet Alliance finally sprang into action. They swiftly cut off the retreat of the Pantheon League, ensnaring them and blocking any chance of escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A small squad of Blood Demon members joined the encirclement, tightening the noose around their prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair washed over the Pantheon League warriors as they realized their fate was sealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a cold laugh, devoid of any mercy, and set about his slaughter once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, every last member of the Pantheon League, including their leader Nelson, was dispatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of his hand, Osborne activated Satan's Eye, sweeping through the memories of the fallen. He captured every thought and secret, sealing them deep within his mind like treasures stored in a memory palace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My parents were driven into a dark vortex by the Pantheon League. But the location of that vortex still eludes me. Only certain individuals within the Pantheon League hold the key to that knowledge...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their memories must be preserved. Once this war is over, I will scour their minds for any clues about my parents."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne turned his attention to his next target: the assassins of the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those skilled killers attempted to utilize their Stealth Arts to escape the encirclement, blending into the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But their luck ran out quickly; Osborne spotted them before they could slip away and cut them off before they had a chance to regroup. In perfect synchrony with the Prophet Alliance and the Blood Demon members, he struck them down with ruthless efficiency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he set his sights on Lord League.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And finally, the Dark Deity Legion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The brutal battle raged on for hours, a relentless storm of violence that left only carnage in its wake. At long last, the conflict came to a halt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dark Deity Legion, Pantheon League, </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, and Lord League&mdash;all of them were utterly annihilated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air was thick with the stench of blood, a scent so pervasive it felt as though it had transformed into a downpour of crimson, with Osborne methodically collecting every drop.</span></p></div>
