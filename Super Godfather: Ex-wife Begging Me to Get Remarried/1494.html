        <h1>Chapter 1493 Once His Divine Power Ran Out</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian's cold, furious voice echoed through the air, reverberating like thunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the crowd stood transfixed, watching in astonishment as two figures, like streaks of lightning, darted around each other in a furious chase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had initially thought that Osborne's ability to evade Fabian's first attack was impressive. However, as Fabian got serious and unleashed his full speed, they believed there was no way Osborne could keep up and that he would be easily dispatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But once again, reality had a way of slapping them in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne not only dodged Fabian's first strike but also managed to evade his second, third, and fourth attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he was leading Fabian in a wild circle, dancing around the furious Deity Overlord. No matter how enraged Fabian became, he couldn't even touch the hem of Osborne's garment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is Fabian really giving up on capturing Osborne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed he had decided to wear Osborne down instead, seeking to exhaust Osborne's divine power before finally dealing the finishing blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This implied that Fabian was admitting he couldn't match Osborne's speed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A collective gasp swept through the crowd, shock written all over their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although all of them were aware that the Wild Bull Clan's speed was a weakness, often leading to their warriors being taunted and toyed with by enemies on the battlefield, nonetheless, that was only within the same level of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian was a Deity Overlord warrior, while Osborne had only just broken through to the Celestial Deity level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That represented a massive gap in power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Celestial Deity realm, there were indeed those who might toy with Fabian using speed&mdash;talented individuals from speed-oriented races like the Mystic Feather Clan, Eclipse Bat Clan, or even the Crimson Ironhoof Clan&mdash;who could outpace a newbie Deity Overlord warrior if they reached the late stages of Celestial Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne? He was just a lowly member of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected that Osborne, having just stepped into the Celestial Deity realm, could outmaneuver Fabian so effortlessly, leaving the Deity Overlord at his wit's end, resorting to threats about Osborne's impending demise once his divine power ran out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone gasped, "Wow! I'm convinced that this guy must have stumbled upon an ancient deity's treasure! He's probably got a hoard of Essence Crystals, and even a legacy passed down from ancient gods!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those techniques he's using now? They've got to be from that ancient legacy! How else could a brand-new Celestial Deity from the Human Community have such unbelievable speed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even the geniuses from the Mystic Feather Clan, Eclipse Bat Clan, or Crimson Ironhoof Clan wouldn't be able to muster this kind of speed right after breaking through to the Celestial Deity level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he can master this way of boosting his speed, it could greatly enhance his survivability in combat. Once he grows even stronger, I'm betting most Deity Overlord warriors will have a tough time handling him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Terrifying!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How does this lowly human get so lucky? If only I could obtain that kind of speed technique..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd watched Osborne with newfound envy, marveling at his unexpected prowess in the midst of battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a member of the Wild Bull Clan coldly interjected, his voice laced with skepticism. "Hmph, what good is luck? He's still going to die! Just like Mr. Fabian Wolfe said, that technique to boost speed must drain a massive amount of divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no way he can keep it up for long!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His divine power will soon be spent! But Mr. Fabian Wolfe? He's a Deity Overlord warrior, overflowing with divine power and supreme control over it. In this chase, he's hardly using any energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He can sustain this for ages! Once that guy runs out of divine power and can't maintain his speed anymore, he'll be finished! Let's face it&mdash;he's only just broken into the Celestial Deity realm. Compared to Mr. Fabian Wolfe, he's practically nothing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One punch from Mr. Fabian Wolfe could turn him into paste!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd had no choice but to agree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They shared the same thoughts, understanding that while Osborne was currently dodging Fabian's relentless attacks with incredible agility, it was a fleeting spectacle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could deny that a Celestial Deity in the early stages sprinting at such speeds would rapidly exhaust their divine reserves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their eyes, Osborne could only last five more minutes at best&mdash;maybe ten if he pushed it, but likely not longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had already been fleeing from Fabian for three minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That means he's running out of time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Betty and the other members of Spark of Blaze watched anxiously as the two figures raced across the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, they were ecstatic to see Osborne darting away from Fabian's attacks, finally realizing where his confidence came from.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But joy turned to concern as the reality of the situation set in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty murmured, her brow furrowed with worry, "His burst of speed can't last long... At this rate, his divine power will be spent within minutes. What can we do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The others exchanged worried glances, feeling the weight of helplessness. This level of combat was beyond their reach; they could do nothing but watch as the intense pursuit unfolded before them.</span></p></div>
