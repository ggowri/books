        <h1>Chapter 524 Waiting for You in Newport City</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb finished speaking, and everyone turned their gaze toward Osborne, their eyes sparkling with anticipation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In just over a month, Osborne had breathed new life into the Augustine family of Dampston, transforming it into the region's undisputed powerhouse and showcasing remarkable skills and strategies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their faith in Osborne was unshakeable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They truly believed he had what it took to compete against the other eight branch bloodlines and even the main bloodline of the Augustine family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Osborne couldn't help but wear a wry smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb was setting him up for a fall!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If the main bloodline of the Augustine family caught wind of this, he'd be in deep trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And they would definitely find out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Behind Caleb, Owen and Evelynn had been silent until now, but their expressions revealed discontent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evelynn finally said with irritation etched across her face, "Mr. Caleb Augustine, are you perhaps overestimating him? What makes him think he has a shot?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure, branch bloodline members can become heads of the Augustine family, but in the last two hundred years, no branch bloodline has managed to pull it off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Occasionally, a brilliant talent emerges among the branch bloodlines, but the main bloodline is simply too powerful, with geniuses popping up left and right.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In the past two hundred years, there have been very few branch bloodline members who even made it into the top three heirs, let alone become the head of the Augustine family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She shot a dismissive glance at Osborne as she finished her point.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen chimed in, "Mr. Caleb Augustine, while my sister might be a bit blunt, she's speaking the truth. I don't see any chance for him at all."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked at Osborne with a challenging smirk, his irritation barely concealed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The members of the Dampston Augustine family felt their tempers flare, glaring at the two siblings, itching to defend Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne raised his hand, signaling for them to hold their tongues.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a smile, he turned to Owen. "If I don't have a chance, then it seems you don't either. After all, you can't even take me down."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen's face flushed with anger. "Arrogant! Did you actually win? If it weren't for Mr. Caleb Augustine stepping in, do you think you'd still be standing here talking?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne shrugged. "Before Mr. Caleb Augustine arrived, you had a full ten minutes to put me down. Unfortunately, you failed. If all the main bloodline members are like you, then I'd say I actually have a shot."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're asking for death!" Owen shouted, clearly furious and ready to throw a punch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb raised his hand to intervene, his voice calm yet firm. "Owen, don't forget the Augustine family's rules! The Dampston Augustine family is now the ninth branch bloodline. They're part of the Augustine family, too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Augustine family forbids internal strife!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If it comes to light, anyone involved will be thrown into the dungeon without hesitation!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you want to test that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen's expression darkened. He shot Osborne a death glare but ultimately restrained himself from acting out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He huffed, "Fine, when he gets to Newport City, I'll use my right to initiate a formal challenge against him! Then he'll really understand how far apart we are when I'm taking things seriously!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne snorted dismissively, uninterested in engaging further.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "The Augustine family forbids internal strife?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That's good news. If I go to Newport City to meet the Augustine family, at least I won't have to worry about open hostility since they can't act against me directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But what's this about the right to enforce challenges?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen can force a challenge on me? That's not good news."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne frowned deeply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb spoke up to explain, "Osborne, now that you're part of the Augustine family's branch bloodline, there are some family rules you need to know."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, everyone paid close attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As members of the Augustine family's ninth branch bloodline, they were expected to follow the family's rules.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb began, saying, "The Augustine family's motto is&mdash;Unity is Strength!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, the first rule of the Augustine family is that internal conflicts are strictly prohibited. No private battles are allowed. If any such conflict is discovered, no matter the status, the offenders will be thrown into the dungeons. Trust me, you don't want to experience that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"To resolve disputes, the Augustine family provides every member with three challenge rights per year. These challenges are conducted in designated areas and are meant to settle differences. Of the three rights, two can only be used to challenge individuals of the same or higher rank. The third is a forced challenge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The forced challenge right allows you to challenge someone of a lower rank, and they cannot refuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, Owen has the right to challenge you, and you have the right to challenge him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne nodded in understanding, thinking, "Only one forced challenge per year?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That's not too bad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Owen chose to use his valuable forced challenge, right against me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne sneered, saying, "I'll be waiting for your challenge."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen snorted in response and said nothing more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb's expression turned serious. "Alright, there's one last thing I need to mention before I leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In seven days, the Augustine family's current patriarch, Godfather, will be celebrating his eightieth birthday. There will be a grand birthday banquet in Newport City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"All nine branch bloodlines of the Augustine family are required to send representatives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, I hope you arrive in Newport City soon. I look forward to seeing you there."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Caleb took his leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Owen and Evelynn were reluctant, they followed him out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before leaving, Owen shot a cold glare at Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll be waiting for you in Newport City!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Bring it on if you dare!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Owen departed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne did not respond, seemingly oblivious to Owen's words, and frowned slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "So, in seven days, I need to go to Newport City?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I'll be meeting the Godfather?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he pondered this, he suddenly felt a sharp vibration from the Draco Star Wristlet on his wrist.</p></div>
