        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Draco Group was a giant in Rosmandi, its business operations spanning across every conceivable sector, unmatched by any other group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of the Rosmandians could avoid death, guns, and the Draco Group in their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within the country, no force dared to be hostile to the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least not yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, outside of Rosmandi, the situation might be different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family's Maritime Auction was held on the high seas, far beyond territorial waters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had believed that collaborating with the Draco Group would safeguard the auction from mishaps, but now he realized he had been overly optimistic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Aberrants would definitely be bold and even quite willing to take action against the Draco Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, their feud dated back decades to a time when the Aberrants still reigned as the king of the underground world in Rosmandi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not until the Godfather emerged and founded the Draco Group that the Aberrants faced its ultimate defeat. Consequently, he ascended as the new underground king.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even he was unable to destroy them, and he only drove them out of Rosmandi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the years, the Aberrants had been developing in several neighboring countries, quietly restoring its strength, hoping to return to Rosmandi and defeat the Godfather to take revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recently, there had been signs of this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's engagement with the Aberrants stemmed from their attempts to assassinate Clarissa. Initially, they deployed Class C metahumans and later sent out the Class A Power Master, Medusa!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strength of the Aberrants was absolutely terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They infiltrated Rosmandi quietly and were rapidly gaining momentum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne foresaw an imminent, earth-shaking conflict between the Aberrants and the Draco Group, as well as between the Aberrant King and the Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather might have already anticipated this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the fifth succession test he had assigned to Osborne directly required that Osborne uncover all the forces secretly colluding with the Aberrants in Dampston and eliminate their senior members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, it was certain that some ancient families there conspired with the Aberrants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most likely ones were the Paltrow family, the Luther family, and the Walker family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Will the Aberrants launch attach on this auction? Will their accomplices, the forces in Dampston, help them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pondered, "Ms. Hernandez should have realized that holding an auction on the high seas would likely lead to attacks from the Aberrants, right? Why did she agree to cooperate with the Augustine family to hold the Maritime Auction?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that she did this on purpose?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is she intentionally luring the Aberrants into action, seizing the chance to test their strength and even fight them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suddenly figured it out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had believed that Serena cooperated with the Draco Group and the Augustine family for his sake, but now, it seemed that Serena had more plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pondered, "Sure enough, these big shots can't be underestimated! I think I am using her, but in fact, she is taking advantage of me. The auction may not proceed smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ms. Hernandez is fishing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family is merely scattered food to attract the Aberrants, and I might just be the bait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was not angry because the decisive factor that determined whether he was a bait or a fisherman was his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He and the Augustine family were not strong enough, so they could only serve as the bait and the scattered food, respectively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With sufficient strength, he would join the Draco Group and fish alongside them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even as the bait, I need to have my own plans! If I can use this to gain more benefits, then being bait is not a loss."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, an idea crossed his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "The Godfather's fifth test for succession mandates that I find out all the ancient families in Dampston conspiring with the Aberrants and wipe out all their senior members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps I can use this incident to confirm who is colluding with the Aberrants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They will definitely be the main force behind the attack on the auction, and their accomplices will follow suit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, they won't just watch the Augustine family make a fortune and get through the difficulties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What I have to do is to stop their attack and capture them. This way, we can determine who is colluding with the Aberrants."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne cheered up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He started strategizing, thinking, "My current advantage lies in the fact that nobody knows I've become a Class A martial master. It only took me two days, much faster than average martial artists. Thanks to the Breath of Celestial, my strength after the breakthrough is also extremely stable, and I can control it with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So I can unleash my full power. I don't need to spend a long time stabilizing my level as Alexander did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I can completely hide my strength and deal a heavy blow to the Aberrants at a critical juncture! I will find out all the accomplices of Aberrants."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne finally walked out of the room.</span></p></div>
