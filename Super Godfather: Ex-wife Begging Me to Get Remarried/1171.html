        <h1>Chapter 1170 The Second Phase of Merge</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell is going on? How is the merging happening so fast? Even if your body is as strong as a Level Three Divine Body, </span><span>it</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s</span><span> still not a Divine Body! Without divine power, how could the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity possibly merge with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain was </span><span>dumbfounded</span><span> at the turn of events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne couldn't afford to focus on Cain's shock; he was too preoccupied with the chaos inside him. The roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity were wildly expanding, spreading towards every organ and nook of his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The slight vibrations felt like they were triggering a catastrophic quake within him&mdash;</span><span>like </span><span>a </span><span>top scale of earthquake</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cracks erupted across the surface of his body, blood pouring out in torrents. Every ounce of his flesh and bone seemed to moan in agony, writhing as if in a death throe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that if this kept up, his body would surely shatter beyond repair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression was grim, </span><span>but he was</span><span> powerless to </span><span>stop</span><span> the process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was taking charge, pushing into every farthest corner of his being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what? Is this the second phase of the merge?!" Cain's surprise</span><span>d</span><span> again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the second phase?" Osborne shot back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain's face paled as he responded quickly, "Kid, you're in big trouble! Merging the Primordial Crimson Lotus with your body isn't something you can rush through! No matter how strong you are, it has to be a gradual process&mdash;step by step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The more thoroughly the Lotus integrates with your body, the greater the benefits you'll </span><span>have</span><span>, allowing you to harness even more of its power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"According to my </span><span>experiences</span><span>, there are ten phases </span><span>before you can</span><span> fully merge with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The first phase involves the roots completely covering your organs, giving them </span><span>immense protective power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you won't gain immortality just from that. To achieve </span><span>that</span><span>, the roots must spread to every part of your body&mdash;even down to each cell!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only then can you claim the first taste of immortality! Your defenses will skyrocket, and even if your body is turned to dust, you'll be able to </span><span>recover</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, that's still not true immortality&mdash;because if your soul is obliterated, you're still done for!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The next phases involve allowing the roots to penetrate your soul, so your very soul gains the Lotus' protection. Even if your enemies manage to wipe out your soul, you could still come back to life using the power of the Lotus! That's true immortality!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback by this revelation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I need to complete the second phase to even begin to experience immortality? And it is the fourth phase that will grant me true immortality?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, I am in the middle of the second phase!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity were racing to infuse its power into every corner of his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he succeeded, Osborne would get the first glimpse of immortality!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>H</span><span>e would be able to recover even if his physical form were destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But therein lay the problem&mdash;his body was on the verge of collapse before it was done!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cain, what should I do now? I can't handle this anymore! If the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity keeps </span><span>cracking</span><span> like this, my body is going to crumble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could only hope for Cain's help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Cain's eyes were filled with astonishment and compassion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly responded, "Kid, there's only one way to save you! But we can't do it here; you need to get to the </span><span>ground </span><span>surface immediately. I'll tell you what to do once you're there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned upon hearing this. "Leave here? Go to the </span><span>ground</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain was growing impatient. "Exactly! Hurry up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't waste time! Your body could collapse any second. If you don't get to the </span><span>ground</span><span>, you'</span><span>ll be</span><span> dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brow but didn't move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, "He wants me to go to the surface? Says he can save me there? That doesn't add up! Maybe he thinks I'm </span><span>done</span><span> and wants me to take him to the </span><span>ground</span><span> before I die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then</span><span> he won't be trapped here and might </span><span>find</span><span> someone else </span><span>to help him </span><span>later..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing this, Osborne quickly replied, "Cain, </span><span>but </span><span>I can't move! I feel immobilized; I can only stay here and think of a way out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain erupted in fury. "You motherfucker! I was about to be saved, and you pull this shit?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the second </span><span>phase</span><span> of fusion, and you don't even have a Divine Body! You're fucked! Even a Deity King can't save your ass now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die already, but at least get the fuck out of here before you do!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Worthless! Fucking </span><span>useless</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain was enraged.</span></p></div>
