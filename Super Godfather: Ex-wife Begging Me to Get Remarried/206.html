        <h1>Chapter 206 Ancient Magical Weapon</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Osborne's red Devil's Light was a fusion of the earth and water elemental essences, it appeared to lack any elemental power fluctuations on the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Apollo had no idea what Osborne's power was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he had already felt the power of the red Devil's Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing an even stronger red Devil's Light approaching, Apollo's face turned pale with fear. He was already severely injured and had no way to evade the attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he could do was channel all his remaining strength to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, it was futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sense of despair overwhelmed him as he felt the red Devil's Light relentlessly crushing his body. He cried out in desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a terrifying force surged from Apollo's body, taking on the exact form of Apollo but composed entirely of dense wind elemental power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was... the soul of power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Class B metahuman generated a soul of power that could erupt to block a fatal attack in life-threatening situations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Apollo's soul of power erupted on its own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force of the soul of power collided with Osborne's red Devil's Light, causing a massive wave. The red Devil's Light was instantly destroyed, but the soul of power remained, pouring toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The soul of power?! Block it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dense red light enveloped Osborne, trying to block the counterattack from Apollo's soul of power. However, the red light was rapidly disintegrating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, as the last bit of red light shattered, the soul of power also dissipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo was shocked at this time. Seeing that even his soul of power could not handle Osborne, he was filled with despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Escape!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had to escape! If I had lost a hundred billion dollars in the bet, it would have hurt, but as long as I was alive, there was still hope."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having made up his mind, Apollo turned and fled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, "Apollo, do you think you can escape? You are dying here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne waved his hand, sending a deadly red Devil's Light like a sword streaking toward Apollo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The threat of death loomed over Apollo once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Apollo had no soul of power left to defend against this fatal attack. It looked as though he was about to be killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But suddenly, a thunderous cold snort echoed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apollo, catch the sword!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, a dark sword light cut through the air from above with terrifying force, making Osborne shiver in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne exclaimed, looking at the Black Sword descending from the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo saw the black sword and his heart soared with joy. "The ancestral sword of the Chevalier family! Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo grabbed the sword's hilt without hesitation and swung it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, a terrifying power erupted from the Black Sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's red Devil's Light was easily sliced through by the Black Sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was horrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be careful! That is the Chevalier family's ancestral sword, an ancient magic weapon with power even greater than the Draco Group's Class A individual weapons!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Osborne heard Isa's reminder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's brows furrowed deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, " An ancient magic weapon?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More powerful than the Draco Group's Class A individual weapons?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was troublesome!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo tightly gripped the Black Sword, staring at its blade, then at Osborne, as if looking at a dead man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are doomed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is an honor to let my Chevalier family's ancestral sword take care of you. Die by our ancient magic sword and rest in peace!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Apollo swung the sword at Osborne. The sword's attack was so powerful that it seemed to drain all of Apollo's remaining strength, leaving him pale and unsteady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he did not care, sneering at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying sword light from the Black Sword hurtled toward Osborne at a horrifying speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne felt himself being locked in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could not dodge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Osborne's Satan's Eye could clearly see the sword light's trajectory, an invisible suppressive force prevented him from evading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only brace for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne grunted and clenched his teeth, channeling all his red Devil's Light to block the attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, the black sword light struck the red Devil's Light. It was like a small knife cutting through leather&mdash;it faced resistance but could not be completely blocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this continued, the black sword light would break through the red Devil's Light and split Osborne in two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was in danger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he did not despair. His eyes glinted coldly as he prepared for his next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I cannot block it, then&mdash;transform!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne growled as the power from the Blood Cross tattoo on his chest surged into his body. His short hair grew rapidly, transforming into long, flowing blood-red locks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His teeth sharpened into fangs, and his fingers extended into sharp claws.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even his face became paler and more angular.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vampire transformation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Osborne's final trump card. The power from the Blood Cross tattoo was limited, and Osborne had hoped not to use it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he had no choice.</span></p></div>
