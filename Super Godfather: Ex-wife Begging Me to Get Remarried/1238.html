        <h1>Chapter 1237 Clash of the Deities</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Osborne spoke, everyone's eyes brightened with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching the raw might of a Superior Deity through the satellite feed was already terrifying. Experiencing it up close would undoubtedly be a mind-blowing spectacle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The volcanic eruption at Ransford's divine peak released towering columns of smoke and ash, quickly obstructing the satellite images and leaving them in the dark about the fate of the Byrd family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian, unable to contain his eagerness, spoke up, "Osborne, can you take us with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't very well say no. "Of course. Let's go together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting any time, he gathered Sebastian, Anastasia, Zoe, Bryce, Matthew, and Wesson. They set off toward Ransford.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The distance from Rosmandi's Newport City was less than 1200 miles&mdash;a manageable stretch for Osborne. With his current abilities, he could take a small group through interdimensional travel in a heartbeat, landing them right where they needed to be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, they transitioned from the safety of the Augustine Bastion to just 60 miles away from Ransford's divine peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even at this distance, they could witness the terrifying spectacle&mdash;the peak was erupting, dark smoke billowing skyward and casting a shadow over the land for miles. It felt as if night had fallen in the middle of the day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bolts of lightning crackled through the swirling dust, illuminating the ominous scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get a bit closer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a nod, Osborne activated his spatial power, guiding the group into a parallel dimension. They zipped toward the skies above the Byrd family's estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they arrived, a fierce battle unfolded below them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Six members of the Byrd family's elite warriors burst forth from the looming peak; their faces contorted with rage at the destruction of their ancestral home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoever you are, you're going to pay for destroying the Byrd family! You've taken our lives, and now you'll face the consequences!" one warrior shouted, his voice filled with horror and fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a collective roar, they charged at Joseph and his two companions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph merely smirked at the chaos below. "Just six newly minted Junior Deities? This will be a cakewalk. They're just looking for a death wish! Finish them off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his arms crossed and confidence exuding from him, Joseph's eyes sparkled with a predatory gleam as he surveyed the remnants of the Byrd family's estate, seemingly searching for something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind him, the two Intermediate Deities from the Deschanel family sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's take them down!" they shouted in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the heart of the battlefield, two Intermediate Deities faced off against six Junior Deities from the Byrd family. It was a lopsided encounter&mdash;an inevitable fate when it came to divine ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The difference in power between realms was staggering; every tier an entity ascended led to an exponentially greater gap in strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Six Class A warriors could barely hold their ground against one Class AA, while six Class AA could go toe-to-toe with a Class AAA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, when it came to a Class S, even six Class AAA would struggle to make an impression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Six Junior Deities stood no chance against one Intermediate Deity, and the reality of the situation was painfully clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Byrd family's Junior Deities looked freshly minted, their Divine Flames barely burning overhead&mdash;dim and flickering&mdash;each only possessing a Level One Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In stark contrast, the two Intermediate Deities from the Deschanel family radiated power, their Divine Flames blazing with intensity, indicating they had reached the pinnacle of their level, each equipped with a Level Two Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chasm in their abilities was insurmountable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even as the six Junior Deities threw everything they had into the fray, it only took a few exchanges for their efforts to fall short. The Intermediate Deities danced around their clumsy attacks, launching powerful retaliations that shattered the Divine Bodies of their opponents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of delivering a fatal blow, the two Intermediate Deities opted to restrain the six Junior Deities, effectively ending the conflict in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the parallel space, Sebastian and the others were left speechless, their minds racing as they processed the sheer magnitude of the power on display.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's voice broke the stunned silence as he pointed toward one of the Junior Deities from the Byrd family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's Woody Byrd! He used to be ranked in the top twenty of the Global Quasi-Divine Rankings! I can't believe he's actually become a deity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And the other five? They're no slouches either; they're some of the Byrd family's most renowned warriors. How on earth have they all ascended?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gravity of the situation weighed heavily on Sebastian as his expression turned grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Six members of the Byrd family have reached godhood? Just how many have ascended within the League of Divine Descent? A hundred? Two hundred?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words sent a shiver down everyone's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family, with the exception of Osborne, had yet to see a single ascension to deity status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian exclaimed, urgency creeping into his voice, "We need to step up our game!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne has set us up with the best training ground, with energies a hundred times more potent, not to mention the Phoenix Ascension. If we don't break through soon, we could end up being lost in the shuffle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A new era is upon us, and it's a world where gods will reign supreme.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we can't evolve, we might just get squashed like bugs underfoot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The seriousness of his words hit home. Everyone nodded, understanding the stakes they faced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian took a breath, determination filling him. "I can't watch this any longer!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, can you take us back? I need to go into closed-door training. This time, I won't leave until I've ascended! The outside world is in your hands, so do what you must!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others, equally shaken by the revelations they had witnessed, quickly voiced their own resolutions to return and focus on their own breakthroughs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, we won't come out until we become deities!"</span></p></div>
