        <h1>Chapter 1460 Bid</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but sigh, thinking, "This is only the first batch of auction items, and they're human slaves, already..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The twenty female Human Community slaves on stage appeared youthful, destined for greatness and promising futures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, here they were, reduced to mere commodities on a bidding block.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't dare delve into how they had fallen into this condition; even if he knew, his current strength was insufficient to alter their fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he could do was buy them, ensuring they didn't end up in the clutches of other powerful factions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne remained patient, knowing that too many were still vying for these women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He intended to make his move only after the initial frenzy had settled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearby, Tiana couldn't help but furrow her brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She calmly stated, "Mr. Lachlan Swift, aren't you going to make a bid? Or perhaps these human slaves don't catch your fancy? Don't forget our agreement&mdash;you must become a VIP client of the slave market today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, even if I am inclined to let you off, my true boss behind the scenes won't be so forgiving."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes carried a subtle menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's response was nonchalant. "Why the rush, Ms. Tiana Hart?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana's tone turned icy. "Of course, I'm not anxious! But perhaps you should be! I've </span><span>just received some news, and I wonder if you would care to hear it, Mr. Lachlan Swift?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow. "What news?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana said, "News pertaining to you! Just now, the Swift family publicly announced that due to your wanton behavior and lack of respect, they have disowned you. Your actions henceforth are no longer associated with the Swift family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They've clearly cast you aside. So, are you sure you have 10 million Essence Crystals to your name? If not, don't waste my time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Causing a ruckus in the slave market demands a price!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's surprise was evident. "What? The Swift family disowned me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana sneered. "Indeed! It seems the Swift family feared being implicated by you and has severed ties. Do you still plan to struggle?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne laughed. "The Swift family disowned me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're really spineless! Oh well, if they want to disown me, so be it. I can manage just fine on my own."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's calm demeanor piqued her curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mused, "Lachlan isn't worried about being disowned?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Wild Flame City, the Swift family might not be the top dog, but they're a solid third-tier, close to second-tier, power. With the Swift family's protection, Lachlan, unless acting recklessly and causing trouble here, wouldn't face significant peril.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the other clans, despite their disdain for the Human Community, would give the Swift family some leeway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Life in Wild Flame City for the Swift family members is far better than for other members of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harsh as it sounds, others tread the streets fearing abduction, their fates uncertain, ending up here as slaves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Swift family members are insulated from such worries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lachlan's expulsion from the Swift family has left him stripped of both status and standing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why isn't he fretting?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, Tiana found herself genuinely intrigued by Osborne, curious about what gave him such unwavering composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three million!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, the auction for the first batch of female slaves had reached its zenith, with only two major factions still vying for the twenty young women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The price had soared to three million, scaring off the last of the competitors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ultimately, it was the Margery family from the Rainbow Viper Clan who emerged victorious, fending off all rivals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Rainbow Viper Clan, while not top-tier, held a solid second-rate position in Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seems like there are no other takers! Thanks, everyone, for letting us have this batch of top-notch human slaves!" announced a representative from the Margery family, grinning triumphantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though others grumbled, they had no recourse; three million was indeed a hefty sum, averaging out to a staggering 150 thousand each for these young women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a price was exorbitant for Intermediate Deity-level slaves, only justifiable given their striking beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Margery family pressed on, clearly elated. "Haha, go ahead and hammer it down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These twenty beauties will now be under the Margery family's banner!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With no further bids in sight, the auctioneer raised the hammer with a satisfied smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Any further bids? If not, then this batch of premium human slaves..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the auctioneer was about to bring down the hammer, Osborne finally made his move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I bid four million!"</span></p></div>
