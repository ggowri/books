        <h1>Chapter 966 The League of Divine Descent's Threat</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Kill them all!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wipe them out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With Osborne and Sebastian leading the charge, the Blood Demon members surged forward, their morale soaring after the swift takedown of most Class S clones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They were a well-trained unit, moving in perfect harmony, and with their two leaders at the forefront, they swept through the disorganized ranks of the Aberrants like a tidal wave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Aberrants tried to mount a counterattack, but their scattered efforts were no match for the coordinated assault of the Blood Demon members. Within moments, their lines crumbled, and chaos reigned in their ranks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Osborne dispatched the last two Tauren Kings, the Aberrants' resolve shattered completely. Panic set in, and they began to flee in all directions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What followed was a brutal massacre.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne and his team pursued the retreating Aberrants relentlessly, covering a staggering 100 miles. By the end of it, out of the 7,000 Aberrant clones, fewer than 2,000 managed to escape.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In stark contrast, Blood Demon suffered relatively light losses, with just over 300 casualties.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, even with those numbers, Osborne felt a pang of sorrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their ranks had dwindled to around 4,800, but that was the harsh reality of war. In such a brutal conflict, losses were inevitable. Trading 300 lives for over 5,000 casualties in the Aberrants was a staggering victory, but it didn't lessen the weight of those lost.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the aftermath, Osborne found himself flooded with blood energy, which he generously distributed among the Blood Demon members.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their strength began to rise once more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The number of Class AAA members surged from about 500 to over 1,000 while the remaining 3,000 were inching closer to that level.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, reinforcements from the Draco Armed Services Branch finally arrived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian declared, "Let's head back to Newport City!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Gerardo has likely stabilized the divine power uprising. If he shows up here, we're in serious trouble. He's fused with a divine corpse and gained forbidden powers; we need to avoid a confrontation with him for now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne nodded, wariness filling his gaze at the thought of Gerardo's strength. He quickly ordered everyone to return to Newport City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, back in Newport City, the Augustine Estate was buzzing with the news of Sebastian's return.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A wave of relief washed over them; during Sebastian's absence, they had felt utterly lost, surrounded by Rumen and Everett, with no options left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No one dared to leave the safety of the Augustine family territory, knowing that straying too far could mean death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, a chilling voice cut through the air. Rumen's domineering presence loomed overhead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wesson, are you still refusing to submit?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I told you, if you agree to our League of Divine Descent's terms and hand over 70% of the Rosmandi rare metal mines for us to exploit, we'll leave you be! We might even help you fend off the Aberrants!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Otherwise, the Augustine family might just find themselves wiped out by the Aberrants!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Rumen and Everett hovered high above, their icy glares fixed on Wesson, Miranda, and the others below, full of disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wesson scoffed, crossing his arms defiantly. "Rumen, you think you can just waltz in here and demand 70% of our rare metal mines? That's a pipe dream! If you've got the guts, go ahead and break the global agreements. Start a war if you dare!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rumen's expression darkened, his fury palpable. "Wesson, you're playing a dangerous game! Do you really think the global agreements can restrain us? You think we're afraid to go to war?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wesson shrugged, unimpressed. "Good luck with that!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fine, fine! Just you wait!" Rumen growled, his eyes burning with malice as he glared at Wesson and the others. After a moment of tense silence, he disappeared, leaving behind a heavy atmosphere charged with unspoken threats.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, they found themselves standing before an imposing mansion not far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Inside, two figures lingered in the shadows&mdash;Sin and Crimson, the top assassins of the Eityreia Organization.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Both of them looked pale, clearly injured. As soon as they spotted Rumen and his companion returning, they anxiously asked, "So, has Wesson still turned you down?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rumen's expression darkened as he nodded grimly. "Damn Augustine family. If it weren't for the Court of the Sun's 'global agreements,' I would have wiped them out ages ago! How are your injuries holding up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sin and Crimson exchanged a glance before shaking their heads in unison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We're in bad shape. We're still far from healed! The Night Witch is something else&mdash;together, we couldn't even touch her. If she'd wanted us dead, we would've been finished!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rumen felt a weight settle in his stomach at their words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sin and Crimson were no pushovers; they ranked among the top fifty on the Global Quasi-Divine Rankings and were both Class S strong warriors.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Masters of assassination and skilled in coordinated attacks, they had still fallen short against the Night Witch, left battered and broken in their wake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rumen took a deep breath, his brow furrowing in concern. "The Night Witch's strength is staggering! It seems we can't go against the Court of the Sun's 'global agreements' for now. A direct assault on the Augustine family is off the table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then we have no choice but to align ourselves with the Aberrants..."</p></div>
