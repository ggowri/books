        <h1>Chapter 1087 Pursuit</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour earlier, when the God of Star unleashed his final surge of power to cast the Level Five Light Realm, momentarily trapping all their foes, Wesson didn't hesitate&mdash;he commanded everyone to retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had lost the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staying would mean certain death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nobody wanted to be a refugee, abandoning their home, but the odds were stacked too heavily against them. They scattered in a chaotic rush from the Augustine Estate, fleeing in all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The numerous members of Ancient Families and the dozen or so superpowers opted not to join the Augustine family's flight. Instead, they split up, each racing toward their own escape routes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They understood that the Aberrants' main goal was to obliterate the Augustine family; tagging along would only amplify their danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only a few hundred members of the Lambert family chose to stand with the Augustine family, determined to fight or flee together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Together, they totaled around 30 thousand, most of whom hadn't even reached Class A.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where do we go from here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic and confusion painted the faces around Wesson. No one had a clue where safety lay. There was no real escape route in sight. They turned to Wesson, their eyes filled with desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's head to the Lostridge Mountains!" Wesson decided, his teeth gritted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Lostridge Mountains lay to the north of Newport City, a sprawling wilderness teeming with dense forests and treacherous terrain. At about 30 miles away, it wasn't too far from the Augustine Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star's Level Five Light Realm could hold the enemy at bay for a full hour&mdash;just enough time for their group to reach the mountains and find a place to hide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson had no idea how long they could stay hidden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trail left by 30 thousand fleeing souls would be impossible to cover up; it was only a matter of time before the enemy caught up to them. Adrenaline surged within him as Wesson acknowledged the dire situation&mdash;one step at a time, he'd have to navigate through the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, the remnants of the Augustine and Lambert families supported one another, setting off toward the Lostridge Mountains. Although most were below Class A, they had all trained enough to move swiftly. Under cover of night, they raced for half an hour, navigating from the southern outskirts of Newport City to the northern edge of the formidable mountain range.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Into the mountains!" Wesson commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like that, the throng of 30 thousand disappeared into the thick trees of the Lostridge Mountains. The darkness, combined with the dense foliage, masked their presence effectively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But unfortunately, their efforts were futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly after they entered the Lostridge Mountains, the Level Five Light Realm dissipated. The remaining thousands of ordinary Aberrant clones, numbering over 10 thousand, set off in pursuit of the scattered members of the Ancient Families and superpowers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, more than three hundred Class S clones, along with nearly two hundred Class S powerhouses from the League of Divine Descent and the Eityreia Organization, targeted a single goal: the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Closing in on their prey with the agility of wolves on the scent, the six hundred Class S warriors swiftly traced the escape routes of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Eityreia Organization operatives, renowned for their tracking skills and assassin prowess, followed the trails with deadly efficiency. In less than ten minutes, they descended upon the Lostridge Mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Sin gazed up at the towering peaks, a cold smile crept across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Augustine family and the Lambert family! You're all dead meat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne killed my daughter and took my beloved wife from me! I vowed to wipe out everyone connected to him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Starting with you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"May you all perish in this desolate mountain range!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gestured sharply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After them! Free hunt! I want every last one of them to die in terror! By dawn, I want them all wiped out!" Sin barked out his orders, his voice cold and unyielding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he vanished into the shadows, his figure slipping away into the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind him, nearly a hundred Class S assassins vanished as well, seamlessly entering stealth mode, racing to close the gap on the fleeing Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, nearly a hundred Class S warriors from the League of Divine Descent arrived at the scene, led by none other than Everett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furrowing his brow, Everett muttered, "These damn Eityreia Organization killers are fast! But with 30 thousand from the Augustine family's team, those killers can't possibly kill them all! We need to pick up the pace; we must eradicate the Augustine family entirely!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Augustine family's destruction means we'll gain the rights to the Rosmandi's rare metal mines!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, they plunged into the depths of the Lostridge Mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following them were over three hundred Class S clones, diving into the wilderness without so much as a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the Augustine family remained blissfully unaware of the razor-thin gap between life and death they faced, with nearly six hundred Class S predators hot on their heels. Had they known, despair would have shattered their fragile hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Currently, they had taken refuge in a narrow canyon, many too weary to fight as the remnants of their strength waned after an hour of frantic escape. Most were below Class A, fatigue settling deeply into their bones. Wesson, recognizing the need for rest, called for a halt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "All right, let's regroup. I want sentries posted around the perimeter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's just hope the enemy who's after us isn't too numerous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, out of nowhere, a chilling scream echoed from the outer perimeter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aah! Enemy attack!"</span></p></div>
