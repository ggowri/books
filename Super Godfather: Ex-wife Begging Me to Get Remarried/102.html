        <h1>Chapter 102 Inquiry</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With anticipation, Osborne got into Clarissa's car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver was a middle-aged man, a member of the Personal Guards, also nurtured by the Radcliffe family, who hadn't betrayed them alongside Paul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sat in the front seat, with Clarissa and Donna in the back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna turned to Osborne, earnestly saying, "Osborne, thank you for today. Without you, both Clarissa and I would have been in danger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied with a smile, "No need to thank me. It's what I should do as a bodyguard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna shook her head. "No, what you did goes far beyond what a normal bodyguard would do. Rest assured, the Radcliffe family doesn't forget favors, and we won't mistreat you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I have many doubts. How did you know that Paul had betrayed the Radcliffe family? And how did you know that Paul was planning to poison me? Osborne, can you enlighten me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna's tone was very polite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, saying, "In fact, I started suspecting Paul the first time I met him. During that attack, while Paul and I were protecting Ms. Radcliffe together, I noticed that as the head of the bodyguard team, he wasn't fulfilling his duties properly. Instead, it seemed like he was intentionally putting Ms. Radcliffe in danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I told you all back then that I suspected him of being a spy, but unfortunately, none of you believed me. You even laughed, saying anyone could be a spy except him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Paul shrugged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna suddenly looked embarrassed, as those were the words she had said to Osborne, and now the truth was right in front of her, almost like a slap in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she didn't interrupt Osborne, gesturing for him to continue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After that, I started investigating Paul. I found out he was secretly in contact with a gang leader from Mayby City. He seemed to be hiding something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I recognized that gang leader, Davy. He's the leader of Maelstrom. During my break, I managed to find him and extract some secrets..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly recounted the events, only concealing his abilities and his relationship with Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he took out his phone and played a video.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The video showed Davy confessing some secrets after ingesting truth serum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For example, why did Paul betray the Radcliffe family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did the first three attacks fail?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the Aberrants' plan to poison Donna through Paul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the video ended, Donna's expression turned extremely grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paul! Bastard!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's an orphan, raised and taught by the Radcliffe family. If it weren't for the Radcliffe family, he would have died long ago! And just because he wanted to become a metahuman, wanted money, he betrayed the Radcliffe family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna's eyes were filled with resentment and a deep sense of worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As an ancient family, the Radcliffe family had existed for hundreds of years. They naturally knew about the Aberrants, who controlled the underground world of Rosmandi a hundred years ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of the Aberrants was far beyond what the Radcliffe family could compare to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if ten ancient families joined forces, they wouldn't be able to match the former strength of the Aberrants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, the Aberrants were defeated by Godfather decades ago, fleeing Rosmandi. Even if they had partially recovered their strength, they definitely weren't as formidable as they once were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did the Aberrants want to kill Clarissa?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna furrowed her brow tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, "That's also something I'm puzzled about. You'll have to ask yourselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna shook her head, saying, "No matter what, this time, we owe you a lot. If you hadn't discovered Paul's betrayal in advance, uncovered the Aberrants' conspiracy, and made preparations, Clarissa and I would have been doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, how much did it cost to bring in the reinforcements? Don't worry, this expense should be covered by the Radcliffe family. You won't have to pay for it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Donna's words, Osborne's eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hiring </span><span>Isa</span><span> once wasn't cheap, so Osborne was reluctant to part with that much. But since Donna was willing to cover the cost, he wasn't about to object.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"20 million," Osborne announced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna's eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked a bit uncomfortable. "Well, it is quite steep, but that's what she demands. I don't have much say in it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna cleared her throat and said, "No, it's not that I think it's too expensive. Quite the opposite - it's a steal! The person you hired took down a Class C+ wind-controlling metahuman with one punch. She's clearly at least Class B or higher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To have someone of her caliber willing to work for just 20 million? She must be more than a friend to you. No, it must be more than just friendship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even at a discounted rate, that's ridiculously low."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Donna spoke, Clarissa turned to Osborne with an intrigued expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "20 million is considered cheap for </span><span>Isa</span><span>'s services?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even at a friends-and-family discount, it shouldn't be this low?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I genuinely didn't know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't sure how to explain and simply said, "Yeah, she is my friend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna then continued with the conversation, but Osborne's anxiety grew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna still hadn't mentioned anything about promoting him to replace Paul as Clarissa's head bodyguard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, as they approached the Radcliffe Manor, Donna turned to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I want to offer you a promotion."</span></p></div>
