        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling his vision was blurry only for a second, Wallace couldn't even react to Osborne's attack before he was punched away while vomiting blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fell heavily to the ground, examining his chest in pain, only to find at least five bones were broken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took a lot of effort for him to sit up. Wallace stared at Osborne a few inches away with dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he knew he couldn't compete with Osborne, the enormous disparity between their power dragged Wallace into the abyss of terror because he even failed to hold on even one round.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, the only reason Wallace could still breathe was that Osborne had no intention of ending his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear overwhelmed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt a little regretful that if he had known the inevitable defeat at the beginning and left with Osborne, his bones wouldn't have been fractured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, can you come with me?" Osborne sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wallace clenched his teeth and didn't say a word, but he stood up obediently and prepared to follow his order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne smiled faintly, "You don't want to talk? It seems you are still resisting my request. It doesn't matter, since I will beat you until you are willing to accept it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, he approached Wallace within half a second again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! Don't hit me. I'll go with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Wallace's twisted face and begging for mercy, Osborne still punched him, making Wallace stumble and vomit more blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at him with a sneer, Osborne said calmly, "Sorry, you spoke too slowly to let me stop in time. Remember to admit you are a loser faster next time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wallace's face was distorted with horror, partly due to pain and partly due to rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Considering Osborne's power, he could stop the moment Wallace surrendered, but Osborne just wanted to teach him a lesson by deliberately not withdrawing the fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wallace was furious but had no guts to protest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood up with difficulty and said with his teeth clenched, "I'll go with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very good." Osborne shrugged and said to Clarissa and Autumn, "Come one, let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hurried to catch up with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When passing by Gavin, Osborne suddenly crushed his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within a blink of an eye, Gavin died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A useless piece of trash should vanish like that!" Osborne commented scornfully after killing Gavin like killing an ant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wallace gasped and looked at Osborne in horror and tremble, but he dared not say anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne fixed his eyes on Wallace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wallace was suddenly alert. "Osborne, why are you staring at me? My family will definitely give you enough compensation! I am still useful to you, so don't do anything stupid!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled calmly, "What are you talking about? I won't kill you for the time being. I just think it's better to knock you out first in case you will cause any trouble to me later!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Osborne slapped Wallace on the back of the head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a groan, Wallace lost consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Osborne grab Wallace's collar, carry Clarissa and Autumn, and soon return to the Augustine Estate through Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Clarissa, can you take care of Autumn now? I have to meet Isaac."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne brought the unconscious Wallace to the conference room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sight of Wallace, Isaac couldn't help but be astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After learning what had happened from Osborne, the shock on Isaac's face changed into anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never thought that the Luther family would secretly support an underground gang like the Hummingbird Gang and allow them to mess around! Osborne, you did a good job. The people in the Hummingbird Gang deserved it!" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After cursing them angrily, Isaac asked, "What are you going to do to him? Do you really want to exchange him for the compensation of the Luther family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, "No way! I don't need money. The reason I captured Wallace was just to lure the Luther family into taking action!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Osborne quickly told Isaac his plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac frowned. "But it will put you under heavy pressure! A single mistake will lead to a miserable result. I can't agree to let you take such a huge risk!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said calmly, "Don't worry, Isaac. I am not alone. Clarissa will also help me. You just need to pass the message to the Luther family. In addition, I will also look for a powerful helper. He will at least guarantee my safety."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's your powerful helper?" Isaac asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, "Bryce Clarkson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne left the meeting room, he went to find his nominal sister, Yulissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa was with Kendra when Osborne found her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person Osborne was really looking for was Kendra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her face, Osborne looked a little ashamed. He had promised Bryce that he would take good care of Kendra and treat her like his little sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne was too busy to even meet Kendra during this period.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Kendra actually became good friends with Yulissa. They were holding </span><span>hands in an intimate way, which made Osborne feel at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what brings you here?" When Yulissa saw Osborne, she quickly ran over and looked at him with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne patted her head and looked at Kendra. "I'm here for her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Yulissa pouted and said, "So you're not here to see me? Kendra, Osborne needs to see you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra walked over and greeted him with a smile, "Hi, Osborne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded and said with a smile, "Kendra, I need you to do me a favor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra was puzzled. "What do you want me to do? Just tell me. I have been bothering you and your family for a while. Just tell me what I can do for your kindness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled contentedly when he heard that. "Kendra, don't go back on your word."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for Kendra to answer, Osborne continued, "Kendra, I hope you can contact Bryce and ask him to come and help me this time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, Kendra was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she turned around and ran away.</span></p></div>
