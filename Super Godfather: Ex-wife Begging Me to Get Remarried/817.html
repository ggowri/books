        <h1>Chapter 817 The Impassable Chasm</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sharp crack of power cleaved the air!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the Axe of Strength descended with brutal force, Osborne's face contorted with the strain, the void around him seeming to splinter at the impact.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was a frozen realm, fracturing under the might of his blow.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Axe of Strength, its blade stretching hundreds of yards, burst forth from the weapon, tracing a deadly arc through the sky as it descended mercilessly towards Marvin, who stood hundreds of yards away.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin sensed the formidable power of the axe, and a look of astonishment washed over his features.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I never imagined you'd reach such heights! With this move alone, my son's loss to you is almost justified!" he exclaimed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, his tone hardened, "But this won't work on me!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Shatter!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a cold sneer, Marvin unleashed a devastating force from his core, a shockwave that met Osborne's dark axe blade with a thunderous boom.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The blade of the axe started to fracture, and the mightiest strike Osborne had summoned with every ounce of his strength began to unravel, accompanied by a sound akin to the rumble of muffled thunder.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, it did not fully disintegrate. It crashed to the ground, carving a massive trench and raising a cloud of debris and dust.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A shockwave erupted and instantaneously swept away the cloud of dust, unveiling the silhouette of Marvin standing amidst the chaos.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, his face was cast in an extremely somber shadow, and a faint trace of blood marked his forehead as though etched by the finest edge of a blade.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A thin line of blood trickled down his forehead.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He extended a hand, touching the wound on his forehead. When he saw the blood that stained his fingertips, his expression chilled further into a mask of icy rage.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You dared to injure me?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin hissed through gritted teeth. "Very well! I admit I underestimated you. You have the power to draw my blood. When you're fully grown, perhaps you'll contend for the top ten on the Godson Rankings!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But you won't get the chance.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"People like you should be extinguished before they can rise."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Marvin struck.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From a hundred yards away, his palm thrust forward, a terrifying force traversing the space between them.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's eyes widened in shock, but it was too late to react.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, the swallow shield had positioned itself before him. At that critical moment, it radiated a vibrant green light and expanded instantaneously to an immense size, effectively barricading against Marvin's onslaught.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, a residual force of formidable power pierced through, striking Osborne's body with unyielding impact.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Boom!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was catapulted through the air, crashing heavily into the mountain wall, which gave way to form a cavernous indent. Blood erupted from his mouth as a wave of dizziness overwhelmed his senses.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Incredible strength!" he gasped.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even with the swallow shield absorbing 80% of Marvin's power, I'm gravely injured!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne stood, facing Marvin with a newfound gravity.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this juncture, an immense force surged from the swallow shield. This was the shield's unique trait; it absorbed the energy from the adversary's assault, now harnessed and redirected by Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With this power, Osborne felt his own strength swell to terrifying levels. Clutching his axe, he raised it high once more. "Taste my axe again!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Boom!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The fearsome blade exploded forth.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin let out a disdainful snort, "The same tricks again? Do you believe they'll work on me? Break!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He launched a punch.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This time, though the axe blade was even more fearsome, it was shattered by Marvin's counter before it could even descend, leaving him unscathed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's heart sank.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How can I fight against him?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He felt the chasm between them, vast and insurmountable. Despite his breakthrough to Class AAA, he was no match for an S-class Supreme Overlord warrior like Marvin.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His divine artifacts, though powerful, could not breach Marvin's defenses.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin stood like an indomitable mountain, unyielding and impervious to all assaults.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your swallow shield won't save you," Marvin declared.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He struck once more, his palm descending upon Osborne. The swallow shield once again absorbed the brunt of the force, yet what remained was still beyond what Osborne could endure.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bang!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was flung back. More blood painted the air.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now, I'll break every bone in your body, piece by piece," Marvin said coldly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without granting Osborne the slightest opportunity to retaliate, Marvin assaulted him relentlessly. Each strike forced Osborne to cough up blood. The sound of his bones creaking under the strain echoed ominously.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was reduced to a wretched state, and the luminescence of the swallow shield began to wane, signaling its impending failure.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "It was unstoppable.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Truly unstoppable!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He spewed blood in a frenzy, staring at the dimming shield. He knew all too well that once the shield's protection faded, Marvin would likely end his life in short order.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He gritted his teeth and sheathed the Axe of Strength.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Marvin, do you dare face another attack from me? I have one more move, the very move I used to kill your son! You, an S-class Supreme Overlord warrior, surely won't shy away, will you?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin smiled malevolently at his words.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was aware that Osborne was intentionally goading him, but it mattered little to him. As an S-class Supreme Overlord, he regarded Osborne with such disdain that he didn't take him seriously in the slightest.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Show me your tricks. Let's see what you've got left."</p></div>
