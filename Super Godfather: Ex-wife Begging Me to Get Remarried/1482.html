        <h1>Chapter 1481 Invite</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Soon, we will all take our own lives!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren's declaration sent a ripple of shock through the crowd, his words carrying a weight of tragic heroism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't want to be a burden to Spark of Blaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They would rather choose death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Darren, then scanned the faces of the over five thousand gathered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take your own lives? I can't accept that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want every one of you to join Spark of Blaze! Right now, Spark of Blaze is weak, but with true warriors like you on our side, we can strengthen our position and stand tall!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words left Darren momentarily speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've said it before&mdash;we're done for. We're not the elite soldiers we used to be..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled gently and said, "Not so fast! Just because you think you've lost your strength doesn't mean you're worthless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your experiences are a treasure that can help Spark of Blaze! Sure, taking the easy way out might seem noble, but is that really what you want? Don't you want to see the Human Community improve?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you want to witness us reclaim Celestara? Do you really just want to die without a fight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you want to avenge the Pioneers of Starlight? To avenge your fallen comrades?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's words hit like a hammer, striking Darren and the others in the chest with force. Their breathing quickened, and indignation ignited in their eyes, reddening with suppressed emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, they felt wronged!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, they wanted vengeance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They longed to see the Human Community reclaim its rule over Celestara, to defeat Lord Malevolence and topple the arrogant warriors of the other races.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That had once been their ultimate goal&mdash;they would risk anything for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, they were broken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What could they do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes shimmered with a desperate rage as Osborne's words rekindled their sense of injustice and desire to fight. But what good was that feeling?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were wrecks now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty and the others watched Osborne with uncertainty, unsure of his motivations for rallying these broken individuals, yet they didn't intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their respect for the captives from the West Zone was clear; it was because of their battles and sacrifices that the Human Community still held onto the West Zone, preventing Celestara from entirely falling into Lord Malevolence's grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as these warriors from the West Zone stood, hope remained for the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many among them dreamed of joining a resistance group in the West Zone, where they could at least fight for their dignity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the road to the West Zone was fraught with danger, and the journey was long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dark Deity Legion would greet any escapees with relentless pursuit; only a few ever made it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But respect aside, these people were broken now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They simply couldn't understand why Osborne was so keen to enlist those captives in Spark of Blaze. Hadn't he already stated that everyone had to follow his orders? If they could voice their doubts, they surely would have.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bringing these broken souls into Spark of Blaze would only weigh it down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I invite you once more to join Spark of Blaze! Even though your divine power essences have been shattered, even though your bodies are broken&mdash;you have lost eyes, limbs&mdash;but I still want you to join us. Perhaps one day, I can help heal you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne offered them a glimmer of hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heal us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren and the others murmured in disbelief, sharing a bitter laugh. They knew their conditions too well&mdash;only the Goddess of Life could work miracles like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, the Goddess of Life had perished in her battle against Lord Malevolence a thousand years ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, their injuries could never truly heal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, as Osborne continued to extend his invitation, Darren's expression began to soften. If there was a chance to live with dignity, to prove their worth, who would willingly choose death?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fixed his gaze on Osborne, his teeth clenched. "Are you really sincere about wanting us to join? Don't you worry that we might just drag you down?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded earnestly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I genuinely want you to join us! I don't see you as useless at all, nor do I think you'll be a burden. In fact, I believe that you all will shine brightly again very soon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren felt a surge of emotion at Osborne's words, his cheeks flushing with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! I'll do it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you believe we still have something to offer, then this group of 'broken' warriors will temporarily join Spark of Blaze and fight for it one more time! Even if we're just cannon fodder, as long as it benefits the Human Community, we're all in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And if there comes a day when you think we're no longer useful, just say the word&mdash;we won't hold you back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Darren spoke, over five thousand heads nodded vigorously in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne watched as the despairing, lifeless eyes of the crowd began to flicker with a glimmer of hope.</span></p></div>
