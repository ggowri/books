        <h1>Chapter 527 Heading to Newport City</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Osborne returned to the conference room, the heated debate was still in full swing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We are members of the Wise Order. To show our respect for the Godfather, we should personally go to Newport City to celebrate his birthday! Absolutely, we must go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We are the younger generation of this family. It's our turn to make a mark. We should go to Newport City and show the Augustine family's main bloodline what the Augustine family in Dampston has to offer! We have to go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, you're too young. There will be other opportunities for you. You lack the poise necessary for such an occasion. What if you offend the Godfather? It's best if we go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But we're full of energy, and we want to be there!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their arguments, loud and passionate, centered around whether the Wise Order members or the younger generation should attend the Godfather's birthday celebration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The debate showed no signs of abating until Osborne stepped inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clearing his throat, he commanded the room's attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's let Osborne decide!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes! It's up to Osborne! Whoever he wants to bring along, that's how it should be!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All eyes turned to Osborne, who felt a twinge of exasperation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If everyone wants to go, let's make it a group event! The Augustine family's main bloodline hasn't limited the number of attendees, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His comment caught everyone off guard. They exchanged glances, momentarily speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, while it's true that the main bloodline hasn't set a limit, sending too many people might come off as lacking decorum. We wouldn't want to draw disdain," Brian remarked, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isaac nodded in agreement. "Exactly. We can't send too many representatives. Besides, we just took over the Paltrow family, the Walker family, and the Luther family's interests. We need people here in Dampston to ensure our hold is solid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How about this? I'll stay behind to oversee things. The Wise Order should leave at least half of our members here. As for the younger generation, if they want to join, they're welcome to go along.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Seeing the world is crucial for the youth."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once Isaac made his case, the members of the Wise Order, though a bit disappointed, didn't put up a fight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A few stepped forward voluntarily, offering to remain in Dampston.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At last, a delegation of twenty-five would head to Newport City for the Godfather's birthday festivities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This would include five from the Wise Order and primarily younger members.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian, as the acting head of the family, opted to stay behind, while the likes of Nathan, Kaden, Queenie, and Yulissa&mdash;whom Osborne knew well&mdash;would join him in the delegation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alongside them, Osborne planned to take Anastasia, Zoe, and Kendra, totaling twenty-eight in the group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now, we should discuss what gift to bring for the Godfather's birthday," Isaac said, glancing around the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The group fell into contemplative silence, each person pondering the significance of this occasion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Godfather's eighty years of life wouldn't simply pass without gifts. All branch bloodlines of the Augustine family would be there, presenting their tokens of respect, and they certainly couldn't afford to come up short.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, the gifts had to be of substantial value.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Otherwise, they might end up being ridiculed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You younger folks need to brainstorm ideas for the best gift for the Godfather!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The young members looked at each other blankly, each unwilling to tread into such delicate waters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their gazes inevitably landed on Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, choosing a worthy gift was no minor task; it could reflect poorly on the entire family if they misstepped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne rubbed his chin, deep in thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He then said, "Alright, let me take care of the gift situation. We'll head to Newport City tomorrow and scope things out before making a decision."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sounds like a plan!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Absolutely!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We'll get started right away!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, the conference room finally settled into a rare stillness, leaving just Isaac and Osborne behind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isaac gazed intently at Osborne and sighed, "Will you be coming back from Newport City this time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was momentarily taken aback by the question, but he nodded firmly, "I will return."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, he planned to come back&mdash;Clarissa was still in a hidden safehouse nearby, working on her breakthrough. After attending the Godfather's birthday party, he would naturally have to come back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Osborne wasn't sure how long he would remain the heir to the Augustine family of Dampston.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His true identity might be exposed at any moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isaac then asked, "Who do you think should be the heir to the Augustine family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne knew Isaac was preparing for his departure in advance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He began to consider the options.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In his mind, he saw the faces of Nathan, Kaden, Queenie, and Yulissa&mdash;the four most promising young members of the Augustine family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, none of them seemed entirely ready to take on the role of heir.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nathan was too brash and hasty, often speaking before thinking things through. Though he had been a reliable aide to Osborne lately, he still needed to mature significantly to handle the family's responsibilities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kaden was overly honest and reticent, often struggling to speak up. His qualities were admirable, but he wasn't suited for the weighty role of a family leader.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie was a more viable option, showing both skill and a generally good demeanor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, her behavior outside Osborne's presence was more like that of an immature troublemaker, which made her an unreliable choice for leading the family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for Yulissa, she was simply too young and not yet powerful enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne rubbed his temples in frustration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Never mind, I get what you're saying. They're all lacking in some way. Please mentor them closely during this time and help them grow as quickly as possible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Prepare everything," Isaac said, dismissing the topic with a wave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next day arrived swiftly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The twenty-eight members preparing for their journey to Newport City were all set. The Augustine family had chartered a private jet to transport them to their destination.</p></div>
