        <h1>Chapter 968 The Augustine Family Crisis</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wesson and the members of the Augustine family were overjoyed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The mysterious powerhouse who had been hiding within their ranks had finally made a move!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A blinding white light, brimming with terrifying power, surged toward Rumen and Everett. But suddenly, two eerie figures appeared, stepping in front of the oncoming light.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their hands erupted with dark energy as they launched a counterattack against the white glow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A formidable shockwave erupted, sending the two figures flying backward, yet the white light dissipated completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hahaha, that wasn't so impressive after all." Sin and Crimson sneered, their eyes narrowing as they fixed their gaze on Challenge Peak, seemingly piercing through it to the dungeon where the God of Star was in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">God of Star, deep in the shadows, frowned tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Another pair of top-tier Class S Lesser Gods? This could get tricky. My injuries haven't fully healed yet. I could handle two top-tier Lesser Gods, but four? That's pushing it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He glanced at Clarissa nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After days of his guidance, she was on the verge of a breakthrough and would soon ascend to Class AAA.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at her, God of Star felt a wave of astonishment wash over him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I thought she'd need a whole week to reach Class AAA, but here she is, ready to break through in less than four days! What a prodigy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But right now, my priority is to fend off these four top-tier Class S Lesser Gods. I promised Osborne I'd protect the Augustine family, and I must keep that promise."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, God of Star unleashed another wave of power, sending an even more terrifying beam of white light hurtling toward Sin and Crimson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sin and Crimson grunted in unison. "Let's hit them together!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Rumen, Everett, we'll hold off this mysterious powerhouse. You two focus on cleaning up the rest and getting out of here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rumen and Everett nodded, their expressions cold and determined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry, we'll wipe them out in no time!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, a chilling, murderous intent ignited in their eyes. The power surging from them intensified as they locked onto Wesson and the elders of the Augustine family, wearing cruel smiles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Kill!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They charged forward once more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Previously, they had held back against God of Star, but now that his attack had been completely neutralized by Sin and Crimson, they felt no further hesitation. With their full might unleashed, the already struggling Wesson and the Augustine family elders were now completely overmatched.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One by one, the weaker elders of the Augustine family began to fall, and casualties mounted rapidly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this rate, it wouldn't be long before they were all wiped out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, hundreds of miles away, aboard a transport plane, panic erupted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What?! The Augustine family is under attack!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you telling me that Rumen and Everett from the League of Divine Descent, along with Sin and Crimson from the Eityreia Organization, are attacking the Augustine family? Four top-notch Class S fighters all at once?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian and Osborne shot to their feet, their faces pale with dread.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They were en route back to Newport City, bringing all members of the Blood Demon and Draco Armed Services Branch with them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They would arrive in less than half an hour, but now they were receiving urgent distress signals from the Augustine family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grandpa, we need to hurry!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne wasted no time. He ripped open a rift in space. Though the transport plane was fast, it paled in comparison to his interdimensional travel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Augustine family was in grave danger, and they had to get back&mdash;fast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian didn't hesitate for a moment as he stepped into the dimensional rift alongside Osborne. In the blink of an eye, they appeared 80 miles away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After three interdimensional travels, they finally made their way back to the Augustine Estate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The battle was still raging.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">God of Star, still recovering from injuries, struggled to contain the power of Sin and Crimson, two peak Class S fighters. Despite giving it his all, he had no capacity to deal with Rumen and Everett, who were wreaking havoc with relentless force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wesson, Miranda, and the other two Class S warriors, alongside dozens of Class AAA elders from the Augustine family, found themselves overwhelmed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One by one, elders fell to Rumen and Everett's brutal assault.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even the younger generation, including Emma and Matthew, were in dire straits, battered and bruised from the ferocity of the ongoing conflict.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne had just arrived on the scene when he saw Everett lunging toward Emma.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Look at you, little girl. You've got some serious skills for someone so young. You're stronger than most of the elders in the Augustine family. If you keep growing like this, you'll become a real problem!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll take you out first!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Time to die!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Everett unleashed a devastating attack aimed directly at Emma. Already injured, she was sent flying by the sheer force of the blast, her condition deteriorating rapidly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Had it not been for the elders of the Augustine family who hurled themselves in front of her, taking the blows meant for her, she would have met her end right then and there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But even that sacrifice seemed insufficient to halt Everett.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ha! Die!" Everett cackled as he dispatched two more Augustine elders without a second thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a flash, he reappeared near Emma and unleashed a terrifying beam of energy that shot toward her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Emma was too battered to evade the attack, and there was no one left to shield her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A chilling aura of death surrounded her, leaving her with a crushing sense of despair.</p></div>
