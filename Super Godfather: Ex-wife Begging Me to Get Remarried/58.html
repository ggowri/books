        <h1>Chapter 58 Holy Light Healing</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa added, &ldquo;Moreover, once they transform into werewolves, their minds will whirl even more, leaving behind only the instinct to kill like wild beasts. They won&rsquo;t fear death and won&rsquo;t know how to retreat.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne couldn&rsquo;t help but smile bitterly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Hearts?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What a weakness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The heart was the crucial point for every living being; the key was whether he could hit it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But now, Osborne had no way out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The first werewolf had already closed the distance to within ten feet in front of him. It kicked the ground fiercely with its hands and feet, launching itself ferociously toward him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Regarding Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguard captain, Paul, Osborne had no information about his whereabouts and couldn&rsquo;t rely on him in any way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; Osborne shouted while attacking instantly. The sharp alloy dagger swiftly stabbed at the werewolf.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that moment, his Satan&rsquo;s Eye was activated to its fullest extent. The werewolf&rsquo;s lightning-fast speed appeared to slow down in his vision, allowing him to pinpoint its weakness soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Its heart!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne promptly sidestepped, dodging the werewolf&rsquo;s attack, and thrust out with the dagger in his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It plunged into the werewolf&rsquo;s body, driving deep into its heart and leaving a gruesome wound nearly dozens of inches long, almost cleaving the werewolf in two.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Its scarlet eyes quickly dimmed before it fell to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was dead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne eliminated a werewolf in a single strike.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa&rsquo;s beautiful eyes shone brightly as she looked at him in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But only he was aware that this was far from a moment of joy. While it appeared he had effortlessly slain a werewolf, he had actually expended all his strength in doing so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The sharp alloy dagger encountered significant resistance as it sliced through the werewolf&rsquo;s body, leaving two noticeable gaps on its blade.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What a strong defense.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s expression was grave. Had he not recently trained in The Breath of Celestial, which greatly enhanced his strength, it would have been challenging for him even to scratch the werewolf&rsquo;s skin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even now, his arms were sore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had exerted too much force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, he refrained from saying anything to avoid worrying Clarissa. Instead, he focused on the second werewolf, then the third, and even the fourth, all of whom swiftly lunged at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that moment, Osborne had no choice but to fight hard. He would never allow these werewolves to hurt Clarissa. Otherwise, he would fail the test of heirship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The dagger clashed against their claws, producing a metallic ringing. With each collision, small gaps began to appear on its blade.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Soon, Osborne was in danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The nine werewolves attacked in unison, displaying the same tacit cooperation as a pack of wolves, putting immense pressure on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Shortly after, countless gruesome wounds marred his body, each one ghastly with flesh torn outward and blood spurting forth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was no match for them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After all, Osborne&rsquo;s practice time with the Breath of the Celestial had been too brief. While his physical abilities had indeed improved significantly, matching those of the werewolves, he still fell short compared to their relentless endurance, incredible speed, powerful attacks, and formidable defenses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Most importantly, there were too many werewolves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His Satan&rsquo;s Eye could slow down the werewolves and reveal their weaknesses, allowing him to handle only one of them with ease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, despite identifying the flaw, the sheer difference in numbers left him unable to capitalize on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Killing a werewolf would injure him seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Unless Osborne was willing to risk his life to take down the werewolves, there was little he could do against them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He frowned tightly, thinking of a solution.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The only option seemed to be to run away with Clarissa, though they might not successfully escape.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Why hasn&rsquo;t Paul come yet?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was seething with anger, but with no time to search for Paul, he struggled to confront the werewolves alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The wounds on his body increased.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even Osborne himself felt he couldn&rsquo;t endure any longer. If he persisted, his severe injuries would end his life right there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that moment, something strange happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, a beam of holy white light descended from the sky and enveloped Osborne&rsquo;s body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, warmth spread throughout his entire body, accompanied by a surge of vitality that erupted like a volcanic burst.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His grotesque wounds healed rapidly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Most of them were gone in the blink of an eye, with even the scars vanishing completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was shocked instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He immediately glanced back at Clarissa, only to find her wearing a solemn expression, resembling a saint, her slender hands gesturing with purpose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The next moment, another holy white light fell on Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had fully recovered from his injuries.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With a slightly pale face, Clarissa shouted, &ldquo;Osborne, this is my superpower, Holy Light Healing. You can attack boldly. As long as I&rsquo;m alive, you won&rsquo;t die.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa&rsquo;s voice brimmed with confidence. She stood there like a radiant saint, an angel without wings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was dumbfounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa&rsquo;s superpower could heal him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Holy Light Healing?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Did she have two superpowers?</p></div>
