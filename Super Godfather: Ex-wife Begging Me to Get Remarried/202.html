        <h1>Chapter 202 Three Elemental Powers</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin was a Class B martial artist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was an orphan, taken in by the Godfather and sent to the Draco Group's training camp for grueling training. Later, he was discovered to have innate strength, making him a good candidate for martial arts, and he was taken as a disciple by a powerful martial artist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since then, he has lived up to expectations, becoming a Class B martial artist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His strength was greater than that of most Class B martial artists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at the same time level, martial artists were generally not as strong as metahumans. The strength of martial artists lay in their power, speed, and formidable physical defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Metahumans, on the other hand, had more varied abilities due to their use of different extra energies, making them more unpredictable and difficult to deal with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For example, Apollo was a wind metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He integrated wind energy into his combat techniques, with terrifying tornadoes constantly swirling around him, making them his most fearsome weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every punch he threw carried the power of a Wind Tornado, and even though Valentin had innate strength, he was at a disadvantage when facing Apollo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo's Wind Tornado also served as his best defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin's combat skills were strong, and he was able to hit Apollo, but he couldn't break through his Wind Tornado. Instead, his own fists were cut by the sharp wind blades, leaving fine wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in terms of speed, Valentin was no match for Apollo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Wind Tornado carried Apollo's body, making him as elusive as a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, just from the initial exchange, Valentin was at a clear disadvantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The enraged Apollo wanted nothing more than to wipe out Valentin and his men. He no longer held back, putting all his strength into every move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin struggled to defend himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin might be at a disadvantage, but his men had the upper hand. Apollo's men were now reduced to seven, a third of Valentin's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Apollo's men were individually stronger, they weren't overwhelmingly so. Facing three times their number, they didn't have the advantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, there were snipers from Valentin's team in the distance. The snipers occasionally shot, forcing Apollo's men to constantly shift positions to avoid being sniped, unable to focus entirely on the fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Apollo's men were ultimately stronger, making it difficult for Valentin's men to kill them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew that the outcome of this duel would be determined by the result of Valentin and Apollo's battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Apollo could quickly resolve Valentin, no one on the battlefield would be able to stop his slaughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo was aware of this, so his attacks became even fiercer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one noticed Osborne quietly bypassing the battlefield and arriving behind Apollo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked down with a smile at the few severely injured and unconscious individuals, among whom was a water metahuman and an earth metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were Osborne's targets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally, I can devour elemental essence again. How much stronger will I become after absorbing theirs?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Valentin might not last long. I have to be quick."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't waste time. His Satan's Eye burst with a light that enveloped the earth metahuman's body. Osborne felt a thick force emanating from the man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That force came from the man's essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This earth essence was closely integrated with the man's body, and ordinary methods would struggle to separate it from his flesh. But under the ocular energy of Satan's Eye, the earth essence had no resistance and was gradually separated, merging into Osborne's left eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, Osborne felt a tingling sensation spread throughout his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Osborne felt the ground beneath his feet come alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These are the earth elements?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up. He felt that with his willpower, he could control the soil beneath his feet, changing its form at will.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Earth Wall."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne muttered, and immediately in front of him, countless yellowish earth elements gathered and condensed into a thick and tight wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Earth Spikes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne muttered again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thirty feet away, the calm ground suddenly cracked, and a sharp spike broke through the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Earth Armor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was instantly covered with earth elements, which formed a powerful earth elemental armor around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's cool!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna was also an earth metahuman. She once fought Raymond three times. Relying on her strong defense, she didn't let Raymond gain any advantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Osborne had also mastered the use of earth elements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Osborne felt that he could exert greater and more agile power than Donna. The speed at which the earth's elements gather was also faster than when Donna controlled them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he were to fight Donna using only earth elements, he believed he could defeat her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next is the water element."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at the water metahuman, took a deep breath, and began to devour again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Osborne's left eye also devoured the man's water essence, and Osborne successfully grasped the power of the water element."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, he had mastered three elemental powers, lightning, earth, and water, without feeling any pressure.</span></p></div>
