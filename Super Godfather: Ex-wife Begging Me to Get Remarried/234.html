        <h1>Chapter 234 The Backlash of the Fate Power</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's cheeks flushed a deep crimson as she listened to Osborne talk about earning more money to marry her. A sweet thrill coursed through her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She declared, her voice brimming with determination, "Osborne, I want to go with you! I'm stronger now; I can help you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was true that Clarissa had gained significant power&mdash;so much so that even he felt uncertain about facing her in a fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she accompanied him, their chances of success would increase dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, despite the tempting offer, he shook his head firmly. "No way! First off, you still lack battle experience. You might be powerful, but you need to get used to your new abilities. Second, I don't want you to expose your strength just yet. We should save that shock for the right moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And third, I have my own escape plans. Even if things go south, I know how to get out unscathed. But if I'm bringing you along, I won't be able to use those tactics effectively."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa bit her lip, torn between wanting to support him and understanding his concerns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, she nodded, recognizing the truth in his words. Her power was impressive, but without the experience to back it up, it could be a liability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just promise me you'll be careful! I don't care about how much money you make or what you own. I just want you to be safe," Clarissa urged, her eyes filled with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it!" Osborne replied, pulling her into a warm embrace before heading out of the Radcliffe Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, a day had passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the day Osborne had arranged to meet with the Chevalier family to sign the transfer agreement for the diamond mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, an earth-shattering piece of news was sweeping through the upper class of </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> society.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion, the heir of the ancient Lark family, was dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had pursued Clarissa, proposing marriage after being infatuated with her, but after she turned him down, he dared to approach the Radcliffe Estate with the same request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately for him, Orion fell victim to the backlash of Clarissa's fate power and mysteriously died on the way, his body vanishing without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This shocking news spread like wildfire among the elite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one knew who had leaked the information, but it was delivered with such precision that it left everyone feeling uneasy and uncertain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion was the heir of the venerable Lark family, a prodigy who had unlocked the rare spatial power, boasting at least Class B strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could someone like him just die?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every major faction was skeptical, sending out their own people to investigate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, confirmation came from the Lark family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion was indeed missing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His convoy had been ambushed, along with thirty of his bodyguards, all of whom had vanished without a trace. The Lark family had mobilized nearly all their elite fighters and was frantically searching for Orion but to no avail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gabriel, the head of the Lark family, issued a stern warning to whoever had taken Orion. "Return him at once, or face the full wrath of the Lark family! We won't stop until we find out who did this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The news left the powerful factions of </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all understood the grim truth. Orion was most likely dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the Chevalier Estate, Derek couldn't hide his excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Orion is missing? Ha! More like he's dead," Derek scoffed with a gleam of satisfaction in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just three days ago, his son Apollo had met his end&mdash;killed by Osborne. If Orion hadn't interfered, he could have saved Apollo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, hearing about Orion's misfortune, he couldn't help but feel elated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good riddance! Orion, you scoundrel! Clarissa was supposed to be my son Apollo's fianc&eacute;e. Even if Apollo is gone, you had no right to propose to her! Looks like fate power has finally caught up with you, huh? The </span><span>Fatebearer</span><span> of the Radcliffe family isn't someone just anyone can marry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek stood </span><span>brooding,</span><span> his gaze fixed on Apollo's portrait.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apollo, you can rest easy now. Clarissa is your fianc&eacute;e, so she should be part of the Chevalier family. You may no longer have a chance to marry her, but I'll make sure she's in my grasp!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will take your place and ravage her mercilessly in bed, right here in front of your portrait. She'll scream and regret every moment of it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But before that, I will avenge you. The people who killed you will be at the diamond mine today to sign the transfer agreement. I've set up an intricate trap&mdash;if they dare show up, they'll be wiped out without a trace!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait for me. I'll bring their heads to your grave and pay my respects."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Derek turned to his subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is everything prepared at the diamond mine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, everything is set. We've stationed two hundred of our best fighters and a hundred elite mercenaries at the mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security Services mobilizes their entire force, they will meet their end if they dare enter the mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek's lips curled into a cold smirk. "Excellent. We'll head out now. I will personally collect their heads."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Derek and his team set off for the diamond mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the news of Orion being killed by the backlash of fate power was spreading rapidly through </span><span>Skyefall</span><span>. Many of the major factions, who had been sending representatives to the Radcliffe Estate to propose marriage to Clarissa, suddenly vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that the </span><span>Fatebearer</span><span> of the Radcliffe family wasn't something just anyone could handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One needed the right status, background, and talent to endure her fate power. Otherwise, it would backfire and lead to a violent death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This warning came from the most renowned seer in </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one dared to disregard it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion's death from fate power backlash?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether the news was true or not, it was enough to terrify the suitors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of them didn't have Orion's formidable background, status, or talent. If even Orion couldn't withstand the fate power backlash, daring to pursue Clarissa would be nothing short of courting death.</span></p></div>
