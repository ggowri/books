        <h1>Chapter 1164 Cain's Ghost</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who?! Who's there?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne scanned his surroundings, trying to pinpoint the source of the voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression darkened with gravity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With this level of mental strength disturbance, how is it that someone else can approach here without me sensing them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whoever this person is, their power must be extraordinary!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And they even know about the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity! Are they here to steal it from me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's instincts ramped up as he braced himself for a fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the voice sounded again. "Hmph! No need to look around so frantically, kid! I'm right here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne froze, realizing that the voice was emanating from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity... it has gained sentience?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! What kind of eyes do you have? Take a closer look. I'm not the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity; I'm merely on top of it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly shifted his gaze, and to his astonishment, he saw a faint, translucent figure perched delicately on one of the Lotus' radiant petals. A soul entity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This ghostly figure, no bigger than a thumb, was dwarfed by the vivid crimson glow of the Lotus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Osborne had missed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the details of the soul entity became clearer, Osborne gasped, recognizing the features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crimson hair flowing like blood!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sharp claws, glinting teeth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A pallid, almost ethereal complexion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're Cain, the progenitor of the Blood Clan?!" Osborne blurted out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The soul entity paused, its expression shifting in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't believe someone still knows me! Yes, I am Cain! But that's not exactly true anymore. I'm not the Blood Clan progenitor anymore; the one who possesses the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity is!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It has been stripped from my body&mdash;it no longer belongs to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Cain's eyes sparked with intense fury and hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was taken from you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's shock was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, "No wonder I got my hands on the Blood Cross; someone must have torn the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity from Cain, robbing him of his immortality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, even with just a remnant soul, the power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity would have enabled him to quickly regenerate, making him immortal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain barked with indignation, "Exactly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That damn bastard ripped my Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity away, condemning me to a mortal existence! If I hadn't acted swiftly, my fragmented soul </span><span>would have been lost&mdash;thankfully, I managed to escape into the protective embrace of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, using its power to shield me; otherwise, I would have been long dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all because I drained the life out of over 10 million people in a divine city, sucking them dry. And that bastard wanted to kill me for it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! It was all just a pretext!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He was just looking for an excuse to murder me and seize my Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity! One day, I swear I'll hunt him down and make him pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Cain radiating hostility and vengeance, Osborne's expression remained grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Ten million lives in a divine city? All die? No wonder they call him the God of Sin!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's gaze hardened as he took in Cain's expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had taken many lives himself, but only those of enemies. The thought of slaughtering innocent people, let alone wiping out millions just to quench his thirst for blood, was abhorrent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a monster before him, a true devil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a chilling demeanor, Osborne remained silent, but Cain seemed oblivious, lost in his memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! That bastard tried to rip the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity from me, desperate to fuse it into himself. But he failed! The Lotus is too powerful; not even a Deity King could pull it off successfully!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And here I am, still breathing! While I may not be able to wield the Lotus' full power, I can definitely stir up its energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he dared to force a fusion, I could provoke the Lotus' power into a frenzy! In that case, even a Deity King would be doomed, slipping into reincarnation for another life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain's expression shifted between pride and regret as he spoke, but Osborne was too stunned to retort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like he had stumbled upon a colossal secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gasped, "The one who tried to strip the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity from you was a Deity King? Which one?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain's eyes flickered with malice and hatred at the mention of the Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! Even if I told you, would you understand? But since you're so curious, I'll enlighten you. That Deity King is none other than the God of Night!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The so-called mightiest Deity King, the God of Night! He's a real piece of work. If it weren't for him, I wouldn't be in this sorry state!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen up, kid. I know you want the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. I can help you, but you have to agree to one condition!"</span></p></div>
