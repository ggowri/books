        <h1>Chapter 259 Seduction</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley ignored Ophelia's words. He left alone and came to a small castle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The main venue for the wedding was the main castle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, only those with sufficient status and background could enter the main castle. Bodyguards from major forces or some gangs were arranged in the small castle to avoid disturbing those big shots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley was here to look for someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person he was looking for was Blake Knight, the second leader of the Scarlet Gang, the largest gang in </span><span>Mayby</span><span> City!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a wealthy family, the Ashford family had unclear connections with many gangs in </span><span>Mayby</span><span> City. And they secretly supported the Scarlet Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ashford family always asked the Scarlet Gang to do those shady things that they were unwilling to do themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Wesley saw Blake in a hidden room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Ashford, your wedding is about to start. You are looking for me now. Could it be that the person you mentioned has already arrived?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley nodded with a gloomy expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! He is even more arrogant than I thought. I must teach him a lesson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, Blake couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Mr. Ashford. I have already arranged everything. It would be fine if he didn't come. But since he's here, I promise to give you a good show and make him completely humiliated. He won't be able to appear in the </span><span>upper class</span><span> society in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Blake made a phone call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The target has appeared. Start! Follow the plan, and don't let that guy find out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Blake looked at Wesley with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Ashford, you should go prepare for the wedding. You don't need to oversee such a small matter. Just leave it to me. I promise to do it properly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley frowned slightly, "Be careful. That guy is not simple. He has strong power. Otherwise, he can't become Clarissa's bodyguard. Are you sure there is no problem?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, just rest assured!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake said confidently, "No matter how strong he is, it's useless. I'm not going to beat him up. I will ruin his reputation and humiliate him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Ashford, just wait for the show."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley nodded. "I have to go prepare for the </span><span>wedding,</span><span> I'll leave this matter to you. If you do it well, I will reward you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake was excited and nodded confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley finally left. He hurried to touch up his makeup, change into his suit, and wait to appear at the wedding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Osborne had already arrived in front of the main castle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dear guest, please follow me. Your seat is over there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A waiter suddenly appeared and said to Osborne politely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't think much about it. He nodded and followed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, Osborne discovered something was wrong. The place the waiter took him to was not the main venue on the first floor of the main castle but the second floor through a remote staircase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Interesting!" Osborne murmured, "It seems that someone don't want me to attend the wedding peacefully and want to cause trouble for me. In that case, I will do as you wish and see what you want to do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and continued to follow the waiter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, an incredibly charming woman appeared from the front and walked toward Osborne with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, leave the guest to me," said the seductive woman to the waiter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The waiter quickly nodded and ran away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at the woman with interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her outfit was extremely bold. The miniskirt exposed half of her buttocks, and the sexy dress also exposed most of her huge breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most important thing was that she looked seductive all over her body. When she walked, her body twisted like a beautiful snake. She stared at </span><span>Osborne,</span><span> her eyes full of temptation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained calm, just smiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman walked up to Osborne. Osborne immediately smelled the strong perfume coming from her. He instantly felt his heart fluttering, and his desire arose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, his desire was weak. He quickly suppressed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "Interesting! She actually used poison on me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But my current physical fitness is stronger than that of an average Class B+ martial artist. The aphrodisiac poison does not work on me." He still didn't say anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman smiled, "You are Osborne, right? Let me introduce myself. My name is Ava Mariposa. I am waiting for you here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait for me? Why?" asked Osborne calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava took a step forward, her huge breasts almost touching Osborne's body. She put her rosy lips close to Osborne's ear and blew a breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To do something that both men and women love to do. Do you think I'm beautiful? Do you want to touch me? I won't resist."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava said it seductively and hugged Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Listening to such tempting words from Ava, with the help of aphrodisiac poison, if Osborne were an ordinary person, he would probably be breathing rapidly and could not wait to pounce on Ava to do whatever he wanted to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Osborne didn't feel anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was beautiful and very seductive. But in Osborne's eyes, she was far inferior to Clarissa and even to Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "How dare a woman like her wants to seduce me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered and said calmly, "I think you are so ugly that it makes me sick! So...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please get out of here now."</span></p></div>
