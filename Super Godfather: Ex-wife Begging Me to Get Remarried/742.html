        <h1>Chapter 742 The Terrifying Power</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "An average Class A master might barely be able to muster enough energy for a single activation of the super energy pistol."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's start by injecting the equivalent energy of an ordinary Class A master."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne controlled the flow of energy. Once the super energy pistol was activated, he quickly aimed at a Class A humanoid target in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Class A target was made from exceptionally sturdy materials, with a defensive capability comparable to that of an ordinary Class A warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could destroy this Class A target, it would mean the weapon was lethal enough to kill a real Class A master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Osborne was about to pull the trigger, Kash stopped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, you should test it on a Class AA target instead!" Kash quickly suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback. "Are you sure?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kash nodded firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded back and adjusted his aim towards a nearby Class AA humanoid target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled the trigger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a soft click, Osborne felt a terrifying energy compress into an energy bullet inside the super energy pistol and shoot out from the barrel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bullet moved with such speed that Osborne could barely see it. Almost instantaneously, it struck the Class AA humanoid target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy bullet pierced straight into the target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a loud explosion, half of the Class AA target's body was blown to pieces. If it were a real person, they would have been killed instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at the scene in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had only used the amount of energy equivalent to a normal Class A warrior, yet he inflicted a fatal blow on a Class AA target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Does this mean that an ordinary Class A master, using the super energy pistol at full strength, could have a chance to defeat a Class AA warrior?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Class A defeating a Class AA? That's incredible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap in power between Class A and Class AA was enormous. Even if ten Class A masters joined forces, without a special combined attack strategy, they would stand no chance against a Class AA opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, the super energy pistol could give an average Class A master the possibility of defeating a Class AA master!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amazing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was truly amazed. He realized that the power of the super energy pistol far surpassed that of a standard energy pistol, and this was just its basic power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't even injected energy at full capacity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's try injecting full power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and had Kash prepare ten Class AAA humanoid targets, lining them up in a row and spaced a hundred yards apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kash felt a bit distressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each Class AAA target was worth a fortune, with the material costs alone running into the hundreds of millions of dollars. And now, Osborne wanted to use ten of them all at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he didn't hesitate and quickly set up the targets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and once again channeled energy into the super energy pistol. This time, he went all out, pouring almost all his energy into it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt a slight weakness as a result.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Divine Bone Crystal embedded in the super energy pistol began to tremble. With so much energy activated, it condensed into a terrifying energy bullet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that the energy within the Divine Bone Crystal was essentially divine power of exceptionally high quality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, this energy bullet should more accurately be called a divine power bullet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How powerful could a divine power bullet be, charged with all my energy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne muttered to himself as he fiercely pulled the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a series of explosive sounds, the fearsome divine power bullet shot out, instantly piercing through the first Class AAA humanoid target, leaving a large bowl-sized hole in its chest as the target exploded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The divine power bullet's momentum seemed undiminished as it continued to penetrate the second, third, and fourth Class AAA targets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a series of deafening explosions, all ten Class AAA humanoid targets were pierced through by the divine power bullet. Their bodies exploded into fragmented pieces of metal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The divine power bullet finally struck the wall, blasting a three-foot-wide hole into it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight left both Osborne and Kash utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, your energy is incredibly powerful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just a Class AA, but your energy is at least twice as strong as that of an ordinary Class AAA! Oh my, it's a good thing you're only Class AA. If you were Class AAA and used the super energy pistol at full power, even these walls wouldn't be able to hold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even a Class S Supreme Overlord might get injured!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Kash's words, Osborne looked down at the super energy pistol, his eyes gleaming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "If I had this super energy pistol earlier, I wouldn't have been in such a dire situation when faced with the Class AAA Evolved Humans of the Aberrants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With it, I could have easily wiped them all out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kash, I'll take this super energy pistol!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Make more of them as quickly as you can! I want every member of my Blood Demon Organization to be equipped with a super energy pistol!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Osborne's eyes sparkled with excitement.</span></p></div>
