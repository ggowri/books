        <h1>Chapter 224 Fierce Battle</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne?" Orion's voice dripped with disbelief as he stared at the figure before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced around, ensuring there were no hidden ambushes, and a cold smirk crept across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You actually caught up to me? Lured me out here for what? Are you here to apologize and beg for mercy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion's disdain was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't fathom that Osborne had come to kill him. After all, Osborne was alone while he commanded a small army of thirty capable men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his status, he couldn't imagine Osborne would dare to challenge him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thinking of begging for mercy now? Isn't that a bit late? But since I'm a good guy at heart, if you lick my shoes clean, I might just forgive you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at him as if he were a fool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Orion, have you lost your mind? Why on earth would you think I'm here to apologize or beg for anything?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion frowned, his brow furrowing in confusion. "Isn't that why you're here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then what do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a calm smile, Osborne replied, "I'm here to kill you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, Orion was taken aback, then he burst into laughter, dismissing Osborne's words. "You? Kill me? Just you alone? That's rich! You've got to be kidding!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as quickly, his amusement faded, and his expression turned icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!" Orion barked, crossing his arms defiantly, signaling his men to attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't even consider getting his hands dirty, as if Osborne didn't warrant his direct involvement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His men surged forward, fierce and determined, ready to take Osborne down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that moment, Osborne raised a hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dark cloud loomed overhead, and terrifying bolts of lightning began to flash, crashing down with an unrelenting fury, striking every one of Orion's men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's lightning elemental essence had merged with other primal forces to become the formidable Devil's Light, but that didn't mean he couldn't still wield raw lightning power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was simply that the power of the lightning wasn't as formidable as the Devil's Light after it had been fused, which was why Osborne didn't use it much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, on a stormy night like this, the lightning's might was amplified, making it all the more terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion's subordinates, trained by the Lark family, were no slouches, but they paled in comparison to Apollo's elite Viper Squad. Most of them were only Class C or even Class D+.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the face of Osborne's unleashed power, they were utterly outmatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the lightning struck, the air filled with their pained screams. They couldn't withstand the onslaught, their bodies smoking and collapsing to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Orion remained unscathed, a dimensional rift appearing above him, swallowing the lightning aimed at him whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the storm subsided, Orion stood untouched, but his expression darkened as he surveyed the fallen bodies of his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rage boiled within him, nearly spilling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you're asking for trouble!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dimensional Devour!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion roared, swinging his hand forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massive dimensional rift, 30 feet long and resembling a gaping abyss, appeared in front of Osborne, racing toward him with terrifying speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Orion wasn't holding back. He unleashed the full force of his Class B+ metahuman abilities, intent on obliterating Osborne in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression shifted to one of alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "So, he was hiding his strength! That kind of power signature is definitely Class B+! He's younger than Apollo but somehow even stronger, and he wields that rare space power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such talent wouldn't be considered weak even in the Augustine family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's movements remained swift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most terrifying aspect of spatial power was its unpredictability&mdash;any location within the void could suddenly be the origin of a dimensional rift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dimensional rift that Orion unleashed was terrifyingly powerful&mdash;it was like tearing space itself apart. Even the toughest materials stood little chance against the slicing force of the rift; they could be sliced cleanly in two without a moment's notice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what Orion wielded was an even more formidable mastery of spatial power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dimensional Devour!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A colossal rift opened up, barreling forward with a frightening speed that resembled a gaping maw, ready to consume everything in its path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anything caught in its grasp would vanish from this world entirely, leaving no trace behind&mdash;even the remains would be wiped away as if they had never existed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with such an onslaught, most would find it nearly impossible to withstand the attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Orion's opponent was Osborne, a man well-prepared for danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flash of his eyes, Osborne activated his Satan's Eye ability, a keen instinct that warned him of impending peril. Before the dimensional rift even formed, he had sensed its threat and darted to the side just in time, narrowly avoiding the initial strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harnessing the power of the wind element, he propelled himself forward at breakneck speed, slipping past the encroaching rift with remarkable agility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion's expression darkened as he realized what had just happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? You think you can escape? You have no idea how powerful spatial power truly is! In the face of my power, you won't stand a chance! Prepare to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swung his arm again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The enormous rift surged forward with even greater speed, lunging toward Osborne. All around him, smaller dimensional rifts erupted, appearing before, behind, and to the sides of Osborne in rapid succession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These smaller rifts blocked his escape routes&mdash;if he tried to brute-force his way through, he risked getting sliced apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion was forcing him into a corner, compelling him to confront the terrifying Dimensional Devour head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, if that's how it's going to be, let's fight! Devil's Light!" Osborne bellowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a brilliant yellow glow enveloped him, radiating pure power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't just any glow&mdash;it was Level Three Devil's Light.</span></p></div>
