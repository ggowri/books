        <h1>Chapter 585 Soul Barrier</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was shocked. With the addition of the light elemental essence, he had now absorbed nine kinds of elemental essences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he couldn't sense any power inside the dungeon from his other elemental essences. The surroundings were desolately quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed as though the entire dungeon blocked all energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he could sense the power of the light elemental. The only explanation was that his light elemental essence was stronger than the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's light elemental abilities would have much more powerful effects than his other elemental abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smiled faintly. "Light is the essence of all power! In our world, all power actually comes from the light of the stars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, mastering the light elemental is crucial for you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It can attack, defend, and heal. Although its attack might not be the strongest, its defense might not be the strongest, and its healing is not the most effective, it is capable of anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Later, you might try to focus on mastering the light elemental but don't force it. It's very difficult to develop it deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In this world, there has been a God of Night, but never a God of Light."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Isa stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, speechless, watched her. "There's no God of Light in your mythology?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smiled faintly. "I'll think about it and make one up soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hesitated and then asked, "Isa, recently, through Satan's Eye, I've been absorbing star power, which seems to enhance both my body and soul. Is this also the power of light?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smiled gently. "Yes and no!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Star power is starlight, and starlight is also light! I've said before. All the power in this world comes from the light of the stars! You're able to enhance your body and soul because the star power you absorb contains that power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Usually, people can't absorb these powers directly through light. It's surprising that your Satan's Eye has this effect. It's good for you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your cultivation speed will increase significantly because of this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that you've mastered the light elemental abilities. You can absorb even more power through the starlight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm looking forward to you becoming stronger quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he heard this, Osborne's face lit up with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. I'll surpass you soon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne pulled Isa into his arms and kissed her passionately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew she was about to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As expected, when the kiss ended, Isa touched his chiseled face. "I need to leave now to add more to my mythology. Take care of yourself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you ever have an unsolvable problem, just shout my name, and I'll come to find you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a slight smile and a blink, Isa disappeared into the darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a moment of melancholy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked around at the silent dungeon again and sighed, sitting down cross-legged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed to practice the soul barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the soul barrier mastered, he could withstand the mental assaults of the dungeon. Otherwise, without it, he wouldn't last a month. Just a few days would drive him completely insane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Osborne mastered the soul barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At a thought, an invisible, transparent membrane appeared in his mind, completely protecting his soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this the soul barrier? I wonder how effective it is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a psychic assault came, and Osborne felt the soul barrier shake violently as if it might collapse, but it held firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, illusions appeared, but they were crude and couldn't deceive him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was delighted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It really works! The effect of the soul barrier is so good! From now on, I probably won't have to worry about psychic attacks from enemies anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unless their psychic power is much stronger than mine, they won't be able to hurt me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking this, Osborne felt even more grateful to Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His current strength was partly due to his own efforts and talent, but much was because of Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without her, passing the tests to become the Godfather's successor would have been a dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The strength of the soul barrier will grow as my soul power increases, so I just need to continue absorbing star power to enhance my soul power, and the soul barrier will become stronger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absorb star power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked up at the stars. After absorbing the light elemental essence, even within the dungeon, he could still feel the power of light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That meant he could absorb star power to enhance himself here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let's start cultivating!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne activated Satan's Eye, capturing star power to devour, instantly feeling a stronger control over star power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrible freezing effect of star power could hardly threaten him anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could now devour star power without restraint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This accelerated Osborne's advancement even further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, in this dungeon, he could absorb star power even during the day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt both his body and soul rapidly advancing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His Satan's Eye was also rapidly evolving.</span></p></div>
