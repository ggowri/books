        <h1>Chapter 1151 Herbmaster Canyon</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cillian pointed </span><span>at</span><span> a</span><span> massive canyon. "Godfather, over there is the back mountain of the Carey family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's Herbmaster Canyon. The reason our family has risen to prominence is all thanks to this place!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The soil and climate in Herbmaster Canyon are perfect for cultivating medicinal herbs. Many rare plants that can't thrive anywhere else flourish here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now, Herbmaster Canyon is ruined..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cillian's expression turned somber. "Three months ago, </span><span>there was a</span><span> </span><span>drastic environmental shift</span><span> </span><span>in </span><span>Blue Planet. Energy surged, causing plants to grow uncontrollably and animals to evolve and become restless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We</span><span> Carey family </span><span>put everything we had </span><span>to save the</span><span> </span><span>Herbmaster Canyon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then, out of nowhere, a massive fissure opened up in the canyon. Hundreds of our herbalists were swallowed whole in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When we rushed to investigate, hoping to rescue them or at least recover their bodies, we found the chasm was too deep to reach the bottom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The deeper we went, the more </span><span>intense</span><span> the energy became, and there was this terrifying force lurking within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of our elders ventured nearly two miles down before he suddenly went mad, attacking our own people before plunging into the depths. We never saw him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After that, we dared not explore the fissure any further. But we discovered that the energy within was several times denser than outside&mdash;it was practically a paradise for </span><span>train</span><span>ing</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, members of the Carey family began to train </span><span>in</span><span> the fissure, rapidly increasing their power...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But not long ago, a horde of Dark Exotic Beasts burst </span><span>out</span><span> from the depths and launched a brutal attack, causing </span><span>large</span><span> casualties. The power boost we gained from the fissure made us reluctant to abandon it, so we found ourselves forced to fight the beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unfortunately, the number of Dark Exotic Beasts continued to grow, their strength escalating beyond what we could handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We had no choice but to reveal the secret of the fissure and invite other wealthy families and Ancient Families from Eidolon City to help us</span><span> to</span><span> fend them off...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We promised them that if they eliminated all the beasts, they could send their own members into the fissure </span><span>for training</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yet, even with all that, we still couldn't hold them back...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Dark Exotic Beasts kept pouring out, increasing in number and strength </span><span>every day</span><span>. The numerous wealthy families and Ancient Families of Eidolon City couldn't </span><span>stop them</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the end, we decided to seek help from the Augustine family in Newport City</span><span> </span><span>after discussion</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Worried about exposing the fissure's secret, we couldn't be too explicit over the phone, which led to the Augustine family turning us down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then my </span><span>siblings and me </span><span>had no choice but </span><span>to cross the Lostridge Mountains and </span><span>plead for assistance from the Augustine family...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We underestimated the dangers of the Lostridge Mountains and were attacked by Dark Exotic Beasts. Luckily, we ran into you, Godfather; otherwise, we might not have made it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Osborne, gratitude shining in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, his gaze drifting toward the vast canyon</span><span> with</span><span> curiosity</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "A sudden, bottomless fissure?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy grows denser the deeper you go? Several times more potent than outside?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Dark Exotic Beasts keep emerging?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There's definitely a secret here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What lies at the bottom?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Treasures? Or perhaps Dark Deities?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go check it out!" Osborn</span><span> said</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Herbmaster Canyon, a fierce battle was unfolding. The rim of the canyon was lined with at least a thousand human warriors, encircling the entire Herbmaster Canyon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>E</span><span>ach </span><span>of them was</span><span> at least Class A.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but be astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eidolon City wasn't large; its </span><span>size</span><span> didn't even rank within the top hundred in Rosmandi. </span><span>But </span><span>it had managed to gather over a thousand Class A or above elites.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This would have been unimaginable three months ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, however, it was commonplace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Energy levels in the world had skyrocketed by hundreds of times, making breakthroughs for all sorts of powers as easy as breathing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, one might spend a lifetime without achieving a Class A breakthrough. Now, it required only a bit of effort to easily do so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over a thousand Class A or above elites already constituted a significant force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What they were currently besieging were a dozen Dark Exotic Beasts that looked like bats but were covered in scales and had wings edged with razor-sharp feathered quills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These Dark Exotic Beasts were the size of calves, with wingspans stretching at least 33 feet, slicing through the air like lethal blades, causing substantial casualties among the attackers with each swift movement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But their real terror lay in their sonic attacks!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From their mouths emerged ear-splitting sounds that caused excruciating headaches to their attackers, many plummeting from the sky in clusters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, only a dozen Dark Exotic Beasts had the thousand-strong elite forces of Eidolon City in utter disarray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These are Class S Dark Exotic Beasts!"</span></p></div>
