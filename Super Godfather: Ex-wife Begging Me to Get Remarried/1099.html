        <h1>Chapter 1098 Light of Redemption</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that all 400 Blood Demon members had successfully completed their breakthroughs and the intense energy fluctuations had subsided, Osborne finally dispelled the Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne used its power to mask the energy surges from many simultaneous Class S breakthroughs. Otherwise, the sheer magnitude of that energy would have been detectable from miles away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Osborne's trump card against the League of Divine Descent, and he wasn't about to reveal it prematurely. If the League's reinforcements decided not to show up, that would mean fewer targets to eliminate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With these 400 Class S Blood Demon members in reserve, the League of Divine Descent would have to send more than 200 Class S warriors in a short time to pose a real threat. But still, it's better to play it safe," Osborne murmured. "The real problem lies with their top-tier Class S warriors."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Osborne vanished from the spot, leaving the newly empowered Blood Demon members to undergo the final stages of their transformation. They no longer required Osborne's supervision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reappearing in the canyon, Osborne found the battle between the League of Divine Descent and the Aberrants still raging. Despite his absence of more than ten minutes, only about 20 more fighters had perished from both sides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered and ignored them. He turned his attention to the Augustine family members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!" They greeted Osborne eagerly, their eyes blazing with admiration and gratitude. Just moments earlier, they had been on the verge of total collapse. Had Osborne not appeared, they would have been torn apart by the assassins from the Eityreia Organization. At best, maybe a third of them would have managed to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But, because of Osborne, those assassins had all been wiped out. They were safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than that, they could now sit back and watch as the League of Divine Descent and the Aberrants' Class S warriors tore each other to pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne greeted everyone with a warm smile and looked toward the center of the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several elders of the Augustine family were standing guard around a large, imposing box. No matter how desperate their escape had been earlier, these elders had never abandoned the box, treating it with the utmost care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many didn't know what the box held, but Osborne did. Inside, he sensed Sebastian's familiar presence. Inside the box was the seriously injured and unconscious Sebastian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Approaching the elders, Osborne said, "Please open the box. I need to check on my grandfather's condition."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elders nodded and opened the box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As it opened, gasps filled the air. Inside lay the unconscious Sebastian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did everyone realize why the elders had been so protective of the box. Sebastian had been inside all along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne studied Sebastian intently. Sebastian had been gravely injured by Gerardo, and ever since, he'd remained in a coma. His condition now seemed even worse. If nothing changed, there was little hope he would ever wake again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's hope this works. If not, I'll have no choice but to ask Isa for help again," Osborne muttered. He signaled for everyone to step back, then acted decisively. "Light Realm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A soft hum echoed as the Light Realm enveloped Osborne and Sebastian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Osborne's breakthrough to Class S, his control over the Light Realm had grown significantly. He could now focus its power within a much smaller area, conserving his energy while still achieving the desired effect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The light spread across a radius of just 30 feet, and it was all Osborne needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Light of Redemption!" Osborne invoked the spell, and a radiant beam of pure light descended from above, enveloping Sebastian's unconscious body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the first time Osborne had used the Light of Redemption since his breakthrough to Class S, and immediately, he sensed something different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once purely white light was now edged with a faint golden hue, brimming with immense life energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the light bathed Sebastian, a rapid transformation began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Injuries that had previously left Osborne powerless to heal were mended instantly. Even the damage to Sebastian's essence was restored in the blink of an eye. Sebastian's once-pallid complexion turned a healthy shade of red, and astonishingly, his aged features seemed to reverse, making him appear thirty years younger. Sebastian looked vital and full of life, like a man in his prime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned by the dramatic change. His heart raced with anticipation as he watched his grandfather's body heal before his eyes, though he remained uncertain whether Sebastian would actually wake up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the Light of Redemption didn't let Osborne down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian opened his eyes the next moment, and a sharp gleam flashed across them. He bolted upright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, you're awake!" Osborne exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian turned to Osborne. He smiled as he nodded firmly. "Yes, I'm awake! In fact, I've been awake the whole time. I just couldn't control my body. But everything that happened, I'm aware of it all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you've done wonderfully, truly," Sebastian continued as tears rolled down.</span></p></div>
