        <h1>Chapter 8 Got Twenty Million Dollars</h1>
        <div><p>Ophelia frowned, unable to utter a single word.</p><p>Just a few hours ago, she would&#x27;ve sworn she knew Osborne inside out.</p><p>But now, watching the crazed Osborne and the bodyguards on the ground, groaning in pain, she suddenly realized that this man in front of her was no longer the spineless husband she once knew.</p><p>Why has he gone so crazy?</p><p>Could it be that he loved her so deeply that the news of their divorce had driven him mad?</p><p>Ophelia thought she might be able to use this to her advantage.</p><p>Her voice softened immediately. &quot;Osborne, I know you&#x27;ve been wronged. Making you leave the marriage with nothing was the decision of the Elder Council of the Caldwell family, not mine. In fact, I still love you.</p><p>&quot;Look, I&#x27;ll order the hospital staff to leave right away. You put down the bomb remote, and we can have a good chat.</p><p>&quot;Maybe we can come up with a better solution.</p><p>&quot;I don&#x27;t really want to divorce you either.&quot;</p><p>Ophelia looked all tender, but to Osborne, it just seemed fake and disgusting.</p><p>Osborne sneered, &quot;Ophelia, stop acting.</p><p>&quot;You don&#x27;t know me, but I know you well. Your acting skills are terrible! First, get the hospital staff out of here. Then, give me enough divorce compensation. Otherwise, we&#x27;ll go to hell together!</p><p>&quot;Anyway, you&#x27;re the heir of a wealthy family, in control of a billion-dollar fortune, and of high status. I&#x27;m just an orphan, a commoner with no power or influence. It won&#x27;t be a bad deal for me to have you accompany me to hell.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You—&quot; Ophelia gritted her teeth in anger, feeling extremely frustrated.</p><p>The once good-for-nothing Osborne now had the upper hand in this confrontation.</p><p>What could she do to turn the tables?</p><p>Did she really have to give Osborne divorce compensation?</p><p>Ophelia didn&#x27;t dare to bet that Osborne wouldn&#x27;t detonate the bomb.</p><p>She didn&#x27;t want to die.</p><p>Ophelia&#x27;d just become the heir of the Caldwell family and hadn&#x27;t even started to enjoy the wealth and power.</p><p>Thinking of this, Ophelia finally caved in.</p><p>&quot;Okay, I agree. I&#x27;ll give you divorce compensation!</p><p>&quot;We can draw up a new divorce agreement. On behalf of the Caldwell family, I&#x27;ll give you two million dollars as compensation!&quot;</p><p>Ophelia had finally backed down.</p><p>Although two million was far less than the 10 million Osborne needed to pass the test, since she&#x27;d given in, the rest was just a matter of negotiation.</p><p>Osborne let out a sigh of relief but sneered, &quot;Two million? Are you kidding me?</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;ve served the Caldwell family for three years, endured three years of humiliation and abuse. You think two million can buy me off? Well, I&#x27;d rather go to hell with you all!&quot;</p><p>With that, Osborne raised the bomb remote again, pretending to press the button.</p><p>Ophelia&#x27;s face turned pale, and she quickly shouted, &quot;Stop!</p><p>&quot;How much do you want then? 100 million dollars is impossible! You know that even as the heir of the Caldwell family, I don&#x27;t have the power to decide on such a huge amount of property distribution. There&#x27;s still the Elder Council above me.</p><p>&quot;If you insist on 100 million, then go ahead and detonate the bomb.&quot;</p><p>After Ophelia finished speaking, Osborne pretended to ponder.</p><p>He knew the situation of the Caldwell family well and understood that Ophelia couldn&#x27;t give him 100 million in cash. He&#x27;d asked for such a large amount just for the sake of bargaining.</p><p>It was like asking to open a window on the wall. If everyone opposed it, but you first proposed to tear down the whole roof, then they might agree to the window.</p><p>Now, Osborne was in no hurry at all. He had the initiative in his hands.</p><p>After some back-and-forth, they finally reached an agreement.</p><p>The Caldwell family would compensate Osborne with 20 million dollars.</p><p>Twenty million was five times less than what Osborne had initially asked for, but it was twice as much as what was required for Godfather&#x27;s first test.</p><p>Osborne was quite satisfied, yet he put on a look of having gotten the short end of the stick. He demanded that Ophelia draw up a new divorce compensation agreement.</p><p>Before long, the 20 million dollars was transferred to his account. Finally, Osborne let his guard down.</p><p>He&#x27;d actually done it!</p><p>He&#x27;d completed the Godfather&#x27;s test for the heir!</p><p>At this moment, Osborne felt like crying.</p><p>If it hadn&#x27;t been for the Godfather&#x27;s test, he would never have dared to storm the Caldwell Estate alone. Moreover, without anyone&#x27;s help, relying solely on his courage, wits, and even a touch of madness, he&#x27;d managed to get the Caldwell family to compensate him 20 million dollars.</p><p>It was nothing short of a miracle.</p><p>Just a few hours ago, he&#x27;d been beaten up by Ophelia&#x27;s bodyguards and forced to sign a divorce agreement that would leave him penniless, with no way out.</p><p>But now, not only had he received the compensation he deserved, but he&#x27;d also passed the Godfather&#x27;s first test for the heir.</p><p>From now on, Osborne was the Godfather&#x27;s prospective heir.</p><p>He wondered what the reward would be.</p><p>Wealth?</p><p>Power?</p><p>Or women?</p><p>The Godfather, such a powerful figure and his own grandfather, surely wouldn&#x27;t be stingy, right?</p><p>&quot;Time to leave!&quot;</p><p>Osborne was about to leave to claim the Godfather&#x27;s reward.</p><p>But then, something unexpected happened.</p><p>A woman in the crowd glanced at her phone and let out a startled cry.</p><p>&quot;Ophelia, we can&#x27;t let him go!</p><p>&quot;We&#x27;ve all been duped. This damned good-for-nothing, the explosives on him are all fake!&quot;</p></div>
