        <h1>Chapter 79 Provocation</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What are you looking at? Go back to your post!&rdquo; Thomas sneered and scolded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne took a deep breath and suppressed his anger. He walked into the guard booth calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The main job of the security team was patrolling and standing guard. Since Osborne had become a security officer, he could only endure it. If he argued with these vigilantes and beat them, he would fall into Paul&rsquo;s trap. Paul was hoping that Osborne would take action. So he could find a way to fire Osborne. Osborne didn&rsquo;t want to be fired. He could only endure it for the time being.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul was targeting him because of what he said yesterday. He told Ms. Donna Radcliffe that Paul might be a spy for the assassin. Ms. Donna Radcliffe didn&rsquo;t believe Osborne. He offended Paul. However, the more sensitive he was, the more it showed that there was something wrong with him. Maybe he had to start from Paul.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne stood straight in the sentry box.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Standing guard was effortless for Osborne. He would not feel tired even if he stood for twenty-four hours.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Moreover, Osborne could practice The Breath of Celestial while standing guard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Every moment, his strength was improving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne suddenly felt that the job of standing guard at the gate was not bad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, some people didn&rsquo;t want him to be so comfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When the people from the third guard group saw Osborne standing in the guardhouse without any resistance, they all showed disappointment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Mr. Edbercon, he&rsquo;s so calm. What should we do?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;This shows that we didn&rsquo;t provoke him that much. Come with me.&rdquo; Thomas pulled a long face and led his men toward Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The task Paul gave him was to provoke Osborne and let Osborne attack them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As long as Osborne took action, Paul would have reason to fire Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;As long as I accomplish this,&rdquo; Thomas said to himself, &ldquo;I will be promoted by Paul and become the leader of the security team. I will command six security teams.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Thinking of this, Thomas felt so excited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He walked to the guard post and sneered, &ldquo;Let me introduce myself. I&rsquo;m the leader of the third security team. My name is Thomas. Remember, all your work from now on will be assigned by me. If I tell you to stand guard, you stand guard. If I tell you to patrol, you patrol. No matter what time it is, no matter what you are doing, as long as my order arrives, you must execute it immediately. Did you hear that clearly?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Thomas seemed to tell Osborne that If you dare not obey my orders, you would be doomed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne said calmly, &ldquo;My working hours are only eight hours.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Osborne finished speaking, Thomas and others burst into laughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand? I don&rsquo;t care how many hours you work. You must listen to me when I give an order. Even if you are having a sex, you must get up immediately. Understand?&rdquo; Thomas looked threatening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s expression turned cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But he still said calmly, &ldquo;What if I don&rsquo;t listen?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Thomas had a contemptuous look. He suddenly pulled out his gun and pointed it at Osborne&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want to listen to me, I will shoot you to death. It will do no harm to me. I will even accuse you of being a spy. What can you do?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. We can all testify.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;If you dare not listen, we will all insist that you are a spy.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You dare not obey the orders. How dare you?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Several guards smiled and spoke at this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Thomas sneered and said, &ldquo;I might as well tell you that you have offended Captain Paul. From now on, you will never have a good life here. If you don&rsquo;t want to die, just lie down like a dog. Do you understand?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You still dare to laugh?&rdquo; Thomas felt provoked and gave a cold order. &ldquo;Now, I order you to patrol the toilet immediately. I am afraid that the enemy may sneak in. Go to the toilet now and check the toilet carefully three times.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The people behind Thomas burst into laughter. &ldquo;Go patrol the toilet!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You must patrol every corner.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;That taste must be very refreshing.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne became furious. He clenched his fists tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He knew that these people were trying to provoke him on purpose. The sensible thing to do was to endure it. But if he tolerated this, what kind of man was he?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne said coldly, &ldquo;Is this Paul&rsquo;s method? It&rsquo;s really despicable. But do you think you can scare me like this? You can try shooting at me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Thomas sneered, &ldquo;Do you think I don&rsquo;t dare?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After saying that, he suddenly opened the safety of his pistol. His eyes were full of ferocity and coldness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">There was murderous intent in Osborne&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Do you want to take action?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Thomas and his companions were not afraid at all. They said, &ldquo;Try to fight us.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;How can this coward dare to do it?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Just go patrol the toilet!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Waste!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Get out!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne took a deep breath and suddenly closed his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When he opened his eyes again, the pupil of his left eye suddenly melted and turned into two pupils. Three silver stars flickered in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne opened Satan&rsquo;s Eye.</p></div>
