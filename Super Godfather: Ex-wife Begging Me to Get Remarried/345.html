        <h1>Chapter 345 So Powerful</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but feel shocked that he had blown up the metahuman's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Illusion Projection was so powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The metahuman was at Class A, surpassing Osborne by half a power level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when faced with Osborne's Illusion Projection, he became completely ensnared in the illusions and unable to escape. It was only the threat to his life that finally woke him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, it was too late by then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I had realized Illusion Projection was this potent, why would I have bothered with so much effort? I could have simply projected illusions earlier and wiped them all out!" Osborne muttered with a wry smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nonetheless, he understood that this was impractical. The premise behind the powerful Illusion Projection was its significant drain on his mental energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After just one use, Osborne, who hadn't experienced fatigue in a long while, actually felt a bit drowsy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Illusion Projection was employed three times consecutively, he probably couldn't engage in any more fights but would have to find a place to sleep and recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Illusion Projection consumes too much mental energy, so I can't use it frequently, but it can serve as my trump card! Moreover, I can reduce the consumption of mental energy. While its impact may not be overwhelming, even a slight disruption of the enemy's focus can provide a significant advantage."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After figuring it out, Osborne smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, it was not the time to be happy. He looked into the distance with Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over there, Jacob and Layla found themselves locked in a fierce battle. With three opponents of the same level, resistance was growing increasingly challenging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the situation continued, they would die in battle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Farther away, Alisa Ship came under attack from nine Class B+ strong men. Its escort team, along with Ryan, Nathan, and others, collaborated to fend them off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given their strength, they couldn't hold out for too long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face darkened. "It seems that Ghost Ship is determined to destroy the Augustine family and shatter all their hopes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He snorted coldly, "Unfortunately, I am here, so you are doomed to fail!" He violently tore the space apart and plunged into the dimensional rift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In order to get there as quickly as possible, he didn't care too much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, he appeared half a mile away. Not far away, Jacob and Layla joined forces to resist the siege of three Class A martial artists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&#8203;Their fierce battle, shrouded in a dense fog, had masked Osborne's sudden arrival from all eyes.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hesitated for a moment and did not take action himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered, "Let me show you how potent Illusion Projection is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes narrowed menacingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Illusions pierced the minds of the three martial artists via Satan's Eye. This time, Osborne wielded Illusion Projection with refined control, minimizing its mental energy drain. Yet, the trio still succumbed briefly to the illusions, their bodies stiffening with vacant stares.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a battle between masters, a slight distraction could completely change the result.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacob and Layla quickly sensed something amiss with the three martial artists. Though they didn't grasp the reason, their extensive combat experience compelled them not to let this opportunity slip away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all immediately unleashed their most powerful attacks, each targeting a different enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the threat, the two martial artists snapped out of it just in time, but they had already lost the upper hand, hastily defending their vital points before taking the blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, they were gravely wounded, blood flowing profusely, their faces etched with fear and confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on? What exactly did I just see? Why did I suddenly lose focus in the middle of a fierce battle?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne didn't allow them a moment to recover. As the first attempt had failed to kill them, he would try again.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He once again projected illusions into their minds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the two fell into confusion again, immersed in the illusions and unable to extricate themselves. Despite their visible struggle, they remained trapped without immediate escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Layla and Jacob glanced at each other in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they still did not miss the opportunity and launched violent attacks on the two men again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, luck ran out for the two men ensnared in the illusions. They bore the brunt of the blows, and their chests collapsed instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The divine light in their eyes quickly disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until their death, the two Class A- martial artists still had no idea what had happened or why they had suddenly lost focus in the fierce battle, besieged by vivid illusions in their minds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The metal metahuman, who was about to deliver a deadly strike, suddenly witnessed his two companions being killed. Shock and horror immediately swept over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he pivoted around and ran away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Osborne wouldn't let him flee. He had already pinpointed his metal elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered and projected an illusion into the man's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he finally showed up and rushed at the man himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, he shouted at Jacob and Layla, "Jacob, Layla, leave this man to me. Hurry back to Alisa Ship to rescue others!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne slapped the man on the chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man immediately coughed up blood and was hurled backward, crashing heavily into the sea.</span></p></div>
