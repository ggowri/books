        <h1>Chapter 919 Trouble at the Door</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa stood up, her expression serious. "I can't let my teacher down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's still fighting in Celestara. Even though she and the God of Light are powerful, they can't possibly handle the countless evil beings in Celestara, let alone Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're waiting for me. I need to find the reincarnations of the five Deity Kings to help restore their powers, and then we can head to Celestara to support them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Osborne, her gaze unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart sank. If what Isa said was true, he had no right to ask her to stay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel the immense responsibility weighing on her shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Isa failed to find the reincarnated Deity Kings, the entire world could face annihilation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, is there anything I can do to help?" Osborne asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smiled softly, "Of course! What you can do is to train hard and become stronger. To truly defeat Lord Malevolence and deal with the countless evil creatures in Celestara, or the awakened Dark Deities, we can't rely solely on a few Deity Kings. We all need to become stronger. Only then can we protect this land and ultimately achieve victory."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Isa stepped closer and rested her head against Osborne's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I don't want to leave you. I've cherished every moment spent with you&mdash;this time has been the happiest of my life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now, I must fulfill my mission! Let Clarissa and Emma stay with you for now. Once I complete my task or find the time, I'll come back to see you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she prepared to leave, Osborne opened his mouth, but the words of protest died on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he pulled her into a tight embrace. "I'll be waiting for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa nodded, ready to depart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, her expression hardened as she hissed, "You've got to be kidding me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong?" Osborne asked, alarmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's voice turned icy. "I'm glad I didn't rush off. I warned those fools before, but they still dared to come after you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I'll take care of them and then leave. You don't need to worry about me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she vanished in a flash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart raced. He immediately felt the tremor of his Draco Star Wristlet flashing a menacing red light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh no! Red alert? This can't be good! Mr. Wesson Augustine is in trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second thought, he tore open a rift in Dimensional Space and stepped through, reappearing at Mount Celestial Reach in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere at Mount Celestial Reach was tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson, Declan, Bob, Caleb, and the other elders of the Augustine family stood with grim expressions, glaring at a group of people across from them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the forefront were two imposing figures&mdash;Rumen and Everett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both were Class S powerhouses, hovering in the air with disdainful looks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind them stood several familiar faces from the League of Divine Descent, the Eityreia Organization, and the Aberrants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart sank as he recognized Marlon, Scarlett, and Bradley among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes blazed with anger and hatred as they locked onto him, as if they would leap at the chance to kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring their glares, Osborne rushed to Wesson's side. "Mr. Wesson Augustine, what's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson's face grew serious as he whispered, "Godfather, they're here to cause trouble! Rumen claims his daughter, Ebony, is missing and suspects the Augustine family is behind it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's forcing us to hand her over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression darkened at the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen interjected, his voice dripping with menace, "Wesson, are you going to hand her over or not? How dare you send people to kidnap my daughter! If you don't release her immediately, you'll regret it! If she's unharmed, I'll leave right away. But if anything happens to her, you'll all pay the price!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Rumen spoke, a palpable aura of threat surrounded Wesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paled but clenched his jaw defiantly. "Rumen, the Augustine family had nothing to do with your daughter's disappearance. We don't know who took her! You've come to the wrong place&mdash;this isn't a playground for your antics. Please leave at once!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen scoffed, saying, "Not you? I have proof!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of his hand, a projection flickered to life before them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The image showed a group of masked figures wearing Augustine family attire, swiftly carrying the injured Ebony away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but chuckle at the absurdity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "This flimsy video counts as evidence? Rumen probably just rounded up a few random people, dressed them up in our family's clothes, and staged this whole thing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He's using this as an excuse to come after the Augustine family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As that thought settled in, Osborne's expression hardened with cold resolve.</span></p></div>
