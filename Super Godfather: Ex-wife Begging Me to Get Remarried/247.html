        <h1>Chapter 247 Significant Gap</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ashford family, like the Caldwell family, was a wealthy family in </span><span>Mayby</span><span> City, but the former was more powerful and ranked among the top five in </span><span>Mayby</span><span> City, with more information channels than the latter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley had naturally heard of Osborne from </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Ophelia, why are you asking him? Do you think that Osborne from </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security is your useless ex-husband? Stop kidding. They just have the same name by </span><span>coincidence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia smiled, "Of course, I know they are not the same person, and I know exactly what my good-for-nothing ex-husband is capable of. Even if Osborne lives another hundred years, he will never become such a big shot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley nodded. "Indeed! Although both of them are called Osborne, they </span><span>can not</span><span> be compared at all. Osborne, the mysterious boss of </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security, is like a god in the sky, while your useless ex-husband Osborne is just an ant on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Moreover, I have seen a photo of the mysterious boss of </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security. He is a middle-aged man and looks completely different from Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In fact, Osborne, the mysterious boss of </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security, is now my idol. He single-handedly forced the Chevalier family to flee </span><span>Skyefall</span><span>. Such a big shot is a truly capable person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unfortunately, I haven't had the chance to meet him yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, I have already sent a wedding invitation to </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security. Perhaps he will be in a good mood and come to our wedding..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley's face was full of anticipation at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia also had some expectations. If such a big shot could appear at her wedding, she would also feel honored. It would be even better if she could flatter him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That Osborne could decide the life or death of a wealthy family like the Caldwell family with just one word, and could also make the Caldwell family prosper with just one word, which made it become the top wealthy family in </span><span>Mayby</span><span> City easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I have to continue preparing for the wedding. Ophelia, after tomorrow, you will be my wife, and I don't allow you to mention that loser Osborne anymore, because he...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not worthy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nodded quickly and said in a soft tone, "Okay! I promise you. I will never mention that loser Osborne again. After tomorrow's wedding, he will have nothing to do with me anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley hung up the phone. Then, Ophelia continued to try on the dress, fantasizing about her grand wedding tomorrow and how she would become the brightest focus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Radcliffe Manor, Clarissa was also trying on a dress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wearing the pure white dress, she looked like an unparalleled goddess. Even Donna, who was also a woman, was a bit dizzy and mesmerized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, are you really going to attend the wedding of the Ashford family and the Caldwell family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just the wedding of two wealthy heirs in </span><span>Mayby</span><span> City. With your status, there's no need for you to attend in person. I can send anyone to the wedding at will, and it's very honored for them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa smiled slightly as she heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I have to attend in person!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because she and Osborne had already agreed to publicly announce their romantic relationship at that wedding, letting everyone know that she, Clarissa, would be </span><span>Osborne's woman from now on!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she had to be there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the protagonist of tomorrow's wedding was Osborne's ex-wife, Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Clarissa said that she didn't care about Osborne's past, she was still a little unhappy when she thought that Ophelia was Osborne's ex-wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most important thing was that Ophelia was not nice to Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire Caldwell family bullied and humiliated Osborne during the three years that he married Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Clarissa was Osborne's girlfriend, and she must help Osborne vent his anger. The first thing she had to do was to overshadow Ophelia at the wedding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who said the bride must be the most dazzling person at the wedding?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She insisted on dressing up carefully to steal all the limelight that belonged to Ophelia at the wedding. Clarissa wanted to tell her that it was not that Osborne was not worthy of her, but that she was not worthy of Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He broke up with Ophelia and would find a more beautiful and excellent girlfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she left Osborne and would live in regret for the rest of her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were what Clarissa wanted to do in her heart, but she would not tell Donna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, she would definitely stop Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt Donna, don't worry about it anyway. I must go to that wedding tomorrow, so can you help me see which dress looks the most beautiful on me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna looked helpless and could only help give advice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, do you know the mysterious boss of </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security, whose name is Osborne?" Suddenly, Donna asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's body trembled, and an embarrassed look appeared on her pretty face. She knew, of course. Osborne had confessed to her a long time ago, but she was not in a position to tell Donna this secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could only remain calm and asked, "I know. How could I not have heard such shocking news? Aunt Donna, why are you asking this? You don't think that the mysterious boss of </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security, Osborne, is Osborne who we know, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna rolled her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is that possible? I'm just curious, after all, the mysterious boss of </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security, Osborne, single-handedly defeated the Chevalier family and forced them to flee </span><span>Skyefall</span><span>. How could he be Osborne we know?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The gap between them is too huge!"</span></p></div>
