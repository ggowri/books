        <h1>Chapter 1011 A False Alarm</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy within Anastasia's body was not only powerful but also growing stronger with each passing moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, it was highly unstable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone who approached her in her current state would trigger a violent reaction from this energy, unleashing a force that even a Class A couldn't withstand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this didn't faze Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zoe, don't worry. Stay put, and I'll go check on her," Osborne said, already moving towards Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he walked, he watched her condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia appeared to be in much better shape than before. Her face was flushed, indicating that she had recovered from her illness despite her still slender frame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could feel a powerful vitality emanating from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but look surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This vitality was shocking even to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could there be such vigorous life force? Even I can't compare. Even top-tier Class S like Sin and Crimson don't have this kind of vitality! What happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The closer he got to Anastasia, the more he could feel the immense vitality in her body, like an ocean, vast and boundless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A body like this could probably recover quickly from even the most severe injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he approached, the energy around Anastasia began to stir, seemingly on guard. Osborne felt that it was ready to attack anyone who came near her as if they were an enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, still unconscious, couldn't control this energy, leading to the current situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued his approach, prepared for an attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, unexpectedly, the energy stabilized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne reached Anastasia's side without resistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Makenzie and Zoe, who were outside the room, were both stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's strange. Everyone who approaches Anastasia gets attacked, but why did her energy stabilize when you got close?" Makenzie asked in amazement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, seemed to have figured it out, his face filled with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia! You're awake, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice trembled as he gazed intently at her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia still hovered in mid-air, her eyes tightly shut, showing no reaction. But the energy around her fluctuated slightly, as if responding to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This excited Osborne even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was almost certain that Anastasia was now awake, at least partially aware of her surroundings. The reason he wasn't attacked was definitely because Anastasia had </span><span>knew</span><span> it was him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne grasped Anastasia's hand tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia, if you can hear me, make the energy fluctuate three times," Osborne said tensely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy around Anastasia fluctuated exactly three times and then stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes welled up with tears at this confirmation. Anastasia was really awake!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't know why she couldn't open her eyes or how she had gained such powerful energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as long as she was awake, nothing else mattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne held Anastasia's hand tightly, his grip firm and reassuring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a thorough examination of Anastasia's body, Osborne finally emerged from the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, how is Anastasia?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's going to be fine, right?" Zoe asked anxiously, her expression filled with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded reassuringly. "Don't worry, Anastasia's fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he turned to Makenzie. "Ms. Harvey, I need to take Anastasia home with me! Her is already conscious, but the overwhelming energy within her body hasn't stabilized yet, so she can't control her physical movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right now, she's like a ticking bomb. Anyone coming near her could trigger a violent reaction. It's too dangerous for her to stay here; I can't bear the thought of leaving her behind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Makenzie paused, pondering his words, and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood. Her illness has been cured, and I have no clue about the energy appeared within her. But it seems to be a good thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As her energy levels rise, her vitality is becoming increasingly robust. Take her home, and I'll check on her regularly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, bowing respectfully to Makenzie. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, thank you, Ms. Harvey, for healing Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If there's ever anything you need from me in the future, just say the word, and I won't hesitate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly thereafter, Osborne took Anastasia away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He settled her and Zoe at Mount Celestial Reach, not far from Sebastian's room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne kept a vigilant watch over Anastasia, holding her hand and speaking to her, even though most of the time, he received no response. Yet, the occasional signs of reaction from Anastasia were enough to bring a smile to Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel the energy within Anastasia growing rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within three hours, it surged from Class A to Class AA, and it continued to escalate as if without limits.</span></p></div>
