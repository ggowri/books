        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the real reason why Osborne wasn't in a hurry to chase after Terrence and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his spatial power, tracking them down would be a walk in the park. However, the Deschanel Clan still had eighteen Transcendent Deities in their ranks, and chasing after them alone would be futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If those eighteen scattered in different directions, it would be even more impossible for him to catch them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was better to allow the Blood Demon members to enhance their strengths before systematically taking them all down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get started!" Osborne declared decisively, without any further hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, he began transmitting the massive blood energy he had collected to the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This blood energy had been refined and purified by the Lotus, and once it entered the bodies of the Blood Demon members, it would expedite their breakthroughs, amplifying their powers significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Osborne distributed the blood energy evenly among 12 hundred Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, they began their breakthroughs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three hours later, the transformation was complete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The number of Intermediate Deities among the Blood Demon members had risen to around 16 hundred. Over a third of Blood Demon had achieved this new level of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overall strength of the Blood Demon had surged once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured, icy resolve glinting in his eyes, "With the Deschanel Clan's eighteen Transcendent Deities and nine Superior Deities out there, eliminating them all would provide enough blood energy to empower nearly two thousand Blood Demon members to become Intermediate Deities!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once that happens, we'll be more than ready to take on the Pantheon League and the Eityreia Organization!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's time to deal with Terrence and the others. Hope that they've found a good hiding spot, or they'll be found easily!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He made his way back to the Deschanel Clan's hideout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, just in time! Come take a look at what we've found," Sebastian called out as soon as he spotted Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curious, Osborne approached. He saw the upper echelons of the Augustine family grouped together, surrounding a number of people who looked utterly terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on? Who are they?" Osborne asked, intrigued as he eyed the anxious crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they appeared disheveled, each one of them exuded a potent aura of authority that hinted at their formidable background.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian smiled, "These are the leaders of several superpowers from the surrounding nations! The Deschanel Clan had grand ambitions; they previously swept through dozens of superpowers, capturing their leaders to force them into submission. But now? The Deschanel Clan has met its downfall at our hands! Coincidentally, I know these leaders well&mdash;they used to be my rivals."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smile crept onto Sebastian's face as he wrapped up his explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened as he processed this revelation. "So these are the leaders of all the superpowers from the neighboring territories?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Does that mean if they swear loyalty to the Augustine family, we'll instantly become the dominant power in the region? That would certainly lighten my load."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to the group, his own expression turning smug. "Grandpa, what's your plan from here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian chuckled. "We're going to pick up where the Deschanel Clan left off! These leaders already intended to pledge their loyalty to the Deschanel Clan, which is why they're here. Now that the Deschanel Clan has been dealt with, they'll naturally have to submit to the Augustine family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I'm not entirely convinced of their loyalty. We're in the middle of discussing how to handle them. And now that you're here, you're the head of the Augustine family. Why don't you take the reins on this one?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded at Sebastian's words, stepping forward with an air of authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fixed his icy gaze on the group of leaders before him and asked flatly, "Are you willing to submit to the Augustine family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leaders exchanged panicked glances, and almost simultaneously, they nodded vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! Yes, we'll pledge our loyalty! We're ready to be vassals of the Augustine family, as long as you grant us a chance to survive!" they pleaded, their voices a frenzied chorus of desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear hung heavily in the air like a thick fog. The terrifying might of the Deschanel Clan had left a lasting impression on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their nerves were frayed; they understood that refusing to submit could very well mean extermination for their families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overwhelming power that the Augustine family had demonstrated just by taking down the Deschanel Clan made any thoughts of rebellion seem like a fool's errand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they were all too eager to comply, somewhere deep inside their hearts lingered the question of its sincerity. Only they knew how forced this allegiance was, and as for any future rebellion... well, that was a secret they kept to themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Augustine family weren't naive; they had their doubts about the loyalty of these leaders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shared those doubts, but unlike the others, he had a plan up his sleeve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've made the right choice. I won't seek your lives today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But heed my words: I require absolute loyalty from my vassals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, let go of your fears and open yourselves up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent as the leaders exchanged uncertain glances, unsure of what Osborne was up to. Yet, under the weight of his cold and piercing stare, they had little choice but to comply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Osborne embarked on his plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The key to ensuring their loyalty was simple&mdash;transform them all into Blood Clan members.</span></p></div>
