        <h1>Chapter 1421 Bribery</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just wait until I regain my strength; I'll turn all of you into Blood Clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne cast a cold glance at Jeffrey and the others, a mocking smile creeping into his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To execute his plan using Lachlan's identity, he knew he had to maintain his cover at all costs. Although he had narrowly avoided detection this time, with Jeffrey and the others not suspecting him, he couldn't count on that luck holding out forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his confidence in the Eclipsing Mantra, Osborne was aware that the world was vast, and anything could happen. There were countless abilities out there that could expose him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To ensure his identity remained hidden, he needed to transform those closest to Lachlan into Blood Clan members. That way, if anyone ever questioned his identity, these individuals could vouch for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, having his inner circle as Blood Clan would make it much easier for Osborne to operate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he continued to convert more people into Blood Clan, his rise within the Wild Flame Army would become effortless, allowing him to gradually seize control without anyone realizing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for now, he had to bide his time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey was a top-tier Transcendent Deity warrior, stronger than the Lachlan of old. With Osborne's current strength, he couldn't confidently take Jeffrey on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the other nine squad leaders, four were also Transcendent Deity warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne needed to regain more power before making any moves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, everyone, let's wrap this up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tomorrow morning, we head straight to the No. 9 mining area for the mission. This task is crucial for me, so if anyone slows me down, don't say I didn't warn you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey's voice was cold, and he cast a pointed look at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other nine squad leaders exchanged mocking glances with Osborne before making their exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Osborne was about to leave, Jeffrey called out, "Lachlan, stay a moment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne halted, turning back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the others had left, Jeffrey took a sip from his coffee cup, only to spit it out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! This coffee tastes awful! I just can't get used to it. I don't understand why the esteemed Lord Malevolence and those noble Paramount Supreme Clan folks enjoy this stuff."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then turned his gaze to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Lachlan, did you gain anything extra from this mission?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback, not quite grasping Jeffrey's intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly rifled through Lachlan's memories and then understood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a forced smile, he replied, "Mr. Alick, the mission was short, so the gains were minimal, but I did manage to gather a few things. I've prepared the share for you; please take a look."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He produced twenty mid-grade Essence Crystals, and Jeffrey's eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He eagerly accepted the crystals, his demeanor shifting to one of warmth as he regarded Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good! Very good! Lachlan, you took a heavy hit on this mission and could have faced serious consequences&mdash;demotion or even expulsion would have been perfectly reasonable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, you're from the Human Community, and the soldiers from other races have their grievances against you lot. It's far too common for a Human Community member to be dismissed or thrown in jail for even minor infractions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you've shown some sense, so I'll help you keep this under wraps. Just make sure to do a good job for me in the future, and I won't shortchange you. Got it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Jeffrey's words, Osborne couldn't help but chuckle inwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wondered, "Do a good job for him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's more like making sure he gets his hands on those Essence Crystals!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Twenty mid-grade Essence Crystals can be exchanged for two thousand low-grade ones&mdash;that's equivalent to a whole month's military stipend for the former Lachlan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even for someone like Jeffrey, a centurion, that's a significant amount."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The reason the old Lachlan exploited the Human Community miners so ruthlessly was largely to bribe people like Jeffrey."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As a member of the Human Community, he knew that to carve out a place for himself in the Wild Flame Army and avoid becoming a target, bribery was often the only way to go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for your support, Mr. Alick. I'll work even harder and make sure not to disappoint you," Osborne said, feigning enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But inside, he was smirking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want me to keep bribing you? Just wait until this mission is over. I'll turn you into one of my Blood Clan descendants, and then it'll be you doing the bribing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey waved him off with a smile. "Alright, off you go! Go collect your Malevolence Amulet. As for the four missing members of your squad, we'll sort that out after this mission wraps up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally free from Jeffrey's stone chamber, Osborne made his way to the supply depot, guided by Lachlan's memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Here, he could collect his new Malevolence Amulet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was genuinely intrigued by the Malevolence Amulet. It was essentially a defensive divine artifact but even more effective than the usual ones. In the face of a lethal attack, it would automatically activate to protect its wearer, leaving behind a formidable shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without the Malevolence Amulet, taking out Lachlan would have been a much simpler task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such defensive artifacts were incredibly valuable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, astonishingly, every squad leader and above in the Wild Flame Army had one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed they were being produced in bulk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Malevolence Amulet is manufactured by the Artisan Institute. That place is no joke! If I could get my hands on the technology for mass-producing these amulets, I could equip all the members of the Blood Demon with them!"</span></p></div>
