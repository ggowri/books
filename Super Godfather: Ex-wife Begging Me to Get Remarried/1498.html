        <h1>Chapter 1497 Drive Away</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oswald's eyes darted menacingly around the crowd, a mixture of suspicion and disdain in his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were the representatives from various factions and powerful clans, all eagerly awaiting Fabian's success in taking down Osborne. Their plan was to pounce on the spoils&mdash;Osborne's prized slaves&mdash;once he was disposed of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But their hopes were dashed when Fabian couldn't even lay a finger on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Oswald appeared, their plans crumbled before their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian, the Deity Overlord, couldn't kill Osborne today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And if Fabian, with all his power, couldn't do it, then none of these onlookers stood a chance either. Though their hearts were filled with reluctance, they grudgingly nodded to Oswald and hastily withdrew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That Human Community guy made a big splash today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just breaking through to Celestial Deity, yet he managed to hold off Fabian for twenty minutes without so much as a touch! In all of Wild Flame City, there might not be a hundred Celestial Deity warriors, even those in the later and peak stages, who could pull off such a feat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But let's not forget, this is the inner city, which restricts Fabian's abilities. Out in the wild, where Fabian has no limits, that guy wouldn't stand a chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's made a mortal enemy of Fabian, and with Fabian's temperament, he'll hound him like a remorseless shadow. Once he steps out of Wild Flame City, Fabian will strike. The outcome for him is sealed&mdash;death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too bad we can't get a piece of the action now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the crowd dispersed, the slave market settled into quietude, leaving only a few from the major factions, with Fabian lingering behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fabian, aren't you leaving yet?" Oswald inquired, his brows furrowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian clenched his fists, his anger palpable. "Relax, I won't make another move. I just need to say a few words to that guy before I go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His icy stare fixed on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian seethed. "You, I remember this day. Don't get too smug; you survived because this is Wild Flame City, where my strength is shackled!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one provokes me and lives to tell the tale. I'll keep a close eye on you. Better stay within the city limits forever because if I catch you outside, you're as good as dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll grind you into a bloody pulp and devour every scrap of you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just you wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his final threat hanging in the air, Fabian turned to leave, only to be met with Osborne's biting retort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered. "Fabian, give it a rest with the bragging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you're so tough? Your speed's like a crippled old lady's! What's the point of watching me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Waiting for me in the wild to strike?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! I'll be waiting&mdash;maybe I'll turn the tables and make you the dead one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're nothing special, a lousy Deity Overlord. If this is the best they can be, I'm severely disappointed. You're a disgrace!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I were you, with all that power and such pathetic skill, I'd have killed myself by now. Even a pig I raised could top your sorry self if it reached Deity Overlord!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Staring at me with those big eyes?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Big deal. If I were you, I'd hide from shame! A Deity Overlord warrior can't even take down someone fresh in Celestial Deity? How do you even live with yourself?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe you should bow to me, let me teach you a thing or two!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's caustic words only fueled Fabian's rage further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Fabian knew better than to engage in a futile verbal spar. He was a Deity Overlord who couldn't kill a mere Celestial Deity, and debating would only further his humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with Osborne's derision, no matter how enraged he became, there was nothing Fabian could do to retaliate. Unable to endure such taunts any longer, he channeled his fury into a burning fury within his chest. After casting one final, lingering glance at Osborne, he vanished swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian had been driven away by Osborne's insults!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne breathed a sigh of relief as he saw Fabian depart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though his words were filled with contempt for Fabian, the pressure Fabian had exerted was immense. It was only thanks to Thunderform Flash that he had managed to escape today's predicament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Fabian was finally gone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were safe now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne clasped his hands in a salute to Oswald. "Thank you, General Borden, for your intervention."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oswald looked at Osborne, his expression calm. "Lachlan, you don't need to thank me. It's part of my duty! Besides, if it weren't for your own prowess in using speed to toy with Fabian, today could have spelled disaster for you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your talent is impressive. Have you ever considered aligning yourself with me? If you pledge your loyalty, I'll ensure your protection, preventing Fabian from ever targeting you again. Moreover, I can move you from the Wild Flame Army to the City Guard, securing you a position as a chiliarch, or even a leader of ten thousand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To pledge allegiance was, in essence, to submit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, of course, could not agree. He replied calmly, "Thank you for your high regard, General Borden. But I prefer to rely on my own strength rather than aligning with anyone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oswald's brows furrowed at this response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a cold snort, a surge of divine power erupted from him, pressing down on Osborne with overwhelming force.</span></p></div>
