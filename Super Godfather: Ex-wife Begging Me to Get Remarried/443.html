        <h1>Chapter 443 The Wedding Day</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's inheritance ceremony and wedding were now in the final stages of preparation. The entire Paltrow Estate was adorned with festive decorations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ceremony was to take place on the mountain behind the Paltrow Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long ago, Alexander had broken through Class A here, triggering a terrifying thunderstorm that leveled the mountain peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Paltrows believed this thunder-struck mountain held great significance, so after some renovations, they transformed it into the main venue for Alexander's inheritance ceremony and wedding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On this day, the Paltrow family was filled with excitement and activity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of Dampston's high society had gathered. Those who received invitations were at least heirs or heads of top-tier families, and all eight of Dampston's ancient families sent prominent representatives to attend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition, more than twenty ancient families from neighboring states also sent people to witness the event.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, the Augustines were among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family was led by Brian, along with Nathan, Kaden, and Queenie, the strongest of the Augustine family's younger generation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they observed the bustling Paltrow family, their expressions were solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, do you think Osborne will show up? Where has he been lately?" Queenie couldn't help but ask in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's face was grim. "I have no clue where Osborne's been. Even Isaac has no idea. To be honest, I hope Osborne doesn't show up. I think he should stay away from the Paltrow Estate, or else..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian didn't finish his sentence, but everyone understood what he meant. Concern was written on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long ago, Osborne and Alexander had a duel, and due to sheer luck, Osborne ended up winning, causing Alexander a significant loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Paltrow family even had to forfeit a third-level ancient magic weapon to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was then they finally discovered that Clarissa, Alexander's supposed fianc&eacute;e, was actually Osborne's girlfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of this connection, Osborne and Alexander were destined to be enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had once told Alexander that he would come to the Paltrow Estate on the wedding day to take Clarissa away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, in turn, had sworn that if Osborne dared to come, he would kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the wedding day had finally arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne had been missing for more than ten days, and no one knew where he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope Osborne doesn't show up," Nathan muttered. "Alexander is too powerful! Ten days ago, he had just made a breakthrough, and his power was still unstable, which is why he lost to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Osborne shows up here, there will definitely be trouble. It's better if he stays away. Although it will be a bit embarrassing for the Augustines, at least Osborne will be safe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian nodded in agreement as he heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing someone approaching, he quickly added, "Alright, forget it. We're just here for the ceremony today. Once it's over, we're out of here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for Osborne, he has his own plans."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Brian led the group forward, smiling as they greeted the people ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in the Paltrow family study, Alexander was dressed in a luxurious outfit, with the Paltrow family's lightning emblem proudly displayed on his chest. Standing by the window, he gazed at the lively scene outside, feeling a surge of excitement. Today, he would officially become the head of the Paltrow family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, he would also marry the Radcliffe family's Fatebearer, Clarissa!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was his big day!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wade, have the Augustines arrived? What about Osborne, did he show up?" Alexander asked coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade scoffed, "The Augustines are here, led by Brian himself, along with a few younger generations. As for Osborne, he didn't show up. I guess he really doesn't have the guts to come."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So he truly doesn't dare?" Alexander muttered, a chilling smile playing on his lips. "It seems I overestimated him. But strangely, I'm a bit disappointed. I was planning to use him as an excuse to give the Augustines a hard time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade chuckled, "You can deal with the Augustines anytime. Today, your only job is to get through this ceremony without a hitch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded. "I know. Everything's set."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to their plans, Alexander would begin the inheritance ceremony at noon, when the sun was at its peak. He would first perform the rites to officially become the head of the Paltrow family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, the wedding would follow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the situation with the Radcliffe family? Any pushback from Clarissa?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes narrowed, a cold glint flickering in them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade gave a faint smile. "Eugen just called me. Everything is fine on their side. Clarissa hasn't resisted. She's already dressed in her wedding gown and will be ready to walk down the aisle as soon as the ceremony starts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Clarissa gives us any trouble, Eugen will personally step in to make sure the wedding goes through. They've guaranteed there won't be any surprises."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded. "Great!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't wait for this! Fate power... Once I've been baptized by its power, I'll evolve again and reach even greater heights!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about those classmates from the Power Prodigy Class?" Wade asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph! They used to look down on me. Once I've fully transformed, I'll crush them all and show them who the real genius is!" With those chilling words, Alexander headed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wade, the time is almost here. I'm going to prepare for the inheritance ceremony. After today, everything in Dampston will be under my command!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alexander proudly walked out of the study.</span></p></div>
