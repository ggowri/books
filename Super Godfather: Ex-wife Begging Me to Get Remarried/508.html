        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, how about you help me choose?" said Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled at Isa and said, "You're so skilled. You surely know which powers suit me better and will boost my strength more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa heard this and looked at Osborne with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want me to help with your own matters? Aren't you afraid I might choose something you won't like?" said Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pulled Isa into his arms and smiled. "You can choose anything. I trust you! I don't have a particular preference for any of my powers. Whatever you pick, I trust you," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa hesitated for a moment. "Alright, I'll really choose then," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First, spatial powers are one of the most powerful abilities. Since you've already mastered them, there's no reason to give them up. Spatial powers must be one of your main powers," said Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no reason for him to give up spatial powers. Even if Osborne had to choose himself, he wouldn't give them up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Second, you need a power with strong enough attack power that can continuously attack and has a wide range. This will be your main offensive means.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can choose between fire and thunder powers. I suggest you choose thunder because you've absorbed the Blessing of Thunder before. Your thunder power has already mutated, making it stronger than ordinary thunder powers," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thunder power? Okay!" said Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. He also thought that thunder power was suitable as his second main power. It was powerful enough and had a wide attack range.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, his thunder power was mutated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there a third one?" Osborne asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa hesitated for a moment. "Most metahumans can't even fully understand one power. </span><span>They can't master intermediate applications their whole life. Those who can master two main powers are rare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure you need a third main power?" said Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment but eventually nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll try first. If it's too difficult, I'll give up later," said Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa nodded. "Then I suggest you make psychic powers your third main power. Psychic powers are one of the most mysterious and hardest to defend against," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay!" said Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't hesitate and agreed immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial powers, thunder powers, and psychic powers. I'll choose these three as my main powers!" said Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes were full of anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked forward to mastering the intermediate and even advanced applications of these three powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for his other powers, he wouldn't give them up but wouldn't research them deeply. He would use them as support in certain situations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like his x-ray vision, and mind control power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like his wind elemental, water elemental, and fire elemental powers. They would only be used as support in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After deciding on his main powers, he naturally began his research.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it would be a long process. Without talent, one might never master intermediate power applications in their lifetime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Osborne decided to first learn advanced martial arts techniques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Learning more advanced martial arts techniques could immediately enhance his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let's start with Stretch Soft Force!" said Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa explained, "Stretch Soft Force and </span><span>Point Blank</span><span> Force counter each other. One is mainly for defense, while the other is for breaking through defenses. If Stretch Soft Force is stronger, it can block Point Blank Force. If Point Blank Force is stronger, it can pierce through Stretch Soft Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch closely for Stretch Soft Force," said Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa started teaching Osborne Stretch Soft Force. Osborne's strong comprehension skills quickly showed again. He soon mastered the basics of Stretch Soft Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Isa began to teach Osborne the Deadly Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This technique lets you hit a wall without damaging it but delivers a deadly blow to the enemy hiding behind it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deadly Force was extremely useful in certain situations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For example, even </span><span>Point Blank</span><span> Force couldn't break through if an enemy hidden in a secure, unbreakable safehouse. Deadly Force could easily take down the enemy inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another example was if the enemy had an extremely sturdy shield. Deadly Force could injure the enemy through the shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or if the enemy had strong energy defenses, Deadly Force could also be used.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, Deadly Force was very useful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne studied diligently. Isa taught with the same seriousness. She seemed determined to teach Osborne as much as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Ophelia was at the Caldwell Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's injuries had fully healed. Ever since she returned from the Alisa Ship, she had locked herself in her room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lay on her desk, staring at a delicate alarm clock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clock's hands slowly turned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tick!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tick!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every tick of the second hand marked another second passing in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia stared intently at the clock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a burst of strange energy shot from her eyes. In that moment, the whole world seemed to freeze. Even the second hand on the clock moved back slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then everything returned to normal, as if nothing had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ophelia's face had turned pale as if she had lost too much blood. She almost fainted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Isa, who was teaching Osborne, suddenly froze and stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked up at the sky. Her face was filled with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, what's wrong?" asked Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa took a deep breath. Her expression turned extremely serious. "The god who controls time has finally awakened!" she said.</span></p></div>
