        <h1>Chapter 892 Get Serious Too</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarlett chuckled coldly. "Looks like I overestimated you! Your tricks may work against weaklings, which is why you've racked up 99 consecutive wins. But when it comes to a real powerhouse, you're clearly out of your depth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's previous opponents had all been unable to match his sheer strength. His attacks were devastating; anyone who got hit by him was bound to be injured and </span><span>quickly defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Scarlett was a different story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her Plant Realm, her power surpassed his, and with her Realm at Level Three, Osborne found it nearly impossible to break through her defenses. She had the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If this is all you've got, then it's time for you to admit defeat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of her hand, the trees and vines in her Plant Realm sprang to life, launching a barrage of attacks from all directions, nearly overwhelming Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His martial art aura flickered under the relentless assault, leaving him with no choice but to defend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Scarlett vanished from her throne, slipping into Stealth Mode.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calmly, Osborne focused on warding off the incoming onslaught while activating his Satan's Eye, hoping to pinpoint Scarlett's location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his surprise, he couldn't find her anywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if she had completely disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not even his Satan's Eye could detect her presence, and Osborne felt no spatial fluctuations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Interesting," Osborne mused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all this time at the Honor Quest Ceremony, racking up 99 wins, he finally encountered a worthy opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne understood that Scarlett wasn't just boasting; her power was indeed formidable. Her position at number 100 in the Godson Rankings was simply a result of her being a killer who hadn't seriously pursued a higher rank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her current strength, she could easily contend for a spot in the top twenty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But do you really think you can take me down like this? You're underestimating me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could shatter Scarlett's Plant Realm, he could turn the tide of the battle. He had at least four options to achieve that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First, unleash a Realm more powerful than Scarlett's&mdash;his Light Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Second, resort to Brute Force to break through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Third, tap into his Vampire Transformation or the Breath of Celestial to boost his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fourth, harness the strength of his right leg's Divine Bone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he weighed his options, he realized his Light Realm had reached Level Four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he activated it, he could easily demolish Scarlett's Level Three Plant Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that was his trump card, and he didn't want to reveal it too soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most Class S experts hadn't mastered a Level Four Realm, and using it might draw unwanted attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's right leg's Divine Bone was also a last resort&mdash;his true ace in the hole that he couldn't afford to expose just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brute Force would cost him a significant amount of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With more than twenty challengers waiting behind Scarlett, each more formidable than the last, including Marlon, Osborne wanted to conserve his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, there was really only one option left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a low snort and said, "Scarlett, you've got some real skill. Since that's the case, I'll get serious too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vampire Transformation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne finished speaking, his body began to undergo a dramatic transformation. Terrifying power surged from the Blood Cross, merging seamlessly with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hair grew wildly, cascading into a flowing mane of blood-red strands that resembled streams of fresh blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two sharp fangs emerged from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fingers extended into long, dagger-like claws.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face turned pale and became more angular, accentuating his menacing appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne felt an exhilarating lightness in his body, yet an overwhelming surge of strength. With a single punch, he shattered the surrounding vines and trees with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His physical power had more than doubled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I'll blast apart your Plant Realm and force you out!" Osborne declared with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he unleashed his formidable power on Scarlett's Plant Realm, causing it to tremble violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The primal forest around him began to collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's strength was so formidable that even Scarlett's Plant Realm, which had reached Level Three and was a web of intertwined power, could not withstand it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, under the relentless assault from Osborne, the Plant Realm was on the brink of collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Osborne's Satan's Eye began to pulse wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strong sense of danger surged through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally decided to make a move, huh?" Osborne scoffed, quickly scanning for Scarlett's position to launch a counterattack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what he found left him stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing?"</span></p></div>
