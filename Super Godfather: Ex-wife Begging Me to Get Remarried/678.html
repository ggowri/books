        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could they do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was surprised that Vincent had killed two warriors from the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> who had reached Class AAA at the cost of serious injuries, and he had gained over three thousand points in two days, which Osborne could easily explain it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma and Matthew unexpectedly boosted more than two thousand points as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen had even improved his score by almost three thousand points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had thought he had the absolute upper hand in this heir selection and that there wouldn't be much doubt about what was to come, but it had taken only two days for the unexpected to reoccur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb said calmly, "They were also irritated by your points, so they all attacked back at the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>. Perhaps they were lucky enough that they didn't get sieged by the warriors who reached Class AAA, and they killed one person who had reached Class AAA and a number of people who had reached Class AA respectively."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Awesome," Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure enough, it's not that easy to complete Godfather's sixth test of the heir selection and become the first heir of the Augustine family. But </span><span>so</span><span> what if you guys catch up? After today, the first place will once again belong to me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, I will leave you all far behind me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the counterattack on </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, Osborne had the help of Clarissa and the assistance of the Blood Demon Organization, and the two elders who had reached Class AAA, Caleb and Janet, would also help him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was absolutely sure that he could kill a few more warriors from the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> who had reached Class AAA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, his points would rise so quickly that he would leave everyone behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, Osborne closed the Draco Star Wristlet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said calmly, "Caleb, how long are we away from the headquarters of the Draco Group in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"About four hours!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb replied, "Osborne, are you sure we would attack the headquarters in </span><span>Dampston</span><span> so openly? I showed you the news that Vincent had quit because I wanted to remind you that we should have been more careful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vincent and Declan were besieged and seriously injured by many of the warriors from the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> who had reached Class AAA, so he quit the heir selection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think we should be more careful. After all, the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' intelligence capabilities are no worse than ours. Our motorcade might have been discovered by them a long time ago, and they're bound to lay a trap waiting for us to fall into it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think we should look for an opportunity to sneak up on them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "A sneak attack will indeed be a good idea, but I won't be doing that this time. If I wanted to conduct a sneak attack, I wouldn't have brought members from the Blood Demon Organization out with me. This is their first battle, and I should just destroy them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>, which is our territory! Why do the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> attack openly, while our counterattack can only be a careful sneak attack?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's as if the Augustine family are afraid of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to completely destroy the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> this time! I want to end this war as quickly as possible in such a way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Osborne's eyes were filled with indifference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb and Janet looked at each other. They both hesitated, but neither of them ended up speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. I'll listen to you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope everything will go well!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At last, four hours had passed, and Osborne and the others were approaching the headquarters in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the neighborhood of the headquarters in </span><span>Dampston</span><span> was incredibly quiet, everyone within three miles of the square had been killed, and the area had become a forbidden zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Osborne sneered, "What a coincidence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone from the Blood Demon Organization, attack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Destroy them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without the slightest hesitation, Osborne gave the direct order to attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three attacking teams of the Blood Demon Organization immediately sprang into action, releasing their combat drones for reconnaissance and clearing the way with their combat robots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stepped out of the car and looked away from the headquarters in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, his eyes cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened Satan's Eye and saw clearly what was going on at the headquarters in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> might also know that the warriors of the Augustine family had Satan's </span><span>Eye, which was capable of a certain degree of perspective, so instead of hiding and sneaking up on them, he arranged a battle formation at the entrance to the headquarters in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sensed three incredibly powerful energies in it, and they looked incredibly familiar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first was Duke Medusa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next was Duke Titan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, it was Duke Werewolf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On top of that, there were at least a dozen Marquis Medusa, Marquis Titan, and Marquis Werewolves who had reached Class AA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the Count Medusa, Count Titan, and Count Werewolves who had reached Class A, there were even more, at least hundreds of them, and every one of them looked exactly the same, looking as if they were robots with creepy looks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three dukes who reached Class AAA? A dozen marquises who reached Class AA?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> guarding the headquarters in </span><span>Dampston</span><span> was formidable. With such strength and the sturdy defense of the headquarters in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, it was enough to ensure absolute safety under normal circumstances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three days ago, the Blood Demon Organization hadn't been established yet, and the power of the members hadn't improved yet, so Osborne definitely wouldn't choose to attack head-on and forcefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now...</span></p></div>
