        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't bother to lower his voice; instead, he </span><span>boomed</span><span> out his words, his voice dripping with menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone who dares to obstruct or compete, just kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His chilling declaration reached every ear in the vicinity, and his gaze swept icily toward the other ancient families of </span><span>Dampston</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Luther family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Walker family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Marion family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Hawthorne family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lingered on each of these four great families, all of whom, like the </span><span>Paltrows</span><span>, had ties to the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their power and influence in </span><span>Dampston</span><span> were considerable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with the </span><span>Paltrows</span><span> annihilated by Osborne's hand, their vast holdings were like a delectable cake left unguarded, tempting everyone to take a bite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These four families were the most likely to make a move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne had personally destroyed the </span><span>Paltrows</span><span>, and he had no intention of letting anyone else profit from their downfall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smirk played on his lips as he said, "If you don't want to end up like the </span><span>Paltrows</span><span>, then keep your hands to yourselves. Anyone who tries to grab what's not theirs will lose their hand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words left the members of </span><span>Dampston's</span><span> ancient families with grim expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The head of the Walker family, Shawn, couldn't help but sneer, "Osborne, you're being too domineering! Does the Augustine family intend to monopolize the Paltrow family's assets? You're showing utter disregard for the other ancient families of </span><span>Dampston</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words ignited the fury of the other ancient families present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! The Augustine family's ambition to monopolize the Paltrow family's assets is outrageous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think </span><span>Dampston</span><span> is under the Augustine family's control? That it's under your control, Osborne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> what if you're powerful? </span><span>So</span><span> what if you can annihilate the Paltrow family? If we, the ancient families, unite, we might not be afraid of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right, everyone has a share in the Paltrow family's assets!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the ancient families shouted, unfazed by Osborne's threats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you still have the mood to seize the Paltrow family's assets? You should be worried about yourself. You've offended the Powell family and the Hayes family of Newport City, bringing catastrophic disaster upon the Augustine family. If I were you, I'd immediately take the Augustine family and flee </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, even flee the country," Shawn said mockingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes narrowed slightly, fixated on Shawn with icy killing intent. "Mr. Walker, are you saying this because you want to compete with the Augustine family for the Paltrow family's assets?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn sneered, "I didn't say that. I'm just reminding you not to be too arrogant! </span><span>Dampston</span><span> is not under the control of the Augustine family, nor is it under your control, Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay for young people to be a little arrogant, but if they're too arrogant, they'll end up dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn's eyes were full of menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but laugh out loud. He said coldly, "Whether </span><span>Dampston</span><span> is mine or not, I don't know. But I do know that it's definitely not up to you, Shawn!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to fight for it, then come on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne suddenly tore open a dimensional rift and appeared in front of Shawn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he punched Shawn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn's face changed. He didn't expect Osborne to dare to attack him in front of so many people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he reacted quickly, immediately activating his power and creating layers of water waves in front of him, trying to block Osborne's fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, a loud noise came. Osborne instantly broke Shawn's defense, and the tremendous force hit Shawn, sending him flying and creating a massive crater in the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Walker!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Walker!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Walker family's faces changed drastically. They stared at Osborne angrily but didn't dare to make a move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked down at Shawn on the ground with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Walker, with just this little strength, you dare to challenge me? Now I'll ask you again! Does the Walker family want to compete with my Augustine family for the Paltrow family's assets?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Answer me, yes or no!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression was icy cold, his killing intent radiating outwards, striking fear into the hearts of everyone around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A single punch from Osborne defeated Shawn!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn was the head of the Walker family, their top fighter. Even though he was not a Class A+ metahuman yet, he was close. And he couldn't even withstand a single punch from Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wondered who could stand against Osborne in all of </span><span>Dampston</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked at Osborne, their eyes filled with a mix of wariness and terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn struggled out of the crater, his face pale, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth. His expression was dark, his face contorted with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But faced with Osborne's challenge, he could only clench his fists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very well!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you're powerful, so you have the final say! Today, the Walker family admits defeat! We will not fight for the Paltrow family's assets!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Shawn led the Walker family away, humiliation burning in their hearts. But as he turned, a cold glint flashed in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Walker family serving as a stark warning, the other ancient families of </span><span>Dampston</span><span> were terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Luther family also gives up its claim on the Paltrow family's assets!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Marion family withdraws as well!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, the ancient families of </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, cowed by Osborne's strength, announced their withdrawal from the contest for the Paltrow family's assets and departed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was left in awe of Osborne's might.</span></p></div>
