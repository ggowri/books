        <h1>Chapter 242 Devour Fire Elemental Essence</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His prowess had been impressive, no doubt, but he had faced Osborne, who was an even more formidable force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being only Class C+, Osborne had mastered four elemental essences and possessed level three Devil's Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This effectively bridged the gap between him and a Class B+ metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Osborne wielded the rare spatial power and could transform into a Vampire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most crucial factor was Zoe, his ally with divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under such circumstances, Derek's defeat was inevitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Derek's setup, any Class B+ metahuman would have met the same grim fate, unable to escape or counterattack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's arsenal was vast and varied, which had sealed Derek's doom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in death, Derek's body still held value for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His ocular energy flared, beginning to absorb Derek's fire elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, Osborne used Satan's Eye to devour Derek's fire elemental essence, making fire elemental power the sixth element in his repertoire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fire power!" Osborne exclaimed, stretching out his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A small flame ignited in his palm, burning fiercely without harming him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the tiny flame expanded into a raging inferno, engulfing a large area in front of him. It consumed all the bodies of the Chevalier family's elite, incinerating them </span><span>thoroughly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perfect!" Osborne murmured with satisfaction at his mastery over the flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, elemental powers alone couldn't match the Devil's Light after fusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Devil's Light represented the pinnacle of both offense and defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne contemplated when the time would be right to fuse the spatial and fire elemental essences into Devil's Light, further enhancing its power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could successfully merge them, his Devil's Light might break through to level five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What would a level five Devil's Light be like?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't know that. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Augustine family's millennia-long history, the most powerful practitioner had only achieved level four Devil's Light before exploding into oblivion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A level five Devil's Light had never been seen, so Osborne was eager to find out its potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it wasn't the right moment yet. He could feel that with his current power level was already at its limit. Attempting to fuse more elements could result in catastrophic failure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne needed to reach Class B metahuman status to continue advancing Devil's Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need to rush! After this battle, I can sense that I'm close to Class B. Perhaps soon, I'll be able to manifest my soul of powers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, Osborne turned his attention to the diamond mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This multi-billion-dollar asset was his now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the mine in his possession, Luna Jewelry would flourish, gaining access to top-quality diamonds and positioning itself as one of </span><span>Rosmandi's</span><span> leading jewelry companies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured, "Excellent! A mine of this scale must have a storage facility. Extracted diamonds are temporarily stored there before being shipped out periodically."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne decided to inspect the storage room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the jewelry industry, diamonds were the ultimate gem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No woman could resist their allure. Whether for an engagement or wedding, a diamond ring was almost a necessity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was eager to explore the sparkling treasures himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He and Clarissa had confirmed their relationship, but he had yet to give her any gifts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne planned to select a rough diamond, personally polish it, and present it to Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Additionally, Isa and Zoe had been instrumental in his success. So, Osborne wanted to reward them as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, the storage room is this way," Valentin said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly obtained the layout of the diamond mine and led Osborne to the storage area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door to the storage room swung open, revealing nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was completely empty, not a single diamond ore in sight. It was clear that the </span><span>Chevalier family had moved the diamonds not long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's disappointment was evident. "Looks like I'll have to find them myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Determined to dig out the diamonds, Osborne headed into the mine tunnels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his level four Satan's Eye, his X-ray vision was unparalleled. Even diamonds buried 16 to 30 feet deep wouldn't escape his detection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using Satan's Eye to search for diamond ore would be child's play.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sent Valentin to clean up the mess and cover their tracks while he ventured into one of the tunnels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This particular tunnel had been mined for some time, but according to the Chevalier family's records, it still held a wealth of untapped diamond ore with a significant daily output.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne reached the deepest part of the tunnel, he activated his Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once dark and opaque rock layers became transparent to his gaze, revealing the hidden diamond ore within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne exclaimed in awe, "No wonder this diamond mine is worth over 10 billion! Mining diamonds here is like picking up money!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of this valuable mine now belonging to him filled Osborne with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he wasn't interested in ordinary diamonds. He was on the hunt for the highest quality gems&mdash;large in size and exceptional in clarity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scanning the area with his Satan's Eye, Osborne suddenly caught a glimpse of a brilliant red glow deep within the rock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes widened as he focused on the fist-sized diamond emitting an eerie blood-red radiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could this be... a </span><span>blood diamond</span><span>?"</span></p></div>
