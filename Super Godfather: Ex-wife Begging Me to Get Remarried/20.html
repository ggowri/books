        <h1>Chapter 20 Keeping a Low Profile</h1>
        <div><p>Osborne replied calmly, “Because I’m still too weak. I’m not worthy of such an identity yet. They fear the Godfather, not me.”</p><p>“What’s the difference?” Debbe asked again.</p><p>Osborne smiled faintly and offered no explanation.</p><p>After experiencing the power of authority, he indeed felt exhilarated, but he didn’t lose his composure, as he knew that power was a double-edged sword that could harm him if not used properly.</p><p>Furthermore, Osborne now only wanted to pass more successor tests and secure higher authority to save Anastasia. He wasn’t interested in dealing with the flattery and currying favor of the high society.</p><p>Since no one knew what his next successor test would be, he figured that if he was too high-profile, it might affect his ability to complete it. Therefore, he needed to stay low-key.</p><p>Although this might lead to more challenges and trouble for Osborne, keeping a low profile was still the better choice.</p><p>“Okay, I’ll do as you say, Mr. Augustine.” Debbe didn’t ask any more questions and swiftly started organizing everything.</p><p>Soon after, Osborne arrived inside the auction house.</p><p>“Mr. Augustine, since you prefer to keep a low profile, I won’t accompany you. Besides, Ms. Radcliffe is about to arrive. She’s a distinguished guest, so I need to go attend to her,” Debbe said and then turned to leave.</p><p>“Ms. Radcliffe?” Osborne repeated.</p><p>Osborne murmured to himself and didn’t think much about it. He then found a corner and sat down to wait quietly.</p><p>Tonight’s auction was divided into two stages. One was a charity auction, and another was a treasure auction.</p><p>The charity auction hadn’t begun yet, but numerous prominent figures from Mayby City were already gathered, quietly discussing among themselves.</p><p>When they saw Osborne entering through the VIP passage, their eyes lit up.</p><p>However, they did not recognize him and did not dare to approach him, only quietly discussing and trying to find out who he was.</p><p>Osborne ignored them, as his sole purpose for being here was to bid on the longevity herb for Anastasia.</p><p>From his conversation with Debbe earlier, he had learned that two longevity herbs would be auctioned tonight, which eased his mind considerably.</p><p>Now, Osborne just needed to win the bids for both longevity herbs, and Anastasia would be saved.</p><p>He was willing to give up everything to save Anastasia, even if it meant spending all of the millions of dollars in his account and becoming penniless again. No matter who competed with him, he would fight to the end.</p><p>While thinking about this, Osborne began to practice The Breath of Celestial as he waited for the auction to officially start.</p><p>Just then, the members of the Caldwell family and the Ashford family finally entered.</p><p>They saw Osborne in the corner but did not dare to trouble him, as they were still unclear about why he had VIP status and did not want to act rashly.</p><p>Wesley stared intently at Osborne and asked with a grim expression, “Is that the loser Osborne?”</p><p>When Wesley thought about how Ophelia had once been Osborne’s wife, sharing a bed and having intimate moments, he felt a deep resentment toward Osborne. He would only feel at ease if Osborne were dead.</p><p>When Ophelia saw Wesley’s expression, she could roughly guess what he was thinking.</p><p>She nodded and said, “Yes, that’s Osborne, my ex-husband. But don’t worry. No one except the Caldwell family knows about our marriage. I will make sure the Caldwell family members keep it a secret.”</p><p>Wesley’s expression softened a bit, but he soon snorted and questioned, “What if Osborne decides to tell people himself?”</p><p>Ophelia was taken aback and frowned. “He… he probably won’t say anything. From what I know of him, he’s not the type to spread such things.”</p><p>“Oh, really?” Wesley didn’t believe her and responded. “Before you guys got divorced, he willingly stayed in your shadow and didn’t tell anyone about your relationship. But now that you’re divorced, are you sure he won’t say anything?”</p><p>Ophelia frowned and lost confidence in her own words.</p><p>Wesley said, “Ophelia, I don’t want our families’ union to become a topic of gossip. If you can’t ensure his silence, I will handle it my way. Only a dead man can keep a secret,” he declared, his words brimming with menace.</p><p>Ophelia opened her mouth as if to persuade him otherwise. However, after thinking about the importance of the Caldwell and Ashford family union, she just nodded in response.</p><p>“I’ll make sure he leaves Mayby City and never comes back,” she stated.</p></div>
