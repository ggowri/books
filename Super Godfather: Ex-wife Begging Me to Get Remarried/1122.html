        <h1>Chapter 1121 Ophelia Is the God of Time</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's shock was palpable as he stammered, "What... You... you're saying Ophelia is the God of Time? How is that even possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He struggled to wrap his head around it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Memories flooded back&mdash;how he had met Ophelia, fallen in love, married her, and then divorced her. How could he reconcile all that with the notion that she was the God of Time?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Ophelia is just an ordinary person!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before today, I never noticed anything special about her. How could she possibly be the God of Time that Isa has been searching for?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She's clearly been taken over by someone else!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Ophelia he knew felt completely different today&mdash;her demeanor, her expressions, even the way she spoke all seemed transformed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furrowing his brow, Osborne looked at Isa, seeking answers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa maintained her calm demeanor. "I know it's hard to believe, but she truly is the God of Time. Many years ago, Lord Malevolence led an army of Dark Deities to Celestara, and what followed was a cataclysmic battle that plunged the world into chaos. The very sky darkened, and countless gods were obliterated, leaving nothing but bones behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yet, some deities managed to survive through extraordinary means. Among them were the seven Deity Kings, who ultimately banded together to defeat and seal Lord Malevolence. They each wielded their powers to carve out a piece of Celestara as a sanctuary for life, accelerating time to help the inhabitants recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"During this tumultuous period, the God of Time was gravely injured by Lord Malevolence, her body shattered, leaving only her Divine Soul. In a desperate bid, she burned her Divine Soul to hasten the time of the Blue Planet hundreds of millions of time. Eventually, she could no longer hold on, and her Divine Soul crumbled, sending her memories into the cycle of reincarnation..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's expression turned solemn, her face reflecting a mix of reverence and gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Reincarnation with memories?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body tensed at the thought. Tales of reincarnation were woven into myths across the world. It was said that when a person died, they didn't simply vanish; rather, they entered a realm of judgment&mdash;heaven or hell&mdash;based on their deeds in life before eventually being reborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had always dismissed reincarnation as mere fantasy, yet here was Isa, telling him that the God of Time had entered the cycle of reincarnation with her memories intact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa said, her voice steady, "Exactly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The God of Time is a Deity King; how could she just die so easily? Even in her most perilous moments, she could choose to enter reincarnation, keeping her memories alive as she awaited her next life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, her memories are vast&mdash;far too much for an ordinary body to handle. Only upon reaching Class S would her memories begin to resurface!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If she reincarnates and fails to achieve Class S, her memories will remain dormant, and she'll drift through the cycles of reincarnation until, in one of her future lives, she finally attains Class S. Only then will the true God of Time be fully reborn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa fixed her gaze on Osborne, her eyes piercing through his confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you understand now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood there, stunned, murmuring to himself, "So you're saying that Ophelia is the reincarnation of the God of Time? The reason she seemed so ordinary before was that she hadn't yet regained her memories?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And now, she has finally broken through to Class S, and the memories of the God of Time have fully returned, making her the true God of Time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa nodded firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right! Ophelia is the God of Time, and the God of Time is Ophelia! But it's not just that she's broken through to Class S; thanks to the power of those five divine corpses, her strength has now reached the realm of true deities!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She is now a genuine god!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although she still has a long way to go to reach her former peak as a Deity King."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was left speechless, his mind racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder I've felt utterly outmatched in Ophelia's presence, beaten down without a glimmer of hope. She has fully regained her status as a true deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An existence beyond Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the weakest of gods will be far beyond my current capabilities."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia becoming the God of Time was not good news for him. Yes, she had regained her memories, which had transformed her personality, making her seem like a completely different person. However, the memories of "Ophelia" still influenced her actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew one thing for sure: Ophelia hated him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just now, the God of Time had wanted nothing more than to defeat him, to crush him beneath her heel, to make him regret every decision he'd ever made, even to kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't shake the feeling that it was Ophelia's memories that were driving those urges.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, with her newfound power, he was in deep trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a heavy sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa caught the sound and smirked. "What's the matter? Regretting your choices? Wishing you hadn't divorced her? After all, she's the God of Time, one of the seven Deity Kings from the Age of Gods!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's on the same level as my mentor, the God of Night! Funny enough, back in the day, the God of Time even had a crush on him!"</span></p></div>
