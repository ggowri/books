        <h1>Chapter 1195 Godly Level Beast</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait... what the hell?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression shifted dramatically as he laid eyes on the massive Dark Exotic Beast nest before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the cavernous lair, there were thousands of large black cocoons, each roughly 33 feet long. Dark Exotic Beasts crawled out of these sacks, unfurling their wings before soaring into the darkness above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beasts he had encountered earlier had clearly emerged from these very cocoons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the sheer number&mdash;over ten thousand&mdash;stunned him, the true source of his tense demeanor was the colossal cocoon positioned at the very center of the nest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This gargantuan pod dwarfed the others, measuring at least ten times their size.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A powerful pulsating energy radiated from that central cocoon, beating rhythmically like a heart, becoming stronger with each throb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that energy reeked of divinity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's up, Osborne? Why'd you suddenly freeze?" Anastasia asked, noticing his sudden stillness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his face grave, Osborne replied, "I've spotted the Dark Exotic Beast nest! There are at least 10 thousand beasts inside, with around ninety percent being ordinary Class S and about ten percent at the top-tier Class S level!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's eyes widened at the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ten thousand, you say? That's a lot! If we hadn't discovered them in time and they'd managed to escape, that would've been a disaster! I can only imagine how many cities would fall to their onslaught&mdash;mass casualties, chaos!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued, her energy shifting back to optimism, "Good thing we caught wind of them before it was too late!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, with your current strength, taking down 10 thousand Dark Exotic Beasts shouldn't be too tough, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her unwavering faith in Osborne beamed through her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had obliterated over a thousand Dark Exotic Beasts in a single blow before. Sure, there were ten times more here, but that equated to just ten strikes, didn't it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but chuckle humorlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt that Anastasia was totally underestimating the task at hand. Would 10 thousand beasts really fall to him in just ten moves?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't as simple as that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the world they inhabited, overwhelming numbers could tip the balance in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A top-tier Class S warrior, capable of taking down an average Class S with just a single stroke. Now, could this master fighter handle ten average Class S foes within the same short span of ten moves?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a scenario where a top-tier Class S warrior found themselves surrounded by ten average Class S fighters, it wouldn't just be a walk in the park to take them down in ten moves. In reality, merely emerging victorious against that many opponents would be a remarkable feat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The grim truth was that, in such a situation, the elite warrior could very well exhaust all their strength without managing to defeat a single foe. It wasn't unusual for ten ordinary Class S warriors to successfully take down even a top-tier one if they coordinated well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That said, ten thousand Dark Exotic Beasts? Osborne wasn't genuinely worried about that at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His prior feat of taking out a thousand beasts in one blow came down to their sheer numbers at the time, not any limitation on his abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What caused Osborne's real concern was the entity hidden within the massive cocoon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Is that a godlike beast? A Dark Deity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it's just a Junior Dark Deity or even an Intermediate Dark Deity, I wouldn't be too worried; I could handle them&mdash;maybe even take them down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if it's a Superior Dark Deity... now that would be a whole different ball game!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't entirely sure how powerful he was at this point, but the gulf between godly warrior levels was immense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't be certain whether he could go toe-to-toe with a Superior Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So Osborne told Anastasia and Zoe candidly, "There's definitely a Dark Deity in there. I can't gauge its strength for sure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia and Zoe exchanged worried glances, their expressions clearly somber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they stood there, thoughts raced through their minds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Dark Deity? That sounds terrifying! Sure, Osborne may have ascended to godhood, but he's still fresh into it. We have no clue just how strong he truly is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anxiety creased Anastasia's brow. "Osborne, we need to get out of here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've just become a god&mdash;going up against a Dark Deity is a gamble we can't afford right now! I refuse to let you take that risk! We should gather more warriors to tackle this together, not face it alone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely! Let's make a run for it!" Zoe chimed in, her tone urgent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mind raced as he weighed their words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No way!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That Dark Deity hasn't emerged from that massive cocoon yet, which means it's not at full strength! This is the perfect time to take it down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If we leave now and allow it to regain its power, with thousands of Dark Exotic Beasts at its side, we might as well be signing our own death warrants!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, if they break free from this underground lair, the devastation they'd unleash upon humanity would be catastrophic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We can't let that happen!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Determination burned in Osborne's eyes as he added, "Anastasia, Zoe, it's not fully awake yet. This is our shot to eliminate it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But with you two here, I can't go all out. Here's the plan. I'll lead you both back to safety and then come back to take care of this Dark Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trust me, if things go south, I'm confident I can slip away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just listen to me!"</span></p></div>
