        <h1>Chapter 525 Shocking Reward</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's expression hardened instantly as he thought, "Could it be that the reward for the fifth heir test is finally about to be revealed?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, the crowd continued their heated discussions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They were debating who from Dampston's Augustine family should attend Godfather's 80th birthday celebration. To them, Godfather was like a living legend, a figure of immense reverence and authority.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No one expected that in just a few days, they would become relatives of Godfather and be able to attend his birthday party.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone wanted to personally visit Newport City and meet the legendary Godfather.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amidst the commotion, each person was fiercely competing for the honor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You all carry on with your discussions. I have some matters to attend to, and I'll join you later," Osborne announced before quickly departing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He retreated to his room, locking the door behind him. Taking a deep breath, he turned his attention to the Draco Star Wristlet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was eagerly anticipating the reward for completing the fifth heir test.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The first reward was related to Satan's Eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After passing the fifth heir test, Osborne had finally received the method to elevate Satan's Eye to level six.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Absorb star power for seven days?" Osborne murmured to himself, studying the instructions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The process for advancing Satan's Eye to level six seemed astonishingly simple. There was no need for rare materials or complex procedures; he only had to perform the ritual every midnight facing the North Star, channeling the power of the stars into Satan's Eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After seven days, it would naturally reach level six.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is it really that simple?" Osborne furrowed his brow, skeptical.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it were truly so easy, then it wouldn't be so rare for members of the Augustine family to achieve level six.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knew well that only a few extraordinary talents like Vincent, Matthew, and Owen had managed to reach this level among the younger generation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Satan's Eye reaching level six can't be this straightforward. Since Godfather didn't elaborate, I'll have to figure it out myself," Osborne murmured, shifting his focus to the second reward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The second reward was a staggering sum of five billion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While this amount of wealth was formidable, it no longer stirred any emotional response in Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To him, money had become just a number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What he craved was power, influence, and strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Besides buying supplies from Draco Group's store, he had little use for such vast sums.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With Luna Jewelry and Skyefall Security Services continuously generating income for him, money no longer held any appeal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His attention turned to the third reward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Historically, Godfather had rewarded him with companies, industries, or prestigious positions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For instance, completing the second heir test had earned him Luna Jewelry, the third had brought Skyefall Security Services, and the fourth had made him the heir position of Dampston's Augustine family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What will this reward be?" Osborne wondered, scanning the details.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyes widened in shock as he read aloud, "Reward Three: Training Base No. 6?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Additional Information: The base currently houses 20 Class A or higher instructors, and 500 students above Class B about to graduate, including 60 Class B+ students, 430 Class A- students, and 10 Class A students. They will be absolutely loyal to you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Godfather had granted him an entire training base.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What stunned Osborne the most was the sheer scale of the training base. Inside, there were 20 Class A or higher instructors and 500 graduating trainees, each at least Class B+, with most being Class A- and a few Class A.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And these people would be utterly loyal to him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne took a deep breath, trying to calm his racing mind. He couldn't help but wonder why Godfather was bestowing such a massive contingent of loyal followers upon him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was a force capable of waging a war.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he had possessed Training Base No. 6 earlier, sweeping through Dampston would have been a walk in the park.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Twenty Class A or higher instructors would be a game-changer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The nine ancient families of Dampston combined had fewer than 20 Class A individuals.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This kind of power was overwhelming!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, for Osborne, this might not be such a blessing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "Godfather must be giving me this many assistants because the next heir's test is going to be incredibly challenging. Godfather clearly thinks that with my current strength, I wouldn't stand a chance at completing the upcoming test without this support."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The gravity of the situation hit Osborne hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "How difficult could the sixth test be to warrant such an extensive preparation?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is a full-scale war on the horizon?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as these thoughts swirled in his mind, the Draco Star Wristlet buzzed again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's expression hardened as he realized the sixth test was about to commence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He took another deep breath and opened the Draco Star Wristlet once more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's see what the sixth heir's test really entails," Osborne muttered, bracing himself for whatever lay ahead.</p></div>
