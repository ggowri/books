        <h1>Chapter 1031 Shocked Bryce</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're dead meat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the remaining over fifty-one Class S clones finally snapped into action, their furious roars echoing in unison. Their eyes were ablaze with murderous intent, all of them zeroing in on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fifty-one Class S clones launched a coordinated attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer force of it was terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Osborne's Light Realm had reached Level Four, it crumbled under their assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It held for just a breath, but that was all he needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had bought himself just enough time. As the Light of Redemption enveloped Bryce, a single breath was all it took for him to fully recover and regain his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce opened his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could take in his surroundings, he saw the swarm of fifty-one Class S clones charging toward him, panic flooding his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell! Didn't we agree they wouldn't kill me? They were supposed to take me alive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are they suddenly trying to kill me?" Bryce shouted. His voice tinged with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Clarkson, they're after me! Don't just stand there&mdash;help me out!" Osborne called back, urgency lacing his tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The combined onslaught from the fifty-one clones was far beyond what he could handle. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, Osborne could take each of them down quickly in a one-on-one fight, but together? That was a different story entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even top-tier Class S fighters like Gerardo, Sin, and Crimson wouldn't dare face an onslaught from over five hundred Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only option was to retreat and dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt the same urge to back off and evade, but in his attempt to save Bryce, he had already stepped into the trap, surrounded by enemies. With the clones coming at him from all sides, his only choice was to defend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His martial art aura surged to its maximum capacity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Bryce was quick to respond. Hearing Osborne's shout, he instantly </span><span>grasped the situation&mdash;it was Osborne who had come to rescue him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment to waste, he sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Osborne and Bryce threw everything they had into their defenses, but the combined might of fifty-one Class S clones was overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's martial art aura shattered under the relentless barrage, and the attacks slammed into him with brutal force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood sprayed from Osborne's mouth as he felt his insides take a severe beating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to the martial art aura absorbing some of the impact, and with Bryce sharing the burden, he was merely injured rather than outright killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, Osborne pulled out a Crystal of Life, quickly absorbing its vitality to mend his wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rich energy flowed through him, rapidly healing his injuries. While it wasn't as fast as the Light of Redemption, it worked quickly enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at Bryce, who looked worse for wear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Osborne had absorbed most of the clones' attacks, he didn't possess the same robust martial art aura and was sent flying from the force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every bone in Bryce's body felt like it had shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Bryce cursed, his body twitching from the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasted no time, shoving a Crystal of Life into Bryce's hands. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Clarkson, absorb the vitality and recover! Then help me hold off twenty of them. Together, we can take them down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne charged forward, determination blazing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could no longer afford to play defense; they had to go on the offensive for an opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, no Crystals of Life would be enough to heal him in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's do this!" Osborne shouted as he launched himself into the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce stared in confusion at the Crystal of Life in his hand, thinking, "What the hell? At a critical moment, Osborne gives me a ruby? And a low-quality one? As the pirate lord of </span><span>Likreia</span><span> Mountain, ruler of an entire sea, I wouldn't touch this piece of junk!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, he considered tossing it aside, but then Osborne's words echoed in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absorb the vitality to recover?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curiosity piqued, he decided to give it a shot. As Bryce attempted to absorb the vitality, he was instantly taken aback. A torrent of vibrant energy surged from the seemingly worthless "ruby" into his body, rapidly healing his injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Holy crap, this is a gem!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within moments, many of his wounds had healed, and he felt much better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as he was about to regroup, he noticed Osborne was struggling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Clarkson! Stop daydreaming and help me hold off twenty of those bastards, or we're both dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce snapped to attention, watching as Osborne went on the offensive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But despite his brave efforts, he was quickly pushed back. The relentless assault from the fifty-one Class S clones was overwhelming; they were just too powerful for Osborne to handle right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce's complexion turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold off twenty of them? Are you overestimating me? They're all Class S while I've barely scraped by into this tier!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even as he grumbled, his body acted faster than his brain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Bryce leaped into action. After all, there were still fifty-one Class S clones out there. Even if he managed to handle twenty of them, Osborne would still have to contend with thirty-one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Osborne is still a Class AAA, but I'm Class S now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he can step up, then why can't I? Worst case, I take my last stand here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm going down swinging!"</span></p></div>
