        <h1>Chapter 1046 Anger-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Osborne in the Human Slave culture tank, Ophelia was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could it be him?" She thought she had seen it wrong, so she quickly came to the culture tank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under her control, everything around her was in a static state. A dozen people in white coats were like statues. Osborne, in the culture tank, was motionless, with a painful expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's really him!" Ophelia saw Osborne's face and became angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia would never forget Osborne's condescending and indifferent look when Evelyn went to ask him for help because Ophelia was seriously injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia hated Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the very beginning, Osborne was just an orphan, and Ophelia was the young lady of the Caldwell family. She had always thought Osborne was lucky enough that she took a fancy to him and married him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Ophelia became the heir of the Caldwell family, she thought Osborne was no longer worthy of her. So, she divorced him, and she had never thought she was wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after they divorced, Osborne changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man who had always been cautious and submissive in front of Ophelia suddenly became different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne became excellent and powerful...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, Osborne's status even far surpassed hers. Ophelia regretted it and found that she still loved Osborne, so she decided to win him back. However, he responded to her with indifference, disdain, and contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia hated that feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when she was dying, Osborne did not consider their past feelings. He ignored </span><span>her and refused to save her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Ophelia hated Osborne and wanted to take revenge on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia wanted to become more powerful than Osborne, then appear in front of him in a superior manner and make him regret it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In order to achieve this, she worked hard to improve her strength and even took Gerardo, whom she hated, as her teacher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long ago, Ophelia finally broke through to Class AAA. She thought she could wreak vengeance on Osborne soon. As long as she broke through Class S, she would come to Osborne in the most stunning way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia was looking forward to seeing Osborne's shocked look when he saw her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she never expected Osborne to be actually in the base of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo actually put Osborne into the Human Slave culture tank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why is it him? Mr. Aniston, you actually want to turn him into a Human Slave! Why?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia was in a rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Gerardo's disciple, Ophelia knew very well about the function of the Human Slave culture tank. Every one of those who came out of the culture tanks was enslaved, and they only listened to Gerardo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their bodies, minds, and souls would all be enslaved by Gerardo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Human Slaves would lose their self-awareness and even most of their memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, if Osborne had been enslaved, there was a great possibility that he could never recognize Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia didn&rsquo;t accept it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne became a Human Slave, he would become "the walking dead", no longer recognize Ophelia or remember their past. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, what was the point of all her efforts?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if she became more powerful than him, her revenge would be no use.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia was furious, not because of Osborne, but because of Gerardo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo knew very well that what Ophelia wanted to do most was to take revenge on Osborne, but he still secretly tried to made Osborne into a Human Slave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia would never let it happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at Osborne coldly and snorted, "Humph! Osborne, you are so arrogant. But in the end, Mr. Aniston caught you, and you are about to be transformed into a Human Slave.</span></p></div>
