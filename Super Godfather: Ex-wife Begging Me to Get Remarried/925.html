        <h1>Chapter 925 Top Class S Powerhouse's Strength</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take care of the elders from the Augustine family! Leave Osborne to me!" Everett declared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he launched his attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A casual wave of his hand unleashed a terrifying force that erupted in front of Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way for Osborne to dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He barely had time to summon his martial art aura for protection before the onslaught hit him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was sent flying, the martial art aura flickering dimly around him as his face drained of color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn, he's strong!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Osborne's first real encounter with a top-tier Class S fighter, and he quickly realized that the power he faced was far beyond what he could handle at the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, Osborne could unleash his trump cards to defeat or even kill an average Class S, but against someone like Everett, he was outmatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett, seeing that Osborne had managed to block his attack without sustaining injuries, raised an eyebrow in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered, saying, "Looks like you've got some skills after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In that case, I'll just have to put in a little more effort to take you down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Everett charged at him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes flashed with determination. "You want to kill me? You'll pay a heavy price for that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a heartbeat, he vanished from sight, reappearing right behind Everett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Channeling the power of his Divine Bone, he delivered a fierce kick aimed at Everett's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett could have dodged, but he didn't even flinch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression was one of icy confidence; he didn't see Osborne's attack as a threat. After all, Osborne was just a Class AAA&mdash;a mere youth. How could he possibly pose a danger?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a casual punch, Everett met Osborne's attack head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact sent Osborne sprawling, but Everett's expression hardened as he felt a tremendous force surge through him, threatening to explode from within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett staggered back, a surprised grunt escaping him as a trickle of blood appeared at the corner of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you just hurt me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shock washed over Everett's face as he stared at Osborne, who was now reeling from the blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes turned cold, locking onto Osborne. "Not bad. I underestimated you. If you can hurt me as a Class AAA, I can only imagine the chaos you'd wreak if you ever broke into Class S!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Prepare to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fury ignited within Everett, and his wariness of Osborne reached a boiling point. If Osborne survived and continued to grow, the entire League of Divine Descent would have sleepless nights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Everett's attacks turned ferocious. He treated Osborne as a worthy adversary. He unleashed his full power, intent on crushing Osborne into submission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the relentless assault, Osborne found himself unable to defend, let alone counterattack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only focus on survival, but even that was proving difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood spewed from his mouth as he struggled to hold on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperate, Osborne activated Light of Redemption, but even that was just a temporary reprieve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wouldn't change the tide of battle; it merely extended his time in the fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! Time to go down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett's eyes glinted with determination as he landed another brutal punch on Osborne, aiming to finish him off for good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was on the brink of collapse, barely holding himself together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, a massive gray bear apparition suddenly materialized in front of him, blocking Everett's strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I'm here to help!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's figure appeared, wielding the Swallow Shield, ready to absorb the brunt of Everett's attack for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression tightened, anxiety washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Emma! Stay back! It's too dangerous here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett was far too powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma, though a top-tier fighter among the younger generation&mdash;stronger than most of the Augustine family elders&mdash;was still no match for a peak Class S like Everett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with her formidable Swallow Shield, she wouldn't be able to withstand his onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, when Everett unleashed his attack, it struck the Swallow Shield, causing Emma to gasp as her face paled dramatically. Blood trickled from the corner of her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I won't leave! I'm here to help you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma wiped the blood away and stood firm; her Swallow Shield raised in front of Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he looked utterly defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma knew she couldn't hope to beat Everett, but she couldn't stand by and watch as he slaughtered Osborne because Osborne was her man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on!" Emma shouted defiantly, directing her fury at Everett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smile crept onto Everett's face. "A volunteer for death? Ha! Due to certain... reasons, I can't kill Osborne myself, but I'm more than happy to leave him heavily injured. As for you? No mercy! Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, Everett struck again. The sheer gap in their strengths made it effortless for him to break through the Swallow Shield's defenses. His overwhelming power crashed down on Emma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She coughed violently, blood spraying from her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in horror.</span></p></div>
