        <h1>Chapter 534 Shutting Himself off From Visitors</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Osborne finished speaking, Henry's face was a mask of fury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne, however, barely registered his reaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne turned his attention to John. Waving his energy pistol with a smirk, Osborne said, "Still itching for another round, are you? Step up if you're game. Don't waste my time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As long as you're willing to put up the resources, I'm game for however many matches you want."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">John was fuming, ready to charge back into the fray, but his men from the Clifford branch bloodline held him back firmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. John Augustine, don't be rash!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's just trying to provoke you. Don't fall for it! The resources from the main bloodline are too valuable to squander any more."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. John Augustine, stay calm!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's not as simple as he seems. Without a solid guarantee of victory, there's no need to play the fool. Besides, he's already crossed Ms. Evelynn Augustine of the main bloodline. Mr. Owen Augustine has promised there'll be consequences. Someone will deal with him soon enough."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd's reassurances finally brought John back to his senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though he was still seething, he knew they were right. Osborne's strength was no joke, and even with thorough preparation, there was no certainty of victory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "I'll see how things pan out,"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">John said coldly, glaring at Osborne, "Don't get too full of yourself. Today we were careless, and we accept that. But you've made an enemy of Evelynn from the main bloodline, and word is out for you. You're not going to have an easy time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We'll see."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">John then swiftly led his men out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Henry, equally cold, declared, "Osborne, your victory is unearned. You'll never make me bow down. When the Branch Bloodline Competition comes, I'll be the first to take you down. Mark my words!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Henry then took his leave as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On Arena Number Nine, only the Dampston Augustine family remained. Nathan, Queenie, Yulissa, and the others were buzzing with excitement, their eyes full of admiration as they looked at Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, you were incredible!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Those two were so arrogant, and you took them down so decisively. No one will underestimate the Dampston Augustine family again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Absolutely, that felt so good!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The group clustered around Osborne, thrilled by the victory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Osborne doused their enthusiasm with a cold splash of reality. "Are you all so pleased? What's there to celebrate? They're Class A+ but just heirs of their respective branch bloodlines. Each branch still has stronger figures.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And what about us, the Dampston Augustine family? Excluding me, who among you is capable of standing up to them? None of you are even Class A yet!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I were to leave one day, who among you could hold up the Dampston Augustine family? Who among you could be a pillar?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's words struck the group like a bucket of ice water. They were left in stunned silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nathan spoke up hesitantly, "Osborne, you're the heir to the Dampston Augustine family. How could you leave us? With you leading us, that's more than enough."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as Nathan finished, Osborne shot him a fierce glare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What did you just say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nathan was startled, the intensity of Osborne's gaze making him raise his hands in surrender.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, we get it! We're sorry! We'll hit the books and train harder, and we'll make sure to break into Class A as quickly as possible to be your support!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The rest of the group, equally intimidated, dared not breathe a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne snorted disdainfully, saying, "Remember this: relying on others is never as reliable as relying on yourself. Strength is everything. Only by becoming stronger can you truly stand your ground. I could leave the Augustine family in Dampston at any time. You all need to work your tails off to improve yourselves. Even if one day I'm no longer around, don't let anyone look down on the Dampston Augustine family. Hold it together no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now, get going. Back to your training!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Osborne led his entourage away from Challenge Peak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once back at the Ninth Estate, he immediately informed everyone that he would be shutting himself off from visitors for the next few days to focus on intensive training.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He locked himself in his room and began his regimen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With several blood diamonds in his possession, Osborne held one of them tightly, absorbing its unique energy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His soul of powers was already fully integrated with his body, so Osborne only needed to harness the energy from the blood diamonds to enhance his physical form, which in turn would elevate his soul of powers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This made his training process much simpler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this stage, he had just crossed into Class A and was still some distance away from Class A+.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Osborne was confident that once he absorbed the energy from these blood diamonds, he would definitely reach Class A+ and might even come close to Class AA.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That level of power would ensure his position in Newport City's Augustine family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although he had easily defeated Henry and John, he wasn't about to get cocky. Osborne knew that many members of the main bloodline of the Augustine family in Newport City were far stronger than them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even among the younger generation in the branch bloodlines, there were plenty who were stronger than those two.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, the Clifford and Narciso branch bloodlines were among the weakest in the Augustine family branch bloodlines.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other five branch bloodlines' heirs were sure to be even more formidable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "I'd better keep a low profile for now. Owen and Evelynn, even if they want to target me, are bound by the family rules and can't just barge in here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With my current strength, I'm no match for Owen. I'll need a few days of training before I can think about that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Besides, starting tonight, I can begin absorbing star power to level up Satan's Eye to level six!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With these thoughts in mind, Osborne immersed himself in his training.</p></div>
