        <h1>Chapter 367 Finalizing the Plan</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A large-scale auction?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin murmured, "That certainly could work. The guests at an auction are all high-end individuals and affluent members of high society with considerable spending power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But a typical auction might not be enough to lure them aboard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Osborne's face was all smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "What if I put up top-tier jewelry like the Crown of Fate and Divine Favor Crown for auction? Would that be enough to draw them onto the ship?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stunned, Austin replied, "You have more of those top-tier jewels?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, casually retrieving two fist-sized diamonds from his Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These diamonds were left behind after the energy was absorbed from blood diamonds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had minor flaws, unlike the perfect diamonds on the Crown of Fate and Divine Favor Crown, but they were still invaluable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alison, seeing the diamonds in his hand, was nearly breathless with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, let me craft these diamonds. I promise to create top-tier jewelry that no woman in the world could resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just with the right promotion, featuring them as auction items will surely attract wealthy women from all over the world."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne agreed with a nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I trust you with this task. In fact, I was going to ask you to design not only these two sets of top-tier jewelry but also some slightly more common pieces to enrich our offerings and attract a wider range of people."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Excitedly, Alison nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Mr. Augustine. There are plenty of raw materials in Luna Jewelry. We have an endless supply of Imperial Green, glassy diamonds, amethyst, and various diamonds. I've already directed our designers to create a range of jewelry at different levels using these materials.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can definitely hold a specialized jewelry auction. If it goes well, the name of Luna Jewelry will be known throughout the world."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but chuckle at her enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hosting a specialized jewelry auction of Luna Jewelry's pieces on the Augustine family's cruise ship would solve the cruise's guest shortage and elevate the company's reputation and wealth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Osborne would be the biggest beneficiary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Austin furrowed her brows, concerned. "Osborne, are you really considering holding a jewelry auction at sea? With top-tier pieces as the main offerings?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne confirmed with a nod and asked, "You think it's a bad idea?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not bad, but I'm worried."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin admitted, biting her lip, "Do you realize how irresistible top-tier jewelry crafted with such massive diamonds is? If the auction is held at sea, I worry it might attract many with ill intentions, ready to seize them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, there's a lawless nature to international waters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words made Alison's expression shift, her brow creasing with concern as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, just smiled, "What if we collaborate with the Draco Group and have them oversee the auction? Would anyone dare to interfere then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin was taken aback, responding without hesitation, "If the Draco Group is involved and overseeing the auction, no one will dare to interfere unless they have a </span><span>death wish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the Draco Group is so prestigious. Would they even consider collaborating with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry about that. I have connections," Osborne said confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Draco Star Wristlet now bore four illuminated stars, signifying his high-level access within the Draco Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was confident he could arrange a partnership between the Draco Group's auction house and the Augustine family, with the Draco Group presiding over the maritime auction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just getting in touch with Debbe should suffice! Debbe heads the Draco Auction. She should have the necessary authority. If not, I can reach out to Ms. Hernandez."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had decided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have no objections, then. If this plan goes off without a hitch, it will be a win for everyone! The Augustine family's cruise business will surely bounce back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you'll be the biggest winner!" Austin finished, looking at Osborne with newfound admiration, her eyes sparkling with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, she blushed somewhat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, she felt an urge to throw herself into Osborne's arms, but with Alison present, she had to keep her emotions in check.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alison didn't linger and hurried back to the headquarters of Luna Jewelry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had to finalize the design of the top-tier jewelry swiftly and kick off the promotion to make sure wealthy women worldwide were aware of these exquisite pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the Augustine family could announce their collaboration with the Draco Auction, highlighting a major maritime auction featuring a collection of premier jewelry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To participate in the auction, they would have to purchase a ticket for the Augustine family's cruise, securing their eligibility to bid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This strategy would undoubtedly cause a frenzy for the cruise tickets, attracting celebrities and the wealthy from around the globe and effectively resolving the Augustine family's predicament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Alison left, Austin promptly got up, walked to the door, and locked it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning back to Osborne, she gazed at him with a mix of shyness and desire. "Osborne, seems I still haven't conceived your baby. Perhaps you have to try a little harder today."</span></p></div>
