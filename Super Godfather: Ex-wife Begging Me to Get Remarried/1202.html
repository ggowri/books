        <h1>Chapter 1201 Destroyed Cities</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's words sent a jolt through Osborne, his expression shifting dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without saying much more, Sebastian sent him a video.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly opened it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing the sudden change in his demeanor, Anastasia and Zoe hurried over to see what was going on. The three of them gathered closely, their eyes glued to the screen as the footage began to play.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the video unfolded, their faces paled in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless massive Dark Exotic Beasts surged into view, blocking out the sun as they roared, charging into a sprawling city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The military forces trying to fend them off unleashed a relentless barrage of bullets, but it was utterly futile. The beasts brushed off the gunfire like it was nothing, tearing through the soldiers, ripping tanks and armored vehicles apart as if they were mere toys.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer power of these creatures was terrifying; even artillery shells only managed to scratch the surface of their thick hides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It became painfully clear&mdash;these were all Class S beasts or higher, numbering in the tens of thousands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart sank as he recognized the city under siege.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a place that anyone in the world could name without hesitation&mdash;Lafier City!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bustling capital of Yalynch and the epicenter of global finance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The video showed Dark Exotic Beasts wreaking havoc, leaving a path of destruction in their wake. Bridges collapsed, roads crumbled, and iconic skyscrapers toppled, their familiar silhouettes reduced to rubble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic erupted among the citizens of Yalynch, who fled in every direction, screaming in terror. But the Dark Exotic Beasts were relentless, chasing down the fleeing masses, tearing them apart, devouring them whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a scene from hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Human resistance crumbled under the weight of the onslaught. In a city of over ten million, there was no effective defense to be found.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What shocked Osborne the most was the sudden appearance of a colossal beast soaring above the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It resembled a lion but with a single horn atop its head, crackling with arcs of lightning. Its massive body stretched an astonishing one hundred yards long, radiating a terrifying presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thunderous roar, the horn unleashed an explosive surge of lightning that engulfed Lafier City, transforming it into a stormy sea of electric chaos. In an instant, everything was obliterated, leaving behind only charred remnants and desolation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the storm subsided, Lafier City, once bustling with life, lay eerily silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not a single human remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if the city had become a ghost town, a graveyard of memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The video ended, but soon after, a second, third, and even fourth video arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each one depicted a different city falling to the same fate: Marcelin's Harbino City, Ransford's Denferes City, and Easionand's Mayano City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In each clip, the same relentless tide of beasts surged through the streets, overwhelming the military and any superpower that dared to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dark Deity made its appearance, showcasing its devastating power, effortlessly reducing these once-thriving metropolises to ruins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The survivors were few and far between.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the last video faded to black, Osborne, Anastasia, and Zoe were left in stunned silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged glances, their eyes reflecting a mix of horror, anger, and an unsettling sense of luck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lafier City in Yalynch, Harbino City in Marcelin, Denferes City in Ransford, and Mayano City in Easionand were the capitals of their respective nations, each a renowned metropolis with populations in the millions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they were all laid waste by the Beast Tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dark Exotic Beasts and the Dark Deity amidst the Beast Tide were far beyond what any nation's army or superpower could hope to stop; it was nothing short of a massacre.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if a nuclear bomb were dropped over a city, it wouldn't cause the sheer scale of destruction and loss of life that this Beast Tide had unleashed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was indeed a catastrophe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tens of millions perished within the Beast Tide. While they weren't citizens of Rosmandi, they were still living beings, slaughtered in sheer terror by the relentless onslaught of the beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Osborne and the others not feel outraged?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chill ran down their spines at the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This outbreak of the Beast Tide could have easily struck Newport City in Rosmandi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Osborne had taken proactive measures. He had wiped out the half a million Ferocious Beasts in the Lostridge Mountains ahead of time and exterminated all the Dark Exotic Beasts lurking in the fissures of Herbmaster Canyon. He even dealt with the Dark Deity itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't, the consequences could have been catastrophic. In short order, that Dark Deity could have marched on Newport City with thousands of Class S Dark Exotic Beasts and an army of over half a million Ferocious Beasts at its back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that point, Newport City would have ended up just like Lafier City in Yalynch, Harbino City in Marcelin, or Denferes City in Ransford&mdash;reduced to ruins, with millions dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne closed the video, a grave expression clouded his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Dark Deities are starting to resurrect. Who knows how many will come back? This world is spiraling into chaos!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need to get back to Newport City!"</span></p></div>
