        <h1>Chapter 1431 Give Tit for Tat</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You, a pathetic human, think you deserve to challenge me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey's voice dripped with cold arrogance, causing the onlookers to snicker derisively at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces were painted with mockery and contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey's words echoed their unspoken thoughts: how ridiculous it was for a pathetic human to dare argue with them, the so-called noble races.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're a disgraceful human. The esteemed Lord Malevolence has shown you enough mercy by not wiping your kind out completely. He's even given you a chance to join the Dark Deity Legion! And yet, you want the same treatment as us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elroy insulted you, so you should just take it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you dare fight back, you'll face the consequences! If you can't handle that, then get lost! Go back to your pitiful Human Community and live like the worthless miners you are!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laughter erupted from the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still refusing to admit your mistake? Do you even realize how lowly your Human Community status is? Today, Mr. Alick will make sure you understand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kneel down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several squad leaders chimed in, their voices dripping with disdain as they berated Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey added coldly, "Admit your fault, you miserable human. If you're sincere, I might consider forgiving you for laying a hand on Elroy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but smirk at the suggestion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Sincere?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forgive me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jeffrey, you're basically saying that if I offer you enough Essence Crystals, you'll cool your temper and let this 'Lachlan' the pathetic human off the hook."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I were still that weakling Lachlan, I probably would have caved by now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the unfortunate truth for you is that I'm not Lachlan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the insults rained down on him and Jeffrey's threats loomed large, Osborne remained unnervingly calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said coldly, "Pathetic human? I don't see us as pathetic at all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I remember correctly, Lord Malevolence himself is also from the Human Community, isn't he? You so-called noble races eventually bowed down to him, didn't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If humans are so lowly, why do you submit to him? Are you too afraid to stand on your own two feet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And if humans are so beneath you, why bother taking on human forms? Do you hate your true selves that much?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You transform to please Lord Malevolence, all while mocking the Human Community. Don't you find that utterly ridiculous?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression was one of mockery, and his words struck a nerve, causing the crowd to shift uncomfortably with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bold move, Lachlan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're asking for trouble! How dare you compare the great Lord Malevolence to your lowly humankind? He is a Paramount Supreme Clan, far above your pathetic existence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To even utter such blasphemy is unforgivable! Even if I were willing to overlook this, the others wouldn't!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're dead meat! Do you want to end it yourself, or should I do the honors?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey's eyes burned with murderous intent, and the other squad leaders, along with the regular members, glared at Osborne, their anger boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne merely smiled, unfazed by the threats, "You think you can kill me? I'll give you a chance! If you think humans are so beneath you, let's settle this with a fight! I'm a Transcendent Deity, just like you, and you're at the peak of that level. Let's see if you can easily wipe the floor with this 'pathetic human'!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne's words hung in the air, Jeffrey's eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't wrap his head around it. "What's gotten into Lachlan today? How dare he speak to me like that and challenge me to a fight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is he looking for death?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Doesn't he realize that even if he somehow wins, his fate will be nothing short of tragic?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no way he can defeat me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cold fury flickered in Jeffrey's gaze. "Fine, Lachlan! I used to think you were obedient and sensible, which is why I didn't mind your lowly Human Community status and even considered giving you a chance. But if you're going to act like a madman, then I can't let you live!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're looking for death, I'll be happy to oblige!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once we wipe out all these Deathborn, I'll give you the chance to challenge me! I'll show you just how pathetic your Human Community really is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Jeffrey let out a disdainful snort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There aren't many Deathborns left, so let's finish them off quickly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once they're gone, it'll be your turn, Lachlan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't even think about running away, because I'll be right on your heels. You won't escape! You'd better write your last words now, or you might find yourself out of time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne simply smiled at Jeffrey's threats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I won't run. If you think you can kill me, then bring it on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Osborne's unwavering calm, Jeffrey furrowed his brow in annoyance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he quickly brushed it off. He was confident in his ability to crush Lachlan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold snort, Jeffrey sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He rallied his team and charged at the last hundred Deathborn, swiftly cutting them down in a final sweep.</span></p></div>
