        <h1>Chapter 1418 Wild Flame City's Situation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't believe it! After living for decades in this mine, we're only a few thousand miles from Wild Flame City, one of the three major cities in the East Zone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It feels like we've been living in two entirely different worlds!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia exchanged awestruck glances, their voices filled with wonder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they caught their first glimpse of Wild Flame City in the distance, their eyes widened in disbelief. The sprawling city stretched endlessly before them, a breathtaking panorama of grand buildings, perfectly paved roads, and bustling crowds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what truly took their breath away were the five massive floating mountains hovering above the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each mountain, spanning dozens of miles, was positioned in the east, west, south, north, and center of Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They floated thousands of feet above, shrouded in clouds that obscured their details, creating an almost mystical atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne couldn't hide his astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From Lachlan's memories, he understood that these floating mountains were sustained by immense divine power. To keep them aloft, a constant supply of Essence Crystals was required, feeding the intricate formation that maintained their elevation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the divine power ever ran low, the mountains would plummet to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, such a catastrophe had never occurred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For over a century, the five mountains had remained suspended high above without a single incident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These mountains represented five distinct factions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The central mountain belonged to the Ninth Dark Deity Legion's Wild Flame Army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only warriors of the rank of chiliarch or higher could reside and live atop that great mountain, enjoying a commanding view of the entire city below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other four mountains were claimed by the ruling lord of Wild Flame City and the three most powerful Dark Deity clans: the Demonic Dragon Clan, the Soaring Lion Clan, and the Mystic Feather Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence commanded a diverse array of warriors from numerous clans, but there were clear hierarchies among them. Some clans wielded great power, while others were relatively weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Demonic Dragon Clan, Soaring Lion Clan, and Mystic Feather Clan stood at the pinnacle of Wild Flame City's social structure, their status far exceeding that of other clans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their members were formidable, holding high-ranking positions within both the Wild Flame Army and the City Guard, thereby securing the lion's share of resources and wealth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast, clans like the Aether Hawks, Fero Tigers, and Rainbow Vipers occupied a much lower tier in the hierarchy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, no matter how lowly their status, they still ranked above the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within Wild Flame City, the Human Community was undeniably the most marginalized group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hardly any warriors from the Human Community attained high-ranking positions within the Wild Flame Army or the City Guard. For someone like Lachlan to serve as a squad leader was already quite an achievement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne recalled from Lachlan's memories that the highest-ranking member of the Human Community in Wild Flame City was a chiliarch named Calvin Swift, who also hailed from the Swift family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, there were around five hundred chiliarches in the Wild Flame Army, and even fifty who held the rank of leader of ten thousand, let alone the ten generals, three vice-commanders, and one commander above them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In summary, the Human Community held a dismal status in Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, when referring to the Human Community, it specifically meant the native humans of Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was another Human Community in Celestara, albeit smaller in number but of much higher status, as each of its members had been brought by Lord Malevolence himself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence was, in fact, a part of the Human Community, yet these humans saw no kinship with the native inhabitants of Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't even consider themselves to be part of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, they proudly referred to themselves as the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite sharing identical appearances with the Human Community, the Paramount Supreme Clan enjoyed a status that was entirely the opposite. Wherever they went, they were treated with utmost reverence, commanding respect even from the most powerful races.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In stark contrast, the Human Community was a marginalized group, often subjected to insult and humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This striking similarity in appearance led to a peculiar norm among the other factions. In typical situations, many of the other hundred races would disguise themselves as members of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So now, as Osborne surveyed the throngs of people in Wild Flame City, he almost felt as though he'd returned to the Blue Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The buildings here weren't quite as tall as those back on Blue Planet, but they were larger and sturdier, constructed from solid rock. Even warriors of the Superior Deity or even Transcendent Deity rank would struggle to bring them down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's move back to my place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gestured for his companions to follow him to Lachlan's residence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lachlan lived on the outskirts of Wild Flame City, not due to his lowly status, but because of a pressing threat from the Deathborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To counter this danger, the 500 thousand warriors of the Wild Flame Army were positioned around the city, with only those of chiliarch rank and above allowed to dwell in the central floating mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone else had to make their home on the city's fringes, creating a protective barrier to prevent any Deathborn from breaching the city's walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they approached, Lachlan's residence came into view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a structure carved from a massive stone.</span></p></div>
