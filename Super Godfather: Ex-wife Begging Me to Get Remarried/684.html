        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is she Osborne's girlfriend? It's a shame that he has a girlfriend already, and she's so gifted."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma frowned, her eyes with a battle intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't notice her abnormality and continued, "Clarissa will help Osborne. If we want to beat Osborne, there may be no chance. Then, it's time for us to think about how to keep the second place!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma smiled faintly, "Can't we beat him yet? We should try! Even if Clarissa is truly as gifted as Vivienne, I won't lose to her so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not losing to anyone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other side, in Jalmar, Matthew stared intently at Osborne's points on the scoreboard and smiled helplessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it. I knew he was my greatest competitor, but I didn't realize he was so sick! He got eight thousand points in one battle, killed three members from the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> who reached Class AAA, and his girlfriend helped him do it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What should we do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew smiled helplessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His grandfather was Bob, the second elder of the main bloodline of the Augustine family, and at this moment, he was equally helpless. He had contacted Caleb long ago and got the same news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's girlfriend Clarissa attacked alone and killed the warrior from the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> who had reached Class AAA in a matter of minutes, taking back the headquarters in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, in this world, why is it so unfair? It's so devastating to be so gifted like Emma and Osborne! I've tried hard enough, but instead of defeating them, I was rapidly surpassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne is the most odious. He's incredibly talented, and he has found an awesome girlfriend! She killed three members who reached Class AAA in a matter of minutes all by herself, and I couldn't even kill a member who reached Class AAA. I bet she could beat me into a pile of mush!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bob rolled his eyes when he heard that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Geniuses are only a minority after all. You don't have to be too inferior! In my opinion, the Augustine family doesn't necessarily need the most powerful and the most talented, and what is needed is the ability! It's the ability to control the whole situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For that, I believe you are the best.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right now, what you have to think about is not surpassing Osborne's ranking, but rather, you have to keep the third place! As long as you can keep the third place, you can become the third heir of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the future, you'll still have a chance to become the leader of the Augustine family, even though it's hard. You are the descendant of the Augustine </span><span>family,</span><span> your goal </span><span>would be to strengthen the Augustine family instead of having to compete for the leader."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew nodded after hearing that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, don't worry. I know what I should do! If Osborne and Emma are truly better than me and better lead the Augustine family to a glorious future, I will congratulate and assist them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I won't give up so easily!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if I can't defeat them, I'll still try!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Matthew's eyes were filled with fighting intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the headquarters in </span><span>Skyefall</span><span>, Owen and Lance had been staring at the scoreboard for more than ten minutes, neither of them speaking, looking embarrassed, with anger and resentment suppressed deep in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Owen, give up competing with Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if we teamed up, there's no way we could surpass him in the scoreboard! Our goal now should be on Matthew and Emma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we beat either of them, you'll be in the top three!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen's eyes were filled with reluctance when he heard that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he knew Lance had a point, so all he could do was grunt, "Osborne was lucky! His girlfriend, Clarissa, actually improved and became so strong so quickly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph, if I had such a girlfriend, I would also be ranked number one, and I would definitely not lose to Osborne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, he waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's have a meeting! Next, we have to be a bit more aggressive, and we have to get into the top three!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was soon ten o'clock in the evening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, at the headquarters in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, all the members from the Blood Demon Organization had finished resting. Their power had become stronger. After the baptism of blood, they also became more like a true warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stopped his cultivation and had everyone gather once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He projected a map, pointed at the three red dots on the map, and said calmly, "These are the three rare metal mines in </span><span>Dampston</span><span> that are our targets tonight. The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> started this war, and I felt that there was something weird about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their real goal is not to occupy more areas of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> but to occupy these rare metal mines. I suspect that the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> have assigned more warriors to guard these rare metal mines!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our actions tonight will be based on sneak attacks!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will be the first to set out to spy on these rare metal mines. All of you will wait for my order and prepare for the attack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As you command!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded and waved his hand to rip open the dimensional rift. He took Clarissa's hand and stepped in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, his body disappeared and appeared thirty miles away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After several interdimensional travels, the two arrived at the first rare metal mine area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had been to this mine area once before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, it was guarded by only three Marquis Medusa who had reached Class AA, but he had easily killed them. Now the place was incredibly lively, with countless large machines running. They were mining like crazy even at night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and Clarissa hid in the distance and observed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing such a situation, they were both very surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of rare metals does this rare metal mine produce? The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> seem to pay extra attention to it."</span></p></div>
