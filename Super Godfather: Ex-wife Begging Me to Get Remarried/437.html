        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, Isa froze. She opened her mouth, but in the end, she remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She coldly asked, "Actions speak louder. If I were really in danger someday, would you truly risk your life to save me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you knew it would mean certain death, would you still go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that situation ever arose, even if I knew I was walking into certain death, I would still go to save you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing Osborne's unwavering resolve, Isa's expression finally softened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Remember what you've said."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't forget."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, full of anticipation, asked, "Isa, can you tell me the method now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa hesitated for a moment but finally nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have a method that might allow you to become a Class A Power Master right now. And once you succeed, you'll be able to control your power immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up. "What do I need to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa said seriously, "Is your soul of powers stuck, unable to progress any further, no matter what you do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's because your growth has been too rapid. Your soul of powers hasn't even had time to stabilize before reaching its current limit! In this situation, it's natural that you can't break through the limit. Normally, you would need more time to accumulate strength and wait for your soul of powers to stabilize before it can continue to grow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This waiting period could be months, or even years."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Isa described was exactly the predicament he was facing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, what should I do?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Under normal circumstances, nothing would work for you now. But I know a way that can not only push you to Class A instantly but also transform you, elevating your power in an unprecedented way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And the method is simple. Instead of allowing your soul of powers to grow, you can compress it. You must use a massive amount of energy to compress your soul of powers to its absolute limit and then fuse it with your body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This way, your soul of powers will undergo a transformation, but it will be even more thorough. By doing that, your strength will surpass that of a typical Class A Power Master!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Moreover, once your soul of powers is fully fused with your body, it will bring special benefits, making your physical form stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In this way, you'll be able to use Power more easily and quickly than others."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa finished speaking, and Osborne's eyes sparkled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he quickly calmed down and asked, "Where's the danger in this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa coldly stared at him and said, "At least you haven't completely lost your mind and still remember there's danger involved."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rubbed his nose. "I'm not stupid. While I'm willing to take risks, that doesn't mean I don't value my life. I still want to live. After all, only by staying alive can I protect those I care about."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's expression softened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are many dangers. Compressing your soul of powers to its limit will be incredibly difficult. The power needed to compress it is unimaginable, and compressing it to the extreme is even more challenging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This step requires not only a massive amount of power but also incredibly precise control. It's like using a large excavator to peel a raw egg while keeping the membrane inside intact and not letting the egg white spill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One small mistake, and you're dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, you don't need to worry too much because I will personally handle this process. After all, I'm the only one who can achieve this. I will compress your soul of powers to its most extreme state. The more extreme the compression, the more complete your transformation will be and the greater your future potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In short, you can just leave this step to me. I won't let you down. The real danger might occur when the compressed soul of powers fuses with your body. That's when things could go wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I can't predict what might happen at that stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, since I came up with this method, no one has ever tried it. You'll be the first! Although there's a theoretical chance of success, there's also..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa looked at Osborne again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not too late to change your mind. With your talent and with my guidance, you could become one of the world's top powerhouses within just a few years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the future, you will have a good chance of becoming a Class S Supreme Overlord! Are you really sure you want to take such a huge risk just to increase your power in a short time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and smiled, "Isa, you don't need to convince me. I won't give up! In fact, deep down, you're also hoping I'll take this risk, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued, "Isa, if you truly didn't want me to take this risk, you could go and help me to rescue Clarissa, and I wouldn't have to rush to increase my strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you didn't suggest that! So the only possibility is that, deep down, you want me to take this risk. You want me to take this brand new path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa bit her lip and glared at Osborne. "Do you have to be so smart?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's start!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you die, I'll just find another man!"</span></p></div>
