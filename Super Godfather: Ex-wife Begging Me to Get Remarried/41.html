        <h1>Chapter 41 Lapdog</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Wesley didn&rsquo;t dare say anything and immediately thought to sit on Clarissa&rsquo;s other side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Unfortunately, Ophelia was quicker than him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley felt dejected but didn&rsquo;t dare to make a scene, so he walked to the other side and sat down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this moment, Ophelia said, &ldquo;Ms. Radcliffe, thank you for your hospitality. It&rsquo;s my first time here, and I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to bring, so I prepared a small gift. I hope you will accept it.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She then presented a small box to Clarissa with a look of anxiety and reverence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguard immediately moved to inspect it, but Clarissa stopped them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The three had been checked before entering the estate, so there was no danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa smiled and said, &ldquo;You must be Ms. Caldwell, you are too kind. I invited you all for lunch, so how can I accept your gift?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia was pleasantly surprised. &ldquo;Ms. Radcliffe, you know me? I&rsquo;m truly honored. This is just a small gift; I was worried you wouldn&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After a moment of hesitation, feeling Ophelia&rsquo;s enthusiasm, Clarissa nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Alright then.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She accepted the gift and, to Ophelia&rsquo;s expectant gaze, opened the box. A dazzling glow of emerald jewels burst out, filling the entire pavilion with a shimmering green light.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa frowned, saying, &ldquo;Imperial Green diamond earrings? Ms. Caldwell, this is too precious. I cannot accept this.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Ophelia smiled and said, &ldquo;Ms. Radcliffe, don&rsquo;t worry. My family is in the jewelry design business, and I personally designed these Imperial Green diamond earrings. They may be precious to others, but in your presence, they seem dull. I hope that in the future, we can have the opportunity to work together.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa hesitated for a moment before nodding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With her status, she did not lack in top-tier jewelry. Just two days ago, she had spent 100 million dollars buying the Ocean Whisper Sapphire, so while these earrings were not cheap, they were only worth a few million.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">There was no need for Clarissa to fuss over them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;If we have the opportunity to collaborate, I will have my family consider the Caldwell family.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia was thrilled at this prospect.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this moment, Wesley also stood up quickly and presented an exquisite box.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He showed no trace of the pride of a wealthy heir and said, &ldquo;Ms. Radcliffe, I also prepared a small gift for you. I hope you like it.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This time, Clarissa didn&rsquo;t beat around the bush and opened the box to reveal a set of handmade paintbrushes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;These are Cadence Cooper&rsquo;s handmade paintbrushes; they&rsquo;re not easy to come by. I really like them. Thank you, Mr. Ashford.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley was also delighted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He knew Clarissa enjoyed painting, so he had gone to great lengths to acquire this set of Cadence&rsquo;s handmade paintbrushes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As Clarissa expressed her liking, his goal was achieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ms. Radcliffe, my family deals with gemstone materials. I hope in the future, we can collaborate with the Radcliffe family.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa smiled and nodded, not saying much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She remained calm and gentle, her voice soft but distant, not becoming any closer to the two because of their gifts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The two knew that if they wanted to establish a relationship with Clarissa and truly collaborate with the Radcliffe family, it wouldn&rsquo;t be as simple as gifting her something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this moment, Wesley suddenly looked at Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He smiled faintly and said, &ldquo;Osborne, what about the gift you prepared for Ms. Radcliffe? Bring it out and let us all see it.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At his words, Osborne glanced at Wesley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In Wesley&rsquo;s eyes, there was a hint of disdain and mockery. Clearly, he thought that Osborne couldn&rsquo;t come up with anything valuable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He brought it up on purpose to see Osborne&rsquo;s embarrassment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, this time, Wesley got it all wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne wasn&rsquo;t unable to present a valuable gift; he simply hadn&rsquo;t prepared one at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">While Wesley and Ophelia were there to suck up to Clarissa, Osborne had been invited as a guest and hadn&rsquo;t even thought about bringing a gift.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What? Osborne, are you seriously telling me you didn&rsquo;t bother to prepare a gift for Ms. Radcliffe? You&rsquo;re really not showing her any respect, huh?&rdquo; Wesley taunted, his smirk betraying his disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The mockery in his eyes intensified as he silently berated Osborne for not even understanding basic etiquette.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne gave Wesley a cold stare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Initially, Ophelia and Wesley&rsquo;s attempts to cozy up to Clarissa had left Osborne unfazed; he found their groveling amusing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Wesley&rsquo;s deliberate provocation pushed him too far.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In response to Wesley&rsquo;s jab, Osborne coolly stated, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, I didn&rsquo;t specifically prepare a gift. After all, I was invited as a guest, unlike you, Wesley, who seems to be here to play the lapdog role.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At his words, Wesley&rsquo;s smug expression froze, twisting into a hostile one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Osborne, who do you think you&rsquo;re calling a lapdog?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting out of line here. In front of Ms. Radcliffe, using such vulgar language? You&rsquo;re embarrassing her.&rdquo;</p></div>
