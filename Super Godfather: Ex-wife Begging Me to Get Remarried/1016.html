        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two hours later, Osborne finally stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa wasn&rsquo;t joking; when she said he couldn't stop for even a second, she meant it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Osborne, this level of exertion was a walk in the park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he looked down at Isa, panting beneath him, a wave of satisfaction washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My man is getting better and better," Isa said, her voice playful as she wrapped her arms around his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cheeks were flushed with the afterglow of the passion, and she planted a soft kiss on his lips before starting to get dressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, are you really leaving again?" Osborne asked, hesitation creeping into his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted her to stay to help him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that he was the new Godfather, the Augustine family and the Draco Group both relied on him for protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With threats looming from the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, and the League of Divine Descent, the pressure was mounting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa slipped on her clothes, glancing at him with calm determination. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I have to go. I know what you want to say, but I can't stay to help you. First, I need to find the God of Time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Second, this is a test for you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're my man, Osborne. If you can't handle the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, or the League of Divine Descent, maybe you should just give it all up and settle for being a little man by my side. I can protect you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rubbed his nose, not keen on the idea of being a "little man" under Isa's protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa continued, "Right now, your opponents are just the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, and the League of Divine Descent. Sure, they're top-tier forces on Blue </span><span>Planet, but in </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, they nothing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And don't forget about Lord Malevolence and Dark Deity. I wasn't joking; they're real, and they'll be our enemies soon enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> I need you to step up. Take down the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, deal with the League of Divine Descent and the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, and grow stronger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When you do, I'll share more truths about this world with you. I might even take you to </span><span>Celestara</span><span> to see what it's really like!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Isa finished dressing and stepped back to face him, pressing her cheek against his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I need your help!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have all the patience in the world for you to grow, but this world doesn&rsquo;t!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have to level up quickly. Or you might never see me again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words hung heavy in the air, sending a chill down Osborne's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He furrowed his brow, urgency in his voice as he asked, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, why might I never see you again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa shook her head, evading the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She offered a small smile and changed the subject. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, here's a free piece of intel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been tracking the energy fluctuations of the God of Time, and they've been concentrated near the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' stronghold. I've noticed they're mobilizing troops on a massive scale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hundreds, even thousands of Class S divine clones have already entered </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>! The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> is gearing up for a full-scale war, and it's about to kick off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's words left Osborne in shock, his mind racing as the implications sank in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "Divine clones?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They must be referring to the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa actually saw thousands of Class S clones entering </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How is that even possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So many divine clones?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it hadn't been for Isa, I would've assumed there are only a couple hundred Class S clones at most. Even that is a terrifying prospect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But a thousand?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo has managed to produce a thousand Class S clones?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How on earth am I supposed to fight against that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A heavy weight settled in Osborne's chest as he felt the gravity of the situation. Just when he was about to ask Isa for more details, she flashed him a small smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't ask me anything. Don't try to ask for my help. You have to handle this all on your own!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just hurry up and get stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's the only way you can help me. Otherwise, if you can't find me again, don't cry like a little baby!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could respond, Isa's figure abruptly vanished from sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne blinked, bewildered, unable to fathom how she had left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were no spatial fluctuations, no hint of power in the air&mdash;she had just </span><span>disappeared in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoa!" Osborne inhaled sharply, a chill running down his spine as he felt the depth of Isa's power&mdash;a strength that seemed boundless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne muttered under his breath, "Rely on myself, huh?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want me to grow quickly and come to your aid? Or I might not be able to see you again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't let that happen! I can't!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes burned with resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, and the League of Divine Descent. I'll take care of them all by myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But confronting the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> was a difficult task. Nearly a thousand Class S clones, along with the formidable Gerardo, loomed ahead of him like a dark cloud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pressure was mounting; given their current strength, Osborne felt utterly outmatched.</span></p></div>
