        <h1>Chapter 680 One Against Three</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Duke Medusa and the other two were staring at Osborne and the others and said indifferently, "Two of them have reached Class AAA and two of them have reached Class AA. If we join forces, we'll just deal with them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, the three suddenly rushed towards Osborne and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised his eyebrows and was about to do something when Clarissa stopped in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, let me try this time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was going to give it a try. She hadn't truly fought since she broke Class AA, and she was curious to see where her limits were now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment and finally nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reminded, "Be careful. Duke Medusa's unique skill is the Ashes of Death, which has an incredibly terrifying petrification effect, much stronger than Ghost Petrification. She could burn the enemy's body to ashes from the inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But once Duke Medusa performs it, she will fall into weakness. She doesn't dare to perform it unless she's in a desperate situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Duke Titan is powerful, and his defense is terrifying. His unique skill is the Formidable Punch. He can lose one of his arms in exchange for his terrifying power, so you can never get hit by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Duke Werewolf's attack has strong penetration, but you can defend against it with your Divine and Demonic Wings. His unique skill is the Death Claw, so even if you have Divine and Demonic Wings, you can't force an attack on him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly explained to Clarissa the power of Duke Medusa, Duke Titan, and Duke Werewolf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stunned Caleb and Janet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb said with concern, "Osborne, are you going to leave her alone against a siege of three warriors who have reached Class AAA? Don't we need to attack them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "No, let's wait and see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Duke Medusa, Duke Titan, and Duke Werewolf had rushed over by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa gripped the Fate Staff tightly and attacked them without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Duke Medusa watched Clarissa with indifference, her eyes filled with suspicion and caution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You only reached Class AA. Why don't you hide behind them instead of daring to face us on your own? You are beautiful, so don't you want to live anymore?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Duke Titan said loudly, "Why are you talking crap with her? Since she wants to die, just kill her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Duke Titan directly punched Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa looked indifferent as a pair of huge wings suddenly appeared behind her, which were pure white on one side and dark and evil black on the other. The wings were spread out to 164 feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was none other than Divine and Demonic Wings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing Duke Titan's strength attack, Clarissa's Divine and Demonic Wings swung violently and slapped hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a crack, Divine and Demonic Wings clashed with Duke Titan's punch, and there was a violent noise. Clarissa took two steps back, while Duke Titan flipped backward and flew out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Duke Titan was unexpectedly at a disadvantage in this confrontation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, even Osborne was incredibly surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Her Divine and Demonic Wings are quite impressive! Even if it's me, it's hard for me to overpower Duke Titan in terms of power without transforming into Blood Clan or using the Breath of Celestial to increase my power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Clarissa did it with her Divine and Demonic Wings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb and Janet were also stunned. Duke Titan's power even made them feel terrified. If they forced an attack, they would most likely suffer a loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, Clarissa suppressed Duke Titan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked at each other with excitement in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janet whispered to Caleb, "Caleb, do you remember Vivienne? That witch reached Class AAA at the age of twenty, and she married Godfather's son, Osborne's mother!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb nodded and said seriously, "How could I not remember? Osborne's mother was </span><span>Vivienne, and she seemed very talented at first. No one of her generation from the Augustine family was a match for her, and even Osborne's father was nowhere near her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janet nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Janet looked at Clarissa and sighed, "I see Vivienne in this girl. I even think she is probably more gifted than Vivienne was back then!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb was shocked. "Is that possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why isn't it possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janet took a deep breath. "Osborne was already amazing to us, but I didn't think his girlfriend was even more amazing. If they both improved quickly instead of disappearing like Osborne's parents...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather might actually have an heir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she continued to watch the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Duke Medusa and Duke Werewolf also began to attack, no longer daring to treat Clarissa as a normal person who had reached Class AA, so they chose to just join forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's attack together and kill her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Duke Medusa executed the Ghost Petrification on Clarissa, and Duke Werewolf flew in to attack with his sharp claws.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Combined with Duke Titan who attacked again, Clarissa instantly suffered a terrifying siege.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, even Osborne felt nervous, he wasn't sure if Clarissa would handle it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, three warriors who had reached Class AAA were surrounding her.</span></p></div>
