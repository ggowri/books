        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne opened his eyes, and </span><span>two brilliant beams of light shot forth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The purple glow of Satan's Eye </span><span>was </span><span>from his left </span><span>eye, </span><span>and the golden brilliance of Medusa's Gaze</span><span>, his right one</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>massive surge of fate power coursed through him, completely absorbed by his body after three months of relentless cleansing and transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During that deep slumber, he had changed profoundly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both his Satan's Eye and Medusa's Gaze had significantly heightened, although Osborne had yet to </span><span>know</span><span> </span><span>exactly how much</span><span> this newfound power</span><span> existed</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he could </span><span>know</span><span>, however, was that his entire skeletal structure felt fundamentally transformed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the fate power flowed through his veins, the Breath of Celestial had automatically triggered, guiding the fate power to overhaul his physical form while silently integrating the star power within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Osborne could feel </span><span>that his </span><span>body was stronger than it had ever been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He whispered to himself, breathless with excitement,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If this isn't the peak of Class S, then I don't know what is! All that's left is to forge Divine Bone and Divine Flesh, and I'll ascend to the realm of the gods!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he marveled at his progress, his gaze flickered to the Draco Star Wristlet, and he </span><span>was shocked</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three months?! I've slept for a whole three months?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "It felt like just a </span><span>blink of eye</span><span>, and yet, three months have zipped by! Surely nothing catastrophic happened in that time, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without pausing to further assess the changes in his body, Osborne burst out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne! You're awake!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A voice </span><span>came</span><span> in </span><span>surprise</span><span>. He froze, </span><span>turned over to find the voice. Then he trembled with excitement</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zoe!" Osborne exclaimed, his heart racing as he rushed over to her, gripping her shoulders tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zoe?! No way, is this real? I thought you and Anastasia were gone... killed by Gerardo! How are you still here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His excitement was palpable, almost overwhelming, and he couldn't shake the feeling he might just be dreaming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ow, Osborne! You're hurting me!" Zoe frowned, her </span><span>face</span><span> in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing his grip, he quickly released her, guilt etching across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, his eyes bore into hers, refusing to blink, as if that might shatter the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you</span><span> </span><span>okay?" he asked</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe assured him, her bright smile lighting up the room, "I'm fine, really! Anastasia is okay, too! We were supposed to die, but Divine Shadow saved us! He took us to a magical place where we could hide."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne fel</span><span>t overjoyed</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "</span><span> </span><span>Zoe</span><span> </span><span>and </span><span>Anastasia </span><span>are </span><span>alive</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They weren't slain by Gerardo; they were rescued instead! He lied to provoke me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears of joy brimmed in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weight of anguish he had carried, believing he would never see them again, began to lift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's emotions surged, and he found himself crying, indescribably happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, from the corner of his eye, a flash of color caught his attention as a familiar figure rushed toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Anastasia!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia </span><span>stopped in front of him for some distance with</span><span> her gaze fixed on him. Tears streamed down her face as she was unable to contain her emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne froze, his mind a whirlwind of emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eight years had passed since Anastasia's thirteenth birthday when she first fell ill. Eight long years since he had last seen her standing before him, healthy and whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each time, Anastasia was confined to her sickbed, rarely conscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, finally, Osborne beheld Anastasia standing before him, unscathed and grown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>T</span><span>h</span><span>ree months </span><span>after her waking up</span><span>, </span><span>her once-emaciated frame had filled out, making her appear</span><span> </span><span>elegant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They locked eyes, tears streaming down their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, Anastasia rushed towards him, colliding fiercely into his embrace, clutching his waist with all her might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!" she cried out between sobs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shuddered, immediately </span><span>holding</span><span> Anastasia just as tightly, as if releasing her for even a moment would mean losing her all over again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia!" he echoed, tears flowing freely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only they knew the depth of their affection for one another. For eight years, Osborne had stood vigil by Anastasia's sickbed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During these last three months, while Osborne lay unconscious, Anastasia had kept watch over him, experiencing </span><span>the agony, uncertainty, and despair</span><span> that he had for her</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, Osborne </span><span>woke up</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne! I missed you so much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia finally managed to stop crying after what felt like an eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes red and swollen, she clung tightly to Osborne's arm, resting her head against it, reluctant to let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe looked on, utterly envious of their bond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, word of Osborne's awakening reached the </span><span>top level</span><span> of the Augustine family, and they </span><span>hurriedly assembled, their faces grim</span><span>.</span></p></div>
