        <h1>Chapter 888 Fateful Battle</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's that supposed to mean?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne frowned, confusion evident in his gaze as he stared at Felicity.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knew Sebastian had suffered his first defeat after an impressive run of ninety-five victories, but he had no clue who had brought Sebastian down.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he scanned the audience, he noticed many seasoned members of the Augustine family glaring at Felicity, their faces twisted with anger.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Something felt off.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Felicity smiled, "Looks like you're in the dark about this. Let me enlighten you! Over forty years ago, at Sebastian's Honor Quest Ceremony, the one who defeated him, shattering his dream of a hundred wins, was none other than my father&mdash;Cassian!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If it weren't for my dad, he might've achieved that hundred-win milestone. But alas, my father put a stop to that, leaving Sebastian's record stuck at ninety-five. If my father hadn't intervened, who knows what heights Sebastian could have reached?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Felicity's pride shone through as she continued, "So, in a way, it's my father who dashed Sebastian's dreams of becoming a global top-tier fighter!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And now, fate has brought me here to challenge you while you pursue your own hundred victories in your ninety-sixth match.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is truly a destined showdown!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll defeat you just like my father did to Sebastian, crushing your hopes of that hundred-win streak!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that declaration, a powerful energy surged from Felicity, crashing over the arena like a tidal wave.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The spectators below could feel her strength and stared at her in shock.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What a formidable presence!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Her true power is definitely more than just being ranked 128! She's been flying under the radar; otherwise, she'd be in the top hundred or even pushing for the top fifty!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne stared at Felicity, astonished.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "So, Cassian is her father, the one who defeated Godfather all those years ago?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wants to replicate that achievement and stop me? What a fool's errand!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He let out a cold laugh, his tone steady. "Destined showdown? You must be overestimating yourself! You think you can stand as my rival and have a fateful match with me?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Felicity scoffed, saying, "Osborne, you're even more arrogant than Sebastian!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smirked. "You're nowhere near your father's level!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Compared to your grandfather, you fall even shorter!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You think you can thwart my hundred-win quest? Ridiculous! Let's get this fight started!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, a fierce energy erupted from Osborne as well. Knowing Felicity's true identity, he wasn't going to let her walk away unscathed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had likely come at Gerardo's behest to disrupt his Honor Quest Ceremony.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Given the longstanding animosity he shared with the Aberrants, Osborne resolved that Felicity wouldn't leave alive.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While he couldn't kill her in the arena, seriously injuring her was well within his reach.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Felicity's expression turned icy.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Arrogant! My father ended Sebastian's winning streak, and I will end yours! Prepare to lose!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Felicity unleashed her Realm&mdash;Spatial Domain!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne blinked in surprise; this was the first time he faced an opponent with Spatial Domain. Those who wielded such spatial power were exceedingly rare, and even fewer could truly control Spatial Domain.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he quickly regained his composure.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He remembered that Gerardo's main power was spatial power. Despite being defeated by Sebastian, Gerardo had managed to survive.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It made sense that Felicity, as his granddaughter, would inherit similar abilities.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne braced himself, feeling the intensity of Felicity's Spatial Domain swirl around him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Level Two Realm!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Felicity sneered, saying, "Osborne, prepare to feel the might of the Spatial Domain.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Spatial Prison!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Spatial Collapse!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, Felicity made her move.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The terrifying power exploded, and it was a spatial attack that Osborne knew all too well. Knowing its potential for devastation only made him more aware of its fearsome strength.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, he did not panic.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although the power of Spatial Collapse was fearsome, as long as Osborne avoided the collapsing core, his current strength would keep him safe.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And what about capturing his movements with Spatial Prison?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smirked, then easily sliced through the Spatial Prison and calmly walked out of the core area of the Spatial Collapse.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rumbling noises broke out.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even in the periphery, the collapse's power was still fearsome, but Osborne's martial art aura flickered, blocking the attack.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He smirked at Felicity, unimpressed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not bad, but do you really think this is enough to take me down? You're not the only one with a Spatial Domain!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Saying so, Osborne unleashed his Realm's power for the first time.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Spatial Domain!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His Spatial Domain erupted, reaching near Level Three with its power, far outstripping Felicity's Level Two Spatial Domain.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A collision of the two Realms ensued.</p></div>
