        <h1>Chapter 621 Training Base No. 6</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback when Owen showed up to provoke him again, his expression instantly turning cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said coldly, "Don't get too pleased with yourself. You've only got the support of eight elders, far behind Matthew and Vincent. What do you have to be so proud of?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know if I'll win, but I'm sure you won't!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen's face also darkened at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With disdain, he said, "At least I have the support of eight elders, four times more than yours! What's more, my mother is from the Caldwell family in Newport City, and they will back me to the hilt. And what do you have? The branch bloodlines in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pathetic. Apart from you, there seems to be only one Class A master in the entire </span><span>Dampston</span><span> branch bloodlines, and he's a cripple. Can they help you at all?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you even hold two provinces with the forces behind you? It's laughable! I'm afraid your defenses will crumble as soon as the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> attacks, and you'll be begging for my help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen finished with a look of utter contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He genuinely believed Osborne had no chance, as the forces supporting him were far too weak. Even Lance, who was a branch of </span><span>Yalynch</span><span>, had much more robust support than Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen, on the other hand, had the support of not only eight Class AA elders from the main bloodline of the Augustine family but also many Class A seniors who would become his allies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, the entire Caldwell family of Newport City would support him wholeheartedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the Caldwell family's strength was not as great as the Augustine family, it was by no means weak. They had more than ten Class AA strongmen alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why Owen was so confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His personal strength might not be as good as Vincent, Matthew, or even Emma, but the forces behind him were definitely in the top three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as he played his cards right, he had a chance to be in the top three, even challenging for the top two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What about Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Owen's view, he was destined to come in last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said calmly, "How can you be sure there are no other forces behind me? Stop wasting words. Let's see each other on the battlefield! I hope you won't ask for my help!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, let's meet on the battlefield!" Owen said with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb and Janet watched Osborne and Owen argue with a smile, showing no intention of intervening because this was a contest between the Augustine family's potential heirs. As elders, they could only help fight the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> but not get involved in their disputes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Osborne left the Challenge Peak with Caleb and Janet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, are we leaving for </span><span>Dampston</span><span> right away?" Caleb asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head. "Mr. Caleb Augustine, there's no rush. I have some other matters to attend to. Tomorrow, we'll head back to </span><span>Dampston</span><span> first thing tomorrow morning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb nodded. "Alright, we'll come to you tomorrow morning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thanked them again, then returned to the Third Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him, Isaac, Nathan, and others immediately cheered excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After letting them cheer for a while, Osborne solemnly told them about the impending war of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, </span><span>Dampston</span><span> becoming the battlefield, and the rules of the heir </span><span>selection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished, everyone fell silent, their faces extremely serious and heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I'm sorry, our strength is too weak. I'm afraid we can't help you! Otherwise, with your strength, you definitely have a chance to be in the top three!" Nathan said with a look of guilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled lightly, "Don't blame yourself. It's not your fault. In the upcoming war opened by the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, all you have to do is to survive! I actually have an ace up my sleeve..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A glint appeared deep in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen thought the forces behind him were too weak and that he had no chance, but only he knew that the power behind him was not weak at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Training Base No. 6!" Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After completing the fifth test, Godfather had already awarded him Training Base No. 6, but he had been too busy to receive it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Training Base No. 6, there were twenty Class A instructors and five hundred Class B+ or above students about to graduate, including sixty Class B+, four hundred and thirty Class A-, and ten Class A students.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This force was Osborne's most significant support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the power of Training Base No. 6 was not comparable with the Caldwell family behind Owen, nor with the support forces behind Vincent, Matthew, or even Emma, it was pretty helpful for Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least he was not without anyone to rely on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was preparing to go to Training Base No. 6 and take all twenty instructors and five hundred students to </span><span>Dampston</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> were about to start the war, which would be extremely bloody and brutal, and it was related to the life and death of the Augustine family, so he had to go all out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said goodbye to Isaac and others and left the Augustine Estate alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He came to the mountains north of Newport City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Training Base No. 6 was hidden deep in the mountains, deeper in the </span><span>Lostridge</span><span> Mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was looking forward to Training Base No. 6 at this time, especially to the twenty instructors of the training base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I only know a brief introduction to Training Base No. 6 awarded to me by Godfather. Those twenty instructors are all above Class A, but whether they are Class A, A+, or AA is not clear."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope their strength can be stronger! It would be great if they are all Class AA!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With great anticipation, Osborne finally arrived near Training Base No. 6.</span></p></div>
