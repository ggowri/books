        <h1>Chapter 223 Hunt Down</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was early evening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion's destination&mdash;the Radcliffe Estate&mdash;lay just 124 miles away from Mayby City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At a normal pace, he would reach his destination in no more than two hours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne weighed his options and decided against pursuing Orion from behind. Instead, he veered onto a shortcut, intending to intercept Orion's convoy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pushed his car to the limit, weaving expertly through the traffic. His remarkable eyesight and reflexes allowed him to navigate the winding streets without a hitch, even at breakneck speeds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After an hour of intense driving, Osborne finally managed to position himself ahead of Orion's convoy on the outskirts of Cloudsea City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, night had fallen, and a steady rain began to pour, blanketing the area in darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He parked his car along the edge of a dense thicket, hiding it from view. As the rain pelted down around him, a smirk crept across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "This weather couldn't work better in my favor!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion's convoy should be right around the corner!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he pulled out his Draco Model H mini-handgun&mdash;the very same one he hadn't had time to replace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This little beauty fired bullets quickly but had limited stopping power, not something designed for taking down someone like Orion or his thugs. But that wasn't his intention; he just needed to force Orion's convoy to a halt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, a convoy came into view&mdash;a fleet of luxury cars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This had to be Orion's entourage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They cruised steadily down the highway, edging closer to Osborne's ambush point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't hesitate and sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each bullet tore through the air as Osborne's aim, honed to perfection, sent every round smashing into the tires of the luxury cars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the central vehicle of the convoy, Orion's expression was ferocious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, that bitch! How dare she reject me and date another guy? She belongs to me! Just wait until she joins the Lark family; I'll make her regret this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll have her begging for mercy on the bed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion hissed, his heart still boiling with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The images of Clarissa kissing Osborne flashed in his mind, fueling his murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And that Osborne! How dare he compete for her affections? He's as good as dead! I'll break his limbs and peel his flesh bit by bit! I'll make him beg for a swift end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion's handsome face twisted into a sinister sneer, consumed by his thoughts of revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But suddenly, the car jolted violently, swerving as if a tire had blown. The driver skillfully managed to bring the vehicle to a smooth stop, but confusion surged within the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell just happened?" Orion snapped, his voice cold and demanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of his men exclaimed, panic creeping into his tone, "Mr. Lark, we've got a problem! It looks like all our tires have blown out&mdash;this isn't a coincidence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion's brows knitted together in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All of them? Who in their right mind would dare attack me? I want to see this supposed attacker for myself! Let's get out and assess the situation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still oblivious to the danger, he exuded confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "In Skyefall territory, who would be crazy enough to lay a hand on me, the heir of the Lark family? Not a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the other ancient families wouldn't cross that line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now that I've just transcended to Class B+, I can handle anything life throws at me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second thought, he flung open the car door and stepped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His men followed suit, weapons raised, forming a protective circle around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lark, we've found bullet holes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These tiny holes suggest it's from a handful of handguns. There's someone hiding in those woods, and they've taken out our tires with some serious marksmanship!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion couldn't help but snicker. "Can you believe it? Someone actually dares to attack me? Well, well! This is just perfect! I've been in a foul mood anyway. Let's storm in there and bring that bastard out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll flay him alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fierce resolve only grew. Instead of cowering at the threat, he was ready to charge into the woods, eager to face whoever was behind the attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His men rallied behind him, a throng of thirty loyal followers, all charged up and ready to dive into the jungle, forming a protective wall around Orion as they advanced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep in the underbrush, Osborne couldn't help but smirk</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, shaking his head, "Orion, you really are a cocky one!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But hey, fine by me&mdash;if you want to walk right into the trap, I won't stop you from signing your own death warrant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne deliberately retreated at a leisurely pace, not bothering to conceal his tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He feigned panic as he sauntered deeper into the woods, clearly letting his presence be known.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There! I see him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just one guy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion squinted into the thickening darkness. The shadows made it hard to identify Osborne, but something about the figure seemed familiar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He barked, "Don't let him get away! I want to see who's got the guts to take a shot at me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flick of his wrist, he motioned his men to follow, and they surged forward with wild enthusiasm, eager to catch the attacker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it didn't take long before they halted in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because there stood Osborne, no longer fleeing but casually waiting for them, a wolfish grin plastered on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, well, well... Orion? Looks like we're running into each other again!"</span></p></div>
