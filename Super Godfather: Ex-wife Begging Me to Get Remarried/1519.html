        <h1>Chapter 1518 The Secret of Divine Peak</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes sparkled with renewed enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His primary goal was to eliminate more Deathborns and fully restore the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, but if he could snag some extra Essence Crystals along the way, he certainly wouldn't pass up the opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a few days ago, he had collected 50 thousand top-grade Essence Crystals and 10 million mid-grade ones from the No. 9 mining area, but he had already burned through most of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First, he had spent one million mid-grade Essence Crystals at the slave market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Osborne dropped over 400 thousand Crystals to secure Spark Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before leaving, he allocated another two million mid-grade Crystals to Betty and Darren for emergencies and gave them 10 thousand top-grade Crystals for cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To top it off, Osborne had just shelled out over four million mid-grade Crystals for the Gellar family's Ultimate Malevolence Airship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just two days, Osborne had spent a staggering 10 thousand top-grade Essence Crystals and nearly eight million mid-grade ones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was practically throwing money around like confetti!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Osborne was left with only 40 thousand top-grade Crystals and about two million mid-grade ones. At the rate he was going, those wouldn't last long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So when he heard that the No. 13 mining area was even richer than No. 9, with the top twenty zones producing top-grade Essence Crystals, his mind began to race with possibilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once I take care of the Deathborn in the Gellar family's mine and restore the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, I'll head over to those higher-ranked zones. I'll sweep through their mines and grab every last top-grade and mid-grade Essence Crystal I can find, especially in the Demonic Dragon Clan and Soaring Lion Clan territories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I get the chance, I'll wipe them clean! They won't be able to extract anything but low-grade Essence Crystals after I'm done!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smile crept across Osborne's face as he entertained the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Hannah was watching him closely, her brow furrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of scheme are you cooking up? Let me remind you&mdash;you'd better not get any wild ideas! The No. 13 mining area belongs to the three major Upper Races, and most of their Essence Crystals come from here. Each faction has dispatched powerful defenses to protect it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Some even have Deity Overlord warriors stationed here! Anyone who dares to overstep their bounds will be dealt with swiftly&mdash;no second chances!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's warning brought a serious look to Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he wasn't overly concerned. So what if the Demonic Dragon Clan and Soaring Lion Clan had their Deity Overlord warriors guarding the Essence Crystal mines?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had spatial power and Satan's Eye, which would allow him to slip in and out of their territories undetected, quickly cleaning out their resources.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Osborne were discovered? Good luck catching him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless they had a Deity King warrior on duty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, even if the three major Upper Races have Deity King-level warriors, they would not be stationed at the mining area. There was no need to worry about that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, Osborne replied earnestly, "What are you talking about? Me, cause trouble? I'm here to help you! Besides, how could I possibly cause any chaos? Even if this place produces top-grade Essence Crystals, extracting them is a whole different ballgame. With my strength, how much could I really dig up in a year?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah nodded in agreement. "You've got a point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Extracting Essence Crystals here is no walk in the park! The rock is incredibly hard&mdash;second only to the divine peak! Even those with earth elemental powers would struggle to mine here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's curiosity was piqued at her mention of the divine peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, divine peak? Hannah, I've always been curious about that place. What's it really like? And what happened to those with earth elemental powers?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's expression turned serious, a hint of hesitation crossing her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't say? If it really can't be disclosed, then that's fine&mdash;I'm just purely curious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hesitating for a long time, Hannah eventually shook her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Actually, it's not that I can't say. Everyone in the major factions of Wild Flame City knows, and even some powerful factions within the Human Community are aware.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine peaks are essentially mining zones, and the highest-grade ones at that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Other mining zones might yield top-grade Essence Crystals, but only divine peaks produce Ultimate Essence Crystals and even Celestial Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, all divine peaks are shrouded by a formidable force, making the rock on these peaks incredibly sturdy. Even a Celestial Deity or a Deity Overlord warrior, exerting their full power, cannot mine Essence Crystals from a divine peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only those practitioners with earth elemental power, when they unleash their earth elemental abilities, can slowly carve out mining tunnels and extract Essence Crystals from the heart of a divine peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, almost all earth elemental practitioners, once they reach the Junior Deity level, are sent to various divine peaks to mine Essence Crystals there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their average survival period, however, is only a month!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because divine peaks are incredibly dangerous! Extremely, extremely dangerous!"</span></p></div>
