        <h1>Chapter 547 Time Difference</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The ridicule of the crowd made Nathan, Queenie, and other people from the Dampston branch bloodline feel very uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But they had no way to refute it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They could only clench their fists tightly and swear in their hearts that they must practice harder to make themselves stronger and never be ridiculed again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If they were all Class A and could sign up for the competition, Osborne wouldn't fight alone, and other branch bloodlines wouldn't dare to mock them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I want to kill them!" Nathan gritted his teeth and whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Calm down."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isaac comforted him, "This is a good thing for you. Now you see their arrogant faces. After you have the strength in the future, you can slap them in the face."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nathan and others nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this time, Osborne was the first to jump out of the helicopter and jump into the dense jungle of the Lostridge Mountains.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, the picture didn't disappear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Draco Group's drones followed closely behind Osborne and transmitted the images back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's finally officially started."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, come on!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nathan and others clenched their fists and stared at the screen closely, praying for Osborne in their hearts. They were also curious about what Osborne would do in such a desperate situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne landed easily on the Lostridge Mountains.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at the small drones not far away, he wondered whether to blow it up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he gave up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These drones were used to broadcast the footage of the Branch Bloodline Competition. If they were blown up, he would probably violate the rules and be punished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Osborne's Draco Star Wristlet received a message from Caleb, which was the specific rules of the Branch Bloodline Competition. Osborne took a quick look and saw that there was indeed a rule that prohibited intentional damage to the broadcasting drones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne no longer cared about the drones but was thinking about what to do next.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as he was thinking, a figure suddenly fell from above his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was Lance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lance looked at Osborne with a confident smile. "You haven't run away yet? You only have ten minutes. After ten minutes, they will set out to chase you, snatch your emblem, and eliminate you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lance had a playful look on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne glanced at him and said calmly, "Didn't you also not run away? Compared to me, you seem to be calmer."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lance couldn't help laughing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I didn't run away because I know that no one dares to snatch my emblem. My strength makes me believe that I can keep the emblem.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But you don't seem to have such ability."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne shrugged. "Really? Maybe I will become the future heir in the end, and you will fail."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hahaha."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lance couldn't help but burst into laughter, and his laughter was full of contempt and ridicule.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's impossible!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You should be thankful for the rules. The rules don't allow me, who already has the emblem, to attack you. Otherwise, you would have lost it by now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne also smiled and said, "I want to say this to you as well. If the rules allowed it, you would have lost your emblem."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You are arrogant!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lance sneered, "Then we'll see. If you can become the future heir, I will avoid you when I see you next time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying that, Lance left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He walked very slowly as if he was traveling without any sense of urgency at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne snorted coldly and continued to think of a solution.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He couldn't escape.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The emblem on his chest would send out a signal every fifteen minutes, and everyone could locate him. No matter how far he ran or where he hid, he would be found.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With more than a hundred people chasing him, there was no way he could escape until the end of the competition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thus, he could only fight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In a few minutes, everyone except Lance will target me and try to snatch my emblem.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I have to find a way to reduce their numbers first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne had a plan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The time difference.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The emblem will only send out a signal every fifteen minutes. There are still ten minutes before the next signal is sent. In five minutes, everyone will leave the helicopter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The first thing they will do is to gather together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"After they finish gathering, my emblem will send out a signal. After they locate me, they will chase me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What I need to do is to take advantage of the time difference and launch a sneak attack before they gather and locate me. In this way, I can reduce the people of their group."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne sneered and began to get ready.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this time, at the Arena Number Two on Challenge Peak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone was looking at the screen, which had now been divided into nine smaller screens, allowing everyone to see the different situations of the nine people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But at this time, almost everyone was staring at Osborne's picture.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That brat is so arrogant."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He offended Sam and even dared to talk back to Lance. He is courting death."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If it weren't for the rules, Lance would have killed him in one move."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Arrogance without strength is stupidity."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why doesn't he just run away? Why is he still there?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What does he want to do?"</p></div>
