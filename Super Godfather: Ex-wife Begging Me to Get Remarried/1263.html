        <h1>Chapter 1262 Reaching Intermediate Deity</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ladies and gentlemen, I've made a bold promise to Ms. Rachel Deschanel that within three days, every leader from all superpowers across </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> and the neighboring dozen countries will bow before her. If we can't deliver, I'll face her wrath&mdash;and don't think you'll escape unscathed either!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph glanced coldly at the group before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of him stood over eighty deity-level warriors: thirty-three Superior Deities, fifteen Intermediate Deities, and the rest Junior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This force was nothing short of formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the world's energies had been restored for barely four months, not many, even those surviving from the Age of Gods, could claim the strength of a Superior Deity at this point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With thirty-three Superior Deities at his disposal, it was no wonder Joseph felt confident enough to promise the subjugation of superpowers across those countries in just three days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph continued, "Let's delegate the tasks. We have fifteen countries to deal with. Besides </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>, two Superior Deities will handle each country. Every superpower must be subdued within three days!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The remaining five Superior Deities will tackle </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>. It's a large nation with vast territories, so I'll personally lead the charge there. Any objections?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"None whatsoever!" came the enthusiastic reply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warriors, either newly awakened or freshly ascended to deity status, were eager to unleash their powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's hope these superpowers put up a fight! It might make things interesting; otherwise, it'll be too dull!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"See you in three days, then!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the twenty-eight Superior Deities paired up and headed off with their teams of Intermediate and Junior Deities to their assigned countries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph stayed behind with the remaining four Superior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They needed no additional support; the five of them were more than enough to sweep through </span><span>Rosmandi's</span><span> superpowers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph said, handing over the documents, "Here's the list of every superpower in </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>. There are twenty-five in total; all their locations and info are in here. Let's divide them up&mdash;how about each of us takes on five?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Newport City's Augustine family is supposedly the strongest. I'll handle them. You guys take your pick from the rest, and leave the remainder to me," Joseph declared </span><span>confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four quickly chose their targets, bowed slightly to Joseph, and swiftly departed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph scanned the documents and chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five superpowers with the Augustine family being the toughest, huh? I'll save the best for last. I'll deal with the other four first, then I'll head to Newport City and handle the Augustine family to finalize </span><span>Rosmandi's</span><span> unification!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Joseph vanished in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in the heart of the Augustine Bastion, Osborne sat cross-legged in his training chamber, surrounded by an intense aura of power that had reached its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a hum filled the air as Osborne's energy underwent a transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A second Divine Flame appeared above his head, transparent and dim at first but gradually becoming steady and strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Intermediate Deity! I've finally achieved it!" Osborne murmured to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the aid of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, it had taken him only three days to transition from Junior Deity to Intermediate Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reaching this level, Osborne felt his divine power was more robust and his Divine Body much stronger, though it hadn't fully transformed yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, even if I face a Superior Deity head-on, I won't lose half my Divine Body to their attacks. My Ethereal Glow should withstand most of their assaults. Previously, I doubted I could take on Joseph or Helios, but now... if they were to battle me, I'd likely come out on top!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A confident smile spread across Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he knew his journey was far from over. Breaking through to Intermediate Deity was just a personal milestone. Next, he aimed to complete the third stage of fusion with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, enabling the Blood Demon members to undergo metamorphosis, making them a force to be reckoned with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without pause, Osborne began the third fusion stage with the Lotus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This phase was tougher and more perilous than the second, but for Osborne, it was paradoxically easier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he needed was time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Osborne, five Superior Deity warriors from the Deschanel Clan were sweeping through </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>. With overwhelming strength, they crushed every superpower they encountered, forcing them into submission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, it would be the Augustine family's turn to face their might.</span></p></div>
