        <h1>Chapter 414 Old Adversaries</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Bruce's cane was about to pierce through Osborne's body and shatter his heart, a flash of light suddenly blocked the path of the cane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It not only halted the cane's advance but forced Bruce's body to retreat a great distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne now saw clearly that it was a sword that had forced Bruce back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a sword he recognized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes immediately revealed a look of joyful surprise, as if he had survived a catastrophe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Hernandez!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, an older figure appeared before him. With a wave of her hand, the sword flew into her grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Young man, how does it feel to be on the brink of death?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a wry smile, shaking his head. "It's terrible! I never want to experience the feeling of being on the brink of death again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then strive to become stronger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena offered a faint smile, finally turning her gaze to Bruce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bruce, you're still so despicable, hiding underwater in ambush and striking at a junior."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruce raised his eyebrows in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Serena, you have the audacity to say that? If I'm not mistaken, Medusa No. 9 was killed by you, right? She was a junior to you, yet you killed her all the same."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena smiled indifferently, "That's different! The Medusa No. 9 you mentioned wasn't really human, was she?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruce didn't respond, his face changing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, he spoke. "Serena, decades ago, our battle ended in a draw. Are you willing to fight me again now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena smiled faintly, "A draw? It seems your wounds have healed completely, and you've even forgotten the pain! Well, I didn't kill you decades ago and let you escape. Killing you now would be the same."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Arrogant!" Bruce was filled with anger. "You think you can kill me? You failed decades ago, and you can't do it now! You'll be the one to die today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued, "Once I kill you and sabotage the Draco Group's auction, your undefeated myth in Rosmandi will collapse in no time! By then, will you still be able to suppress the various chaotic forces in Rosmandi?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At that time, the Aberrants will return to Rosmandi and reclaim everything lost decades ago! The great King of the Aberrants will personally behead Godfather! And all of you, Godfather's lackeys, will die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena's face turned extremely cold at Bruce's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Decades ago, Godfather led us to defeat the Aberrants. Today, decades later, if you dare to return, you will face the same failure!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the King of the Aberrants dares to return, his head will be personally hung above the city gates by Godfather!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruce laughed. "Absurd! Stop wasting words. Let's fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, both Bruce and Serena unleashed terrifying energy, clashing with each other so fiercely that the aftermath of their combat sent Osborne flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression was grave as he intently watched the battle between the two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena and Bruce were clearly old adversaries. Their power far surpassed that of ordinary Class A masters. They were on an entirely different level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were also highly familiar with each other's moves. It seemed neither would be able to gain the upper hand in the short term.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne's face changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa No. 7 had stealthily approached him without his knowledge and suddenly launched an attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Osborne's Satan's Eye had given him a warning of danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He snorted coldly, swiftly evading Medusa No. 7's sneak attack. He then landed a heavy punch, sending her flying and causing her to spit out a mouthful of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glared at her and said coldly, "I cannot intervene in Ms. Hernandez's battle, but you dare to launch a sneak attack on me? So be it, I will kill you first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, the light from Satan's Eye burst forth, casting illusions toward Medusa No. 7.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his surprise, she was completely unaffected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa No. 7 sneered, "Psychic attacks? Sorry, my body is immune to psychic attacks!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, she attacked Osborne again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was astonished. "Medusa's body is unaffected by psychic attacks? Why is that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ineffectiveness of the Illusion Projection against Medusa No. 7 was like a reduction in his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But under normal circumstances, anyone alive could not possibly be unaffected by psychic attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Isa could not be spared entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suddenly looked up in shock, thinking, "Ms. Hernandez just said that Medusa No. 9 was not considered human! Medusa No. 7 is the same kind of existence as Medusa No. 9.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So... she is actually not human? In that case, her being unaffected by psychic attacks makes sense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this thought, Osborne punched Medusa No. 7 again, sending her flying once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at the same time, a torrential undercurrent rushed towards him from behind, washing over his body and hiding countless sharp water blades that left wounds on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another water elemental metahuman had made a move!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This person was a Class A Power Master with stronger control over water elements than Osborne's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Medusa No. 7 is unaffected by my psychic attacks; I don't believe you are either! Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne turned around suddenly. The light in Satan's Eye flickered, and the man's gaze instantly became vacant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne did not hesitate to seize the opportunity, delivering a full-powered punch towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's body exploded on the spot.</span></p></div>
