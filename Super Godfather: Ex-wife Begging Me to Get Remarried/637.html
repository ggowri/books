        <h1>Chapter 637 Head Hunting</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gripped the Goddess of Grain's scythe tightly. It was a divine artifact, not particularly powerful, but its standout features were its durability and sharpness. It was terrifyingly sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Osborne, this razor-sharp scythe was the perfect weapon for assassination. As long as he could get close to an enemy, the Goddess of Grain's scythe would easily slice through their throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No enemy could withstand its cutting edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's start with you," Osborne whispered as he targeted a lone enemy rummaging through the warehouse, seemingly searching for something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were no other enemies within one hundred yards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne picked the enemy and moved in quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, his body was just a faint black shadow moving through the darkness. It was impossible to notice him unless one specifically looked for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like David had once approached Osborne, Osborne's Satan's Eye, at full power, barely detected David's shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His enemy did not have Osborne's keen eyesight. He also never expected that there would be an enemy daring enough to sneak in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained hidden behind him, concealed in their shadow. He did not notice Osborne's approach and continued searching for things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's lips curled into a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He controlled his killing intent, knowing that true experts could sense it easily. If he revealed his intent, the enemy would instantly detect something wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tightened his grip on the Goddess of Grain's scythe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne moved. "Die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scythe, only a few feet long, looked like a curved dagger and was very easy to handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It sliced through the enemy's throat in a swift arc.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the critical moment, the enemy finally sensed something was wrong, but it was too late. He couldn't escape in time and tried to use his strength to block Osborne's attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, his defenses were as flimsy as paper against the sharp scythe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scythe cut a fine line across the enemy's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes widened, and in the next moment, his head fell to the ground with a soft thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The slight noise of the head hitting the floor went unnoticed. The enemy's wide eyes remained frozen in shock until he died, unaware of what had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood spurted from his neck, and his body slowly slumped to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was dead. A Class A enemy had been silently taken out in the warehouse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sighed in relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Killing a Class A enemy with his current strength was straightforward. The challenge was doing so without alerting more enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the enemy's body now on the ground, Osborne's plan was confirmed viable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using the dark power to hide, approach the enemy, and then use the Goddess of Grain's scythe for a quick kill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"On to the next." Osborne didn't linger and immediately locked onto the second enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The same method of assassination succeeded swiftly again. Then came the third and fourth enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued to take out heads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he had silently eliminated several isolated enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were still nine enemies left in the mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were divided into two places. One place had three enemies who seemed quite formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other place had six enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment, then decided to take out the three stronger enemies first. They were clearly the leaders of the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliminating them would make dealing with the remaining six easier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One more time, and we're done," Osborne murmured, blending back into the shadows and swiftly approaching the trio.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had become increasingly adept at controlling the dark elemental.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the three being stronger, they still didn't notice Osborne's approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Osborne was behind one of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he used the Goddess of Grain's scythe to slice through the enemy's throat. He quickly moved behind the second enemy to strike again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the first person's head suddenly flew into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other two, upon seeing this, were immediately stunned and horrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They immediately unleashed powerful defenses around themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These three were all Class AA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't have time to think. The scythe slashed through the second enemy's throat effortlessly, cutting through his defenses with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sharp sound, the second enemy's head was severed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the third enemy finally spotted Osborne's shadow. His anger and fear were evident as he launched a fierce attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying force struck Osborne's shadow, causing him to revert to his true form. But Osborne remained unperturbed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had defeated many Class AA talents at the Class A+ level, including David, Sam, and Lance. He had even beaten four Godsons of </span><span>Yalynch</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that he had become a Class AA himself, he had no fear of just one more Class AA enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He whispered, "Die."</span></p></div>
