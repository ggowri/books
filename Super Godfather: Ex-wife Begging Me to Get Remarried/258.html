        <h1>Chapter 258 Regret</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia stared at Osborne blankly. For some reason, she suddenly felt a bit regretful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was her ex-husband!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had only been a month since he divorced her. But why had he changed so much? The submissive Osborne in her eyes had disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was now tall, handsome, and confident!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia was unwilling to admit it. But seeing Osborne now, she couldn't help but feel her heart beating faster and her face flushed. It was as if she had returned seven years ago in her college days when she saw Osborne for the first time and fell in love with him right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, at that time, had also been handsome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, how could she, a daughter of a wealthy family, pursue Osborne, an orphan from an ordinary family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, after Osborne had become a part of the Caldwell family, they targeted him. Anyone could bully Osborne. In order to become the heir of the Caldwell family, she hadn't dared to speak up for Osborne. She had just let Osborne endure it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had made Osborne more taciturn and less confident. Gradually, even Ophelia had begun to look down on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she had never thought that she was the one who caused Osborne to be so inferior!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Ophelia looked at Osborne and suddenly felt that the bright Osborne was back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he was more handsome and confident than before, even more stunning!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's heart was beating fast. She stared at Osborne's face and couldn't move her eyes away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, she had really loved Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least, when they had gotten married, she really liked Osborne. But later, she had the opportunity to become the heir of the Caldwell family. The elders of the Caldwell family didn't like Osborne, and Osborne had become a burden for her. She had gradually been blinded by power and wealth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had gradually stopped paying attention to Osborne and devoted herself to fighting for the position of heir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To secure the position of heir, she had even aborted her child with Osborne without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia had known Osborne was sorrowful, but she hadn't comforted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, when she had become the heir, she chose to divorce Osborne without hesitation because she felt that Osborne was no longer worthy of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she wanted to lead the Caldwell family to develop and make it a more powerful family, she could only find someone whose status and position were not inferior to hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley was her target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he didn't care that she had been married and wanted to form a strong alliance with the Caldwell family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them hit it off immediately and prepared for the wedding in just one month, even though there was actually no love between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia had once thought that she would never regret divorcing Osborne. She had felt Wesley was the more suitable person for her, and Wesley was a hundred times better than Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In every aspect, she had thought Wesley was stronger than Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Ophelia's thoughts suddenly loosened a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Is it really worth divorcing Osborne to marry Wesley and join forces with the Ashford family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia bit her lip, looking confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Naturally, Wesley saw her abnormality. Seeing Ophelia staring at Osborne blankly, even with some regret in her eyes, Wesley suddenly became angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Osborne fiercely, his eyes full of anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! How dare you to come here!" shouted Wesley sternly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, all the Ashford family's bodyguards gathered around and stared at Osborne with unfriendly expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was not panicked but smiled, "Why shouldn't I dare to come? If I'm not wrong, you invited me to participate not long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that I'm here, don't you seem to welcome me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you scared?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley suddenly didn't know what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking for a moment, he said angrily, "What a joke! How could I be afraid? Loser, I just didn't expect you to come here to humiliate yourself! Your beloved ex-wife abandoned you. She is going to marry me and hold such a grand wedding. Do you feel upset?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"On the contrary, I'm glad! I'm glad that she divorced me, and I'm even more glad that you are going to hold such a grand wedding."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, Ophelia immediately bit her lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing. I just want to congratulate you. Well, it is almost the wedding time. Don't worry about me. I can go in by myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, Osborne walked towards the castle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguards of the Ashford family immediately stopped him and looked at Wesley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley hesitated but finally waved his hand. "Let him in! Since he wants to watch me and Ophelia's wedding, let him watch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't let others think that the Ashford family is mean!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, the Ashford family bodyguards dispersed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and walked into the castle without saying anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley looked at his back with a gloomy expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ophelia, go get ready first. I have some things to do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley gritted his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wesley, what are you going to do? Don't be impulsive. The wedding is about to begin. Don't create any accidents," said Ophelia worriedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley sneered, "Don't worry. There won't be any accidents! Today, this is my home </span><span>ground, and he is just a loser. Since he dares to come, I will make him become a joke!"</span></p></div>
