        <h1>Chapter 1190 Kill Cain</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'd rather die than let you walk away unscathed!" Cain roared, his fractured soul igniting with an intense, fiery fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, an overwhelming surge of power exploded from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart raced with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't let his guard down; he instantly summoned his Ethereal Glow, encasing himself in a protective barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he had completed the second stage of fusion with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity and gained a form of immortality&mdash;able to revive even after his body was destroyed&mdash;there were limits to how many times he could come back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne certainly didn't want to waste that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What stunned Osborne was that even in his diminished state, Cain was still capable of unleashing such incredible strength. The threat he posed when he claimed he could take down any Intermediate Deity suddenly felt much more real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew&mdash;he had to tread carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Ethereal Glow was, in fact, an evolved version of his previous martial art aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After reaching Junior Deity status, the transformation had made his Ethereal Glow far more potent than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The martial art aura had already bestowed him with outrageous defense; now, the Ethereal Glow elevated that protection to a whole new level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trusting in his Ethereal Glow, Osborne felt a bit more at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the Ethereal Glow was completely transparent, lacking any color, just like the glow of a Waste Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing Osborne's Ethereal Glow, Cain couldn't help but burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was twisted in disdain as he jeered, "You? A pathetic loser with just a Waste Divine Body? You think you can take me out? You're probably one of the weakest Junior Deities around! Any regular Junior Deity could wipe the floor with you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you think you can kill me? I'll make sure you regret ever crossing paths with me! You're forcing me to burn my soul&mdash;I'll make it my mission to ensure you regret every moment you're alive in this world!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Cain suddenly struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted, "Pathetic fool, die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once I burn my soul, I can never return to my peak, nor possess the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity again. You've made me pay a terrible price, and I'm going to make you suffer for it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An unmistakable power surged forth from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain was clearly not bluffing; the force he unleashed was no joke, far from what any regular Junior Deity could muster. Whether he could actually take down an Intermediate Deity remained an unanswered question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Osborne had yet to encounter an Intermediate Deity, so he couldn't gauge their true strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Cain had once been a Deity Overlord&mdash;he wasn't likely to exaggerate on that front.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Osborne's expression shifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sensed something about Cain's furious assault&mdash;it didn't seem as powerful as he expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Remaining still, Osborne simply let his Ethereal Glow rise in defense, allowing Cain's onslaught to crash against the shimmering barrier encasing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he was engulfed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain's attack sent shockwaves throughout the underground chamber, causing it to collapse, stirring up dust and debris, and triggering a minor earthquake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But rather than reveling in victory, Cain appeared utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized with horror that his strike hadn't breached Osborne's Ethereal Glow!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, shielded by the protective layer, emerged completely unharmed, standing firm as Cain's burning soul attack simply bounced off him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this even possible?" Cain exclaimed, his disbelief mounting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought he must have been seeing things, but as the dust began to dissipate, there stood Osborne, resolutely enveloped in his transparent Ethereal Glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain was left speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wore a cold smile as he glared at Cain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this the power you boasted about, the kind that could take down any Intermediate Deity? This level of strength? It's far too disappointing! I even got a little worried for a moment..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each step he took towards Cain, Osborne's disdain grew more evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain's eyes were filled with shock. "This can't be! You have a Waste Divine Body! Your Ethereal Glow is colorless, exactly like that of a Waste Divine Body. How could you be so powerful?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just a Junior Deity, yet you withstood my attack after I burnt my soul. Even an Intermediate Deity shouldn't have been able to withstand it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain roared, his desperation mounting as Osborne approached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce bite of his teeth, he unleashed another attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the result was the same. Cain's assault hit Osborne's Ethereal Glow, causing only a ripple before dissipating into nothingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This can't be! Even the defenses of a Superior Deity aren't this strong!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain was utterly dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled coldly. "Is that so? Well, that's just perfect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now, it's my turn to strike. You, the God of Sin, can go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne threw a punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he only used about half his strength, it was devastating. The underground passage crumbled instantly, triggering a violent earthquake. Sections of the tunnel collapsed one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Cain's fragmented soul was struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain's shattered soul exploded under the force of the punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! I can't accept this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain's anguished cry echoed, quickly fading into silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was dead!</span></p></div>
