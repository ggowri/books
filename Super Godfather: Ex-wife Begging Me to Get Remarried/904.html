        <h1>Chapter 904 Top-tier Class S Powerhouse</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you're dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The roar echoed through the arena, filled with a chilling murderous intent that caused the stunned crowd to shiver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen, who was originally on the high stands, had somehow made his way to the stage, clutching his son Marlon, now a twisted and broken figure. Rumen trembled violently, his face contorted with rage, and his aura was a storm of vengeance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marlon was gravely injured!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only had his bones been shattered by Osborne's kick, but his blood, flesh, and internal organs had suffered catastrophic trauma. His very soul suffered the brutal impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite advances in medicine that could easily mend broken bones, even regrow limbs through cloning technology.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marlon's injuries were far beyond repair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Restoring him to his peak condition would be almost impossible, and Rumen knew it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he not be furious?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marlon was his finest son. As the head of the Thornberry family and one of the vice leaders of the League of Divine Descent, Rumen was surged with unreasonable rage and revenge after watching his child reduced to this state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze locked on Osborne, as though he were a predator </span><span>read</span><span>y to devour his prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overwhelming energy from the rage of a top-tier Class S Supreme Overlord was not something anyone could easily withstand, and even Osborne felt a hard hit, his complexion paling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen shouted again, fury crackling in the air, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you're dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How dare you injure my son so severely? I'll make you pay back! I want the blood of every member of the Augustine family for what you've done to my Marlon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen rose, still carrying his son, and began to approach Osborne, a terrifying power radiating from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop right there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A figure leaped in front of Osborne. It was Wesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson's gaze was steely as he confronted Rumen. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think you're doing, Rumen? This is the Honor Quest Ceremony! Your son Marlon was defeated by Osborne simply because he wasn't strong enough! He was in injuries because of his own inability! If every elder of every family sought revenge for their injured kid, we might as well cancel the Honor Quest Ceremony altogether!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or is it that the Thornberry family can't handle a loss?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Wesson's words, Rumen scoffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wesson, who do you think you are? Your opinion doesn't matter here. Back off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Rumen unleashed his power, a wave of force crashing into Wesson. There was no way Wesson could dodge it; he couldn't because Osborne was right behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce shout, Wesson pushed back with all he had, but the gap in their strength was huge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen wasn't just any Class S. He was among the top fifty in the Global Quasi-Divine Rankings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a top-tier Class S warrior!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not even Sebastian or Gerardo could match Rumen's rank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson was hit hard, blood spewing from his mouth as he couldn't withstand the onslaught and was thrown backwards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in horror as he rushed forward, catching Wesson who was falling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying energy surged against Osborne, forcing him to stumble back a few feet to regain his balance, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a monstrous force!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression hardened. He met Rumen's icy gaze, refusing to back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen sneered, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got some guts! But do you really think you stand a chance against me? You've hurt my son, and now I'll ruin you! You're going to pay dearly for this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen struck with an overwhelming force the moment he finished the words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep within Rumen's eyes, a deadly rage simmered. He was determined to kill Osborne, but it wasn't just because Marlon lay gravely injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than that, Rumen sensed the looming threat that Osborne posed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had just cleared the Honor Quest Ceremony, becoming the fourth person in history to do so</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>a living legend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Rumen didn't eliminate Osborne now, the young man would undoubtedly continue to grow stronger. In fact, the top three individuals who had previously succeeded in the Honor Quest had all eventually made it to the top ten of the Global Quasi-Divine Rankings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Osborne wasn't as powerful as they were, he wouldn't be far behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he fully matured, he could become a real threat to Rumen himself, endangering </span><span>the Thornberry family and potentially the entire League of Divine Descent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this nagging realization weighing on him, Rumen knew he had to act before Osborne could rise to power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson's voice rang out, panic flooding his words as he caught sight of Rumen's lethal intent. He understood precisely what the man was scheming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was too bright a star.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the League of Divine Descent had long coveted the rare metals mine in </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>. If Osborne grew in strength, their plans would undoubtedly be derailed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen's intention to kill Osborne was crystal clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson's urgency boiled over as he shouted, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Flores! It</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s on the Honor Quest Ceremony! Rumen's trying to kill Osborne! Are you just going to stand by and let it happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Wesson spoke, Rumen turned his icy glare toward Jackie Flores.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With an indifferent demeanor, Jackie replied, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, but the Honor Quest Ceremony is already over."</span></p></div>
