        <h1>Chapter 1095 Begs for Mercy</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett's face darkened. He glared at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett looked at Osborne's youthful face and couldn't help feeling dazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a few months ago, Everett met Osborne for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, if Everett's memory served him right, Osborne was merely a Class A. Everett had led the younger generation of the Rosenthal family to compete against the Augustine family in a high-stakes gamble. Each one from Rosenthal's side was at least Class AA. Yet, Osborne, being only Class A, had managed to turn the tables completely, making Everett lose two divine artifacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of those artifacts was the Goddess of Grain's scythe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Everett stared at the scythe in Osborne's hand, regret gnawed at him. The scythe wasn't an actual divine artifact. Aside from being sharp and durable, it had no other special abilities. At the time, Everett hadn't given it much thought at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, in Osborne's hands, the scythe had become a weapon of death. It didn't need any extra abilities. Its sheer durability and sharpness, combined with Osborne's terrifying strength, were enough to strike fear into anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The way Osborne wielded it, it was more deadly than the top-grade divine artifact Everett had ever seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regret surged through Everett. But more than that, he regretted not having killed Osborne back then, no matter the cost. Had he known Osborne would grow this powerful in such a short time, even the intervention of Night wouldn't have stopped him from reporting the matter to the League of Divine Descent and having someone else handle Osborne for good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Class A insect Everett had barely noticed months ago had grown into a force that could decide his fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett regretted it but could only plaster a smile and said, "Osborne, the League of Divine Descent was wrong to help the Aberrants attack the Augustine family. For that, we are willing to apologize. The League will certainly provide the Augustines with satisfactory compensation. Whatever you want, name it, and we will meet your demands!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow at this. The League of Divine Descent was an immense and formidable force composed of 36 Divine families, each nearly as strong, if not stronger, than the Augustine family. That would be ideal if there was any way to avoid becoming mortal enemies with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had no desire to engage in a life-or-death battle with the League of Divine Descent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But, unfortunately, it was too late for that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian had already killed Rumen, and Osborne had slain Armstrong with his own hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen was the vice leader of the League of Divine Descent and the head of the most powerful family within the League, the Thornberry family. On the other hand, Armstrong was the former head of the same family. Both of them were the son and grandson of Helios Thornberry, the greatest warrior on Blue Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Rumen and Armstrong had been killed, how could the League of Divine Descent possibly let the Augustine family off the hook? Reconciliation was no longer on the table. And as for the nearly one hundred Class S warriors of the League who had gathered, there was no way Osborne would allow anyone to walk away alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more of them Osborne took down now, the fewer would remain to seek revenge on the Augustine family later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Everett seemed still unaware that Osborne had killed Armstrong. Everett thought he could bargain with compensation to save his own life. Osborne figured he could take advantage of this situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mind raced. Then, he sneered, "Compensation? I don't need it! But I have no desire to be enemies with the League of Divine Descent either. Letting you go, though? That's not happening. Unless you do something for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett's face lit up at Osborne's words. He thought, "As long as there is room for negotiation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett asked, "What do you want us to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled as he looked at the 300 Class S clones in the distance. He said coldly, "Help me wipe them out. Your League of Divine Descent helped the Aberrants slaughter the Augustines before. Now, help me kill them to atone for your sins. That's not too much to ask, is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Osborne finished speaking, Everett's face twisted in alarm. Those were over 300 Class S clones, nearly four times their numbers. While Everett didn't think much of any single Class S clone, their sheer number made the situation far more dangerous. Even if they managed to wipe all the clones out, the cost to his own forces would be significant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett frowned, weighing the risks and rewards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression grew colder. "It seems you're unwilling? It doesn't matter. I had hoped to avoid becoming enemies with the League of Divine Descent, but this is your choice. The deaths of my family members must be avenged, and someone has to answer for it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne raised his hand, and in an instant, over 4,800 Blood Demon warriors encircled Everett and his men. Each one glared at them with icy determination, their eyes brimming with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett's face turned pale. They had already seen the combat prowess of the Blood Demon members earlier. Though they were only Class AAA, their coordination was terrifying. Everett would rather face those 300 Class S clones than battle these 4,800 Blood Demon fighters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a heartbeat, Everett made his decision. "Fine! We agree! We'll help you kill those clones, but you have to guarantee that you won't attack us once it's done!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly, "Very well. I swear, as long as you eliminate all of those Class S clones from the Aberrants and refrain from attacking us, I will not harm you, and you can walk away freely."</span></p></div>
