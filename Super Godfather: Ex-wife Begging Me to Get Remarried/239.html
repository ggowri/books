        <h1>Chapter 239 Strange Singing</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each metahuman was indeed not to be underestimated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In recent years, the </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> order had crumbled, with crime syndicates running rampant, capitalists exploiting the common folk, and metahumans wielding power over the world, becoming its true rulers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a century of conflict, a fragile balance had finally been struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Metahumans generally refrained from interfering in the lives of ordinary people, especially those classified as Class A and above, who rarely took matters into their own hands due to their overwhelming destructive capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of their attacks could rival the force of artillery, easily causing widespread devastation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, in the absence of Class A metahumans, Class B+ stood as the most formidable entities that ordinary folks would encounter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many ancient families counted their strongest members among the Class B+.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as an ancient family had a Class B+ metahuman in their ranks, they would not easily fade into obscurity and could continue their legacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, however, Osborne found himself facing four Class B+ metahumans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the heat of the moment, he realized he had underestimated their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he had previously taken down Orion, a Class B+, that didn't mean he could dismiss every Class B+ metahuman&mdash;let alone four working together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was now in a precarious situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The metahuman manipulating gravity had him pinned in place, rendering him unable to dodge the onslaught of raging winds and flames. Meanwhile, the ice-wielding metahuman was firing arrows of ice from a distance, aiming to pierce through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with his level three Devil's Light, it was impossible to fend off such relentless attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted, yet he remained calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can control me with gravity? Dream on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a mental command, the space in front of him tore open, revealing a dimensional rift that quickly engulfed his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything happened in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek and the others were caught off guard, their faces reflecting sheer shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek murmured, "A dimensional rift? Spatial power? Is that Orion from the Lark family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, Derek shouted, "No way! This isn't Orion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch out! That guy has spatial power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could react, a faint energy ripple appeared behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't have time to turn around and bolted forward, but it was too late!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dimensional rift opened right behind Derek, and Osborne emerged from it, launching a powerful strike without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His palm, enveloped in yellow Devil's Light, slammed into Derek's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flames surrounding Derek flared wildly, unable to withstand the force of the Devil's Light. He coughed up a mouthful of blood and was sent crashing to the ground, struggling to rise as he looked at Osborne in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How... how could you possibly wield spatial power? Who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled. "Want to know? I won't tell you. After all, a dead man doesn't need to know too much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne unleashed a blast of Devil's Light aimed straight at Derek's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek's face went pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a violent whirlwind erupted in front of Derek, wrapping around his body and whisking him away to safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Devil's Light struck the ground, leaving a massive crater in its wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne felt the weight of gravity pressing down on him again, making it difficult to even lift his arms. Countless ice arrows flew toward him, piercing through the air like deadly missiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a pity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had hoped to take down Derek first and then systematically deal with the rest. But things hadn't gone as planned; Derek had managed to counter his attack just in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his spatial power already exposed, any chance of a successful surprise attack was slim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew that taking on all four of them with his current strength would be an uphill battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he managed to pull it off, he'd have to go all out, reveal all his cards, and risk serious injuries in the process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, instead of continuing this hopeless struggle, he decided to change his approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Osborne suddenly emitted a signal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next heartbeat, a soft, ethereal melody began to play, filling everyone's ears. </span><span>The tune was hauntingly beautiful, as though it was drifting from a distant diamond mine, far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter who it was, the moment they heard the melody, they froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every single person, even the heavily wounded Derek, was caught off guard, their attention irresistibly drawn to the song.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is this strange song?" Derek murmured, his face showing signs of struggle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed to be trying to block out the melody but was unable to, instead finding himself compelled to listen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't just Derek; the other three Class B+ metahumans were in the same boat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite knowing they should be attacking Osborne and not giving him a moment to breathe, they couldn't help but listen intently to the song.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they were affected, the rest of the people in the diamond mine were even more so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apart from Osborne and Valentin, who had already donned noise-canceling headphones, everyone else stood in place, entranced by the melody.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, their expressions grew vacant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stood motionless, their eyes glazed over, swaying with the rhythm of the song, sinking deeper into its influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Osborne chuckled with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here's my chance! Kill them!"</span></p></div>
