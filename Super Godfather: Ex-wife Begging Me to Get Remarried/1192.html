        <h1>Chapter 1191 Repository of Knowledge</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a surge of satisfaction after effortlessly defeating Cain with a single punch. Although the encounter had its surprises&mdash;Cain's fractured soul unleashed unexpected power&mdash;the outcome was ultimately in Osborne's favor. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his real goal wasn't just to defeat Cain; it was to obtain Cain's memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting time, Osborne activated his Satan's Eye. In an instant, he captured the remnants of Cain's memories before they faded away with his shattered soul. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The process was much easier than Osborne had anticipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Satan's Eye is incredibly powerful now!" he marveled. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally a mutated version, it had undergone a significant transformation, enhanced by the core energy of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. It had reached an unprecedented Level Eight and evolved deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne felt that Satan's Eye was becoming almost too powerful. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder how my Medusa's Gaze will evolve after absorbing core energy from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I can't wait to find out!" he thought, excitement bubbling within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now wasn't the time for daydreaming. With his ocular energy locked onto Cain's memories, he began the extraction process. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne was overwhelmed by a torrent of noise and chaos as Cain's vast memories flooded his mind. It was like drowning in a sea of images and sensations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The memories of a battle-hardened Deity Overlord&mdash;a life marked by sin and bloodshed&mdash;crashed into Osborne's mind. The sheer volume was dizzying, making it impossible to process everything at once. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Cain was a Deity Overlord whose lifespan stretched over countless millennia, far beyond Osborne's twenty-something years. The magnitude of Cain's memories threatened to overwhelm Osborne's sense of self.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I try to absorb all this, I'll become delirious and lose my own identity! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't let these memories consume me. If I do, who will I become&mdash;Osborne or Cain?" he thought, furrowing his brow in distress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing the danger, he decided not to fully accept Cain's memories. Instead, he sealed them deep within his mind, treating them as a vast repository of knowledge. Whenever he needed insight, he could search through Cain's memories. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This way, he wouldn't gain immediate access to Cain's extensive combat experience or techniques, but his mind would remain intact and orderly. He could learn what he needed over time without risking chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Osborne locked away Cain's memories, he breathed a sigh of relief. "Done at last! Now, let's see if there's anything in Cain's memories about safely completing the third, fourth, or even fifth integration with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he sifted through the memories, Osborne's excitement quickly turned to anger. "That damned bastard! He played me for a fool! He has no clue how to safely integrate with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity! Sure, he has experience, but the process is fraught with danger, and he doesn't know how to avoid it! What a scoundrel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Osborne had never fully trusted Cain, and when the opportunity arose, he </span><span>eliminated him without hesitation. "Well, at least I took care of him! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, no one knows that I possess the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. This secret must be kept safe; only those I trust completely can know about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne delved deeper into Cain's memories. Among the countless experiences from Cain's millennia-long life, the predominant themes were battles, narrow escapes, and bloodshed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain had risen from obscurity to become a Deity Overlord, facing innumerable dangers and seizing countless opportunities along the way. His life was a legend in its own right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne quickly scoured Cain's memories, he realized the wealth of insights on the journey from Junior Deity to Deity Overlord. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've got it!" he exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain had also mastered various secret techniques, skills, and cultivation experiences, all of which could greatly benefit Osborne. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, truly making them his own would take time. "Cain's memories are like a treasure trove! I'll need to dig through them whenever I get the chance&mdash;there's so much here that could elevate my power. But for now, I should make my exit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne prepared to leave, casting one last glance around, marveling at the place that had become his "land of opportunity." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just two short days, his strength had skyrocketed. Though only a Junior Deity, Osborne had ascended to a whole new level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time to go!" he declared.</span></p></div>
