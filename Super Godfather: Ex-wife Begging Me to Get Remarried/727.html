        <h1>Chapter 727 Owen's Challenge</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne stepped into the Draco Group headquarters in Dampston, he found the place buzzing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew, Owen, and Lance had all gathered, and even the injured Vincent had made his way back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the look on Vincent's face was anything but pleasant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been forced to return to the Augustine family headquarters in Newport City for treatment due to his serious injuries, which had caused him to withdraw from the heir selection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Vincent wasn't one to back down easily. As the strongest among the younger generation of the Augustine family, he couldn't accept being sidelined. So, despite not being fully healed, he applied to rejoin the competition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His request was granted, and Vincent returned to the front lines, ready to make a comeback and chase down points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to his dismay, he discovered that the Aberrants had retreated, and the war was over!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Vincent not be furious?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He found himself ranked fifth on the leaderboard, just above Lance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent was convinced that with another two weeks, he could easily break into the top three and even surpass Osborne to reclaim the first position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, that opportunity was gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The war had ended, and so had the heir selection. No matter how much he resented it, he was stuck in fifth place, barred from becoming the Augustine family's heir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Vincent spotted Osborne, his anger flared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Vincent's eyes, the top spot in the heir selection should have been his. Even though Osborne's points far exceeded everyone else's, Vincent couldn't shake the belief that he was destined to win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was confident that he was the strongest among the younger generation of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent believed that if Osborne could achieve something, he could do it too&mdash;perhaps even better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Osborne was just a member of a branch bloodline of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This only fueled Vincent's resentment even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent scoffed, glaring at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be honest. You're only in first place because I had an accident! If we did this again, I'd easily take the top spot. You wouldn't stand a chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone turned their gaze toward Osborne, their expressions a mix of disbelief and intrigue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the heir selection, none of them had believed Osborne could claim first place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not to mention the first, nobody even thought Osborne had a chance of making it into the top three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was he a branch bloodline member, but he was also too young and had the weakest standing among the six potential heirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His supporting forces were also the least formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given all that, who would have thought Osborne would end up laughing last, securing the top position with points that dwarfed the competition?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even now, they considered his success a stroke of luck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to their intel, Osborne's high score was largely thanks to his girlfriend, Clarissa, who had helped him take down one Class AAA Evolved Human after another, leading to his impressive lead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In light of this, how could they possibly accept his victory?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you're just riding on your girlfriend's coattails to get that first place. Don't you feel ashamed?" Owen chimed in, teeth clenched in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was equally irked, having teamed up with Lance only to fall short of Matthew by a mere three hundred points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for Osborne, he believed he would have claimed third place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged, a faint smile on his face. "First place is first place. Who cares how I got there? Did you earn every single one of your points all on your own? Did you personally take down those Class AAA powerhouses from the Aberrants? I doubt you could handle even one on your own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you still dare to challenge me? Who gave you the audacity?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, to which Owen's face turned angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He balled his fists, saying, "You only got lucky finding a good girlfriend. Have the guts to fight me one-on-one! If you lose, step down as the first heir of the Augustine family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you dare?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen taunted Osborne with his defiant gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne burst into laughter, looking down on him with disdain. "Owen, are you nuts? Why would I accept your challenge? Losing means giving up the position of the first heir of the Augustine family. You think I'm as daft as you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember, from now on, I am the first heir of the Augustine family. Unless anything unforeseen happens, I'll be the head of the Augustine family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you still want to waste my time with your nonsense? Believe me, I can use my authority as the first heir of the Augustine family to lock you up in the dungeon, and you'll never see daylight again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Owen was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face turned red with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to continue speaking but was pulled back by the fifth elder, Dalton Augustine, who shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Owen, enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen clenched his fists but eventually didn't dare to say anything more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the look he shot at Osborne was filled with malice, rage, and hatred.</span></p></div>
