        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intense commotion seemed like it would blow off the castle's roof.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone stared dumbfounded at Clarissa and Osborne kissing, their faces filled with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could suppress the turmoil in their hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "Who was Clarissa Radcliffe?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was the eldest daughter of the ancient Radcliffe family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was the top beauty in </span><span>Skyefall</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was the </span><span>Fatebearer</span><span> of the Radcliffe family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was high above, like a goddess, always displaying a cold demeanor to everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet now, she voluntarily kissed Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia was equally shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Osborne and Clarissa kissing, Ophelia felt something inside her shatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This must be an illusion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia murmured, closing her eyes tightly, hoping that when she reopened them, this illusion would vanish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Osborne would still be the useless ex-husband in my eyes, a bottom-tier commoner who was unworthy of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa would still be the unattainable goddess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could there be any connection between them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, when Ophelia opened her eyes again, she still saw Clarissa and Osborne kissing passionately, oblivious to their surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's eyes instantly turned red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could not understand why Clarissa would fall for someone as worthless as Osborne. She knew Osborne's abilities better than anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had dated for four years and were married for three!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could not wait to divorce him and remarry, so how could Clarissa fall for him? It made no sense!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Clarissa had been bewitched!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, that had to be it! Osborne had used some insidious trick to deceive her. I had to expose him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia was extremely angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mentality had completely become unbalanced. She thought, "If Osborne really ended up with Clarissa, what did that make me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would I be seen as blind?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, who I had looked down on and divorced, found a girlfriend more beautiful, of higher status, and better in every way than me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How would others think of me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I would become the laughingstock of everyone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking this, Ophelia's body trembled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way!" she </span><span>suddenly shouted,</span><span> her eyes bloodshot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne and Clarissa, lost in their passionate kiss, didn't notice her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long while, they finally parted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A crystalline thread connected their lips, making Clarissa's face flush instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She buried her face in Osborne's chest, too shy to lift her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly and whispered, "Clarissa, are you ready? From now on, we will face all the difficulties and bear our fate together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's body shook, and she nodded firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I am ready! No matter how difficult the future is, no matter how many people try to stop us, I will stand by your side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From this moment on, I will always belong to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body also trembled, and he was deeply moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded vigorously. "Alright! Then let's face together! No one can separate us, and no one can take you away from me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne's gaze turned cold and resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held Clarissa's hand and finally looked at the stunned crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled slightly and announced, "Everyone, I have something to declare. I am Clarissa's boyfriend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Clarissa looked up at Osborne with eyes full of affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She also said, "That is right! I am Osborne's girlfriend! I will only be his girlfriend for the rest of my life. We are together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surroundings became eerily quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was utterly shocked and even felt numb, that Osborne and Clarissa publicly </span><span>announced their relationship on such an occasion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the crowd, Donna's face turned incredibly gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, she just sighed without interfering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Clarissa, why were you doing this? Is this really called fate? Choosing the hardest path, was there really a future?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna looked at Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was smiling happily, her face full of gentleness. Whenever she looked at Osborne, her gaze could melt any man's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But unfortunately, she only looked at Osborne this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna knew Clarissa was happy now, and as her aunt who watched her grow up, Donna was happy for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, thinking about the difficult path ahead, the upcoming matters, the opposition from everyone, and even potential life-threatening dangers, Donna could not be cheerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Well, at least she was happy now! Even if they could not be together in the future, this would be a precious memory for her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna finally showed a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, I have a gift for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suddenly said to Clarissa.</span></p></div>
