        <h1>Chapter 1509 Spark Estate</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback. "Neighbors? This manor belongs to you too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within a 2-mile radius of his newly purchased manor, there were no other buildings except for another similar manor beyond a small hill on the right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had used his Satan's Eye to observe it from afar, finding no trace of human habitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman halted, smiling. "Indeed! I'll be staying here for a while, as your neighbor. When I have time, I'll often drop by. You won't mind, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne fell silent, thinking, "No wonder I felt these two manors were similar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They both belonged to the same person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This woman didn't live here before, but now she's moving in as my neighbor. What exactly is she up to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Regardless, thank you for selling me this manor. As long as you have no malicious intent, you're always welcome to visit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's settled then!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"See you tomorrow!" the woman said, walking directly into the manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took out a colorful Token, waved it at Osborne, and activated it with divine power. Instantly, a divine power shield emerged from the manor, enveloping it entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ordinary people could no longer see inside the manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne attempted to observe it with his Satan's Eye and found that he could see through it. However, after a moment of hesitation, he refrained from prying further and returned to his own manor with his companions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also took out the colorful Token and activated it with divine power, creating a similar divine power shield that covered his entire manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a treasure!" Osborne muttered, testing the strength of the divine power shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He found that even he would need to use more than 80% of his power to break it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes lit up. "Just this divine power shield alone is probably not cheap!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who is this woman? Why is she approaching me? What are her intentions?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't figure it out and shook his head, dismissing his thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this divine power shield, the manor was safer. Even if someone wanted to attack them, they would have to break the shield first, giving them a warning and preventing any surprise attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, breaking through this defensive barrier would require the strength of someone at the peak of the Celestial Deity realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Furthermore, it consumes Essence Crystals! In special circumstances, consuming more Essence Crystals can make this divine power barrier even stronger! Even a Deity Overlord warrior would find it difficult to break through forcefully! And as for me, I don't lack Essence Crystals!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne smiled. "This will be Spark of Blaze's stronghold from now on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of his hand, a huge stone slab flew up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne's divine power surged, words appeared on the slab: [Spark Estate!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, this is Spark Estate!" Osborne declared, waving the huge slab to hang above the manor's gatehouse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the sign, everyone felt excited. The despair and gloom on their faces had long disappeared, replaced only by hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, let's settle down quickly. We're likely to face many troubles ahead. Everyone should rest well and strive to improve your strength."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone nodded vigorously at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that settled, the members of Spark of Blaze began to settle into the manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, as the leader, took up residence in the most secluded part of the estate&mdash;a luxurious mansion surrounded by beautiful scenery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty, Thera, and Sophia chose to stay nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, Osborne intended to have Darren live close by as well, given Darren's position as one of Spark of Blaze's deputy leaders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Darren opted to stay with his comrade, and Osborne respected his choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once everything was in order, Osborne called Betty and Darren aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lachlan Swift!" they addressed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, producing two Dimensional Bags.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These Dimensional Bags contain a total of two million Essence Crystals, mostly mid-grade. Distribute them among the members for their cultivation. Push them to improve their strength as quickly as possible. Don't hold back, and if these run out, I can provide more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The goal is to ensure everyone has ample Essence Crystals for their training. How to divide them is up to the two of you to decide."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty and Darren's eyes widened in shock. They stared at the Dimensional Bags in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two million Essence Crystals? And mostly mid-grade?" Betty exclaimed, her voice tinged with awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was equivalent to over 200 million low-grade Essence Crystals&mdash;a sum she'd never even imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Darren, a former Deity Overlord warrior, had never laid eyes on such wealth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lachlan Swift, this is an enormous amount!" Betty gasped, her voice trembling slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darren nodded in agreement. "Indeed, Mr. Lachlan Swift, it's too much! We are all crippled now, our divine power essence destroyed. We can't cultivate anymore, so we don't need Essence Crystals."</span></p></div>
