Without hesitation, he activated the technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Breath of Celestial was not just a power booster for Osborne; it was also a masterful Glacium skill that offered unparalleled control over energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne aimed to use it to manage the overwhelming blood energy threatening to rupture his body. He intended to compress it and maybe even use it to enhance the Breath of Celestial itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he wasn't entirely sure it would work, it was his only hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it failed, Osborne would be doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body, bones, and Blood Cross were already at their limit, unable to absorb any more blood energy. Yet, Mosley continued to pour the terrifying energy into him through her mouthpart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a solution, his body would explode into a bloody mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Osborne's plan began to work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Breath of Celestial took effect, he gained control over the massive amount of blood energy, compressing it and channeling it into his bones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expanding body started to shrink back to normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mosley was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! This can't be happening!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible? Such a vast amount of blood energy should be beyond your body's capacity! It could turn an ordinary person's bones into Divine Bones and their body into a Divine Body! How could you absorb it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There must be something wrong!" Mosley roared in frustration, but she had no other options.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She only ramped up the flow of energy through her mouthpart, trying desperately to burst Osborne open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne, having managed to compress and control the energy, was no longer in danger of explosion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smile spread across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's really working! However, while the Breath of Celestial can compress this energy and alleviate my immediate problem, how can I best use this compressed energy to boost my power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pondered this just as Mosley's words echoed in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine Bones? Divine Body?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes lit up. He thought, "Could the enormous blood energy really transform an ordinary person's bones into Divine Bones and their body into a Divine Body?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart raced with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I could have Divine Bones or a Divine Body, how powerful would I become? Should I give it a shot?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly made up his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "This blood energy comes from Mosley, a Dark Deity, and is infused with divine power. This kind of divine energy could fundamentally change my physiology and grant me Divine Bones or even a Divine Body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I miss this chance, I might never get another opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Here goes nothing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gritted his teeth and decided to take the risk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne swiftly funneled the compressed blood energy into his right leg bone. If it failed, he would only lose a leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his Light of Redemption, he could eventually heal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the energy surged into his right leg, Osborne watched in awe as his leg bone erupted in dazzling light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cracks spread across his leg like a spider's web.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, the Powerstone, a divine artifact in his abdomen, suddenly stirred. It seemed to melt and merge into his right leg bone, pulsing with a new, intense energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the cracks on Osborne's right leg bone vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Has the Powerstone I acquired from killing Cuthbert truly merged completely with my leg?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leg bone, now fused with the Powerstone, had become incredibly resilient. No matter how much blood energy was poured into it, it remained uncracked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A brilliant light erupted from his leg bone, signaling what seemed to be a profound transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mosley was astonished. "How is this possible? Your leg bone is transforming into a Divine Bone? This can't be! You're just a mortal, not even a Lesser God! How can your bones withstand such immense power?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! I refuse to believe it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, meanwhile, was both amazed and terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His bone structure should never have been able to handle such a surge of energy and transform into Divine Bones under normal circumstances. But with the Powerstone's integration, his leg bone's strength had rapidly increased, meeting the necessary threshold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As more blood energy flowed into his leg bone, its brilliance intensified. A faint divine power radiated from it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, the transformation was complete. His leg bone had successfully evolved into a Divine Bone.</span></p></div>
