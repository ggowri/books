        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dawn, Osborne prepared to head over to the Radcliffe Manor for work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His primary focus now was to complete the Godfather's heir test as swiftly as possible. That was to secure the position of Clarissa's head bodyguard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His time spent with Barlyn the previous day had given him some insight into Barlyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had also devised a clear plan now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dealing with Barlyn required a different approach than with Paul. Unlike Paul, Barlyn wasn't a spy, and they were, in fact, friends now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To become the head bodyguard, Osborne needed Barlyn to resign voluntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The primary reason Barlyn took the bodyguard job was financial; Donna had canceled his credit cards and controlled his finances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The previous day, Osborne had taken Barlyn to earn some money, hoping to alleviate his financial concerns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With money in hand, Barlyn might consider quitting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But simply having cash wasn't enough. Osborne planned to make Barlyn experience the harsh realities and challenges of being a bodyguard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only by doing so would Barlyn be motivated to resign sooner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, Osborne was ready to put his plan into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That guy's a wine aficionado, especially when it comes to high-end reds. Today, I'm going to show him what real top-shelf wine tastes like!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked, opening the Draco Star Wristlet's shopping mall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, the mall offered an array of items, including weapons, explosives, luxury cars, and high-end watches, as well as cigars and fine wines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne navigated to the wine section, where a dazzling selection of prestigious bottles awaited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he wasn't a wine expert, he knew that price didn't lie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The higher the price, the better the wine. He zeroed in on the three most expensive red wines available.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The third most expensive was Glacium Beauty, a top-tier red wine produced by the Draco Group's own vineyard. Its annual production was extremely limited, reserved only for the Draco Group's high-ranking members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the elite of the elite, or members of ancient families, would be hard-pressed to taste it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the price was steep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Six million dollars a bottle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was shocked before checking the second most expensive option.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Systin, a wine produced by the ancient Systin family, renowned for their winemaking expertise. For over a thousand years, six out of the top ten winemakers on this planet had hailed from the Systin family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Systin wine was highly coveted, a luxury only nobles could afford.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the Systin family had perished in a disaster decades ago, and the remaining bottles of Systin wine had become exceedingly rare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even top auction houses had struggled to find them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Black market prices soared into the tens of millions without any seller showing up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the mall, a bottle of Systin was priced at 10 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head and turned to the most expensive wine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The price took his breath away - 50 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had a peculiar name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Noble Blue!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No description? Just a name? What makes it worth fifty million?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget it. You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs! I'm going all in to pass this test!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a determined grimace, Osborne placed his order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bought a bottle of Noble Blue, two bottles of Systin, and five bottles of Glacium Beauty, spending a total of 100 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, the wines were delivered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stashed the wine in the trunk before driving over to the Radcliffe Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, Clarissa had finished breakfast and was taking a leisurely stroll through the estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna, Barlyn, and Bodyguard Unit Four were hanging out not too far off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bro, I'm over here!" Barlyn called out, spotting Osborne from a distance and waving enthusiastically, his face lit up with a wide grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surprise was palpable among Sharon and the members of Bodyguard Unit Four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged puzzled looks, wondering, "Why is the new head of security so chummy with Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's going on here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa and Donna also glanced over at Barlyn, their faces reflecting their shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barlyn, what did you just call him?" Donna asked, furrowing her brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn shrugged casually. "What's the big deal? Osborne and I go way back. We're brothers through thick and thin. He's a year older than me, so I call him 'bro'. Is that so strange?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Brothers through thick and thin?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn's been in Mayby City for barely a day. What on earth did Osborne do to make Barlyn behave like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My son might seem like a playboy on the surface, but he's really quite proud and selective.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's rare for him to take a liking to anyone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa, equally stunned, kept shifting her gaze between Barlyn and Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne greeted Clarissa and Donna with a warm smile before heading over to Barlyn's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn leaned in and said quietly, "Let's go, Osborne. Time for more drinks!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up with interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, "I was just figuring out how to get Barlyn to hit the bottle with me. Since you've come to me first, I can't be blamed here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next up, I'll let you experience a bit of the harsh realities of society!"</span></p></div>
