        <h1>Chapter 330 All Burned</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No. Bryce is really my brother! I'm his sister, Kendra Clarkson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She screamed in fear, but unfortunately, Xavier didn't care at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he tore her clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As more and more parts of her body were suddenly exposed in air, Xavier couldn't help but breathe rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's so pretty!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier murmured. Through his life as a pirate, he had captured countless women and raped even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Never had he seen or touched such a stunner so far.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both her appearance and figure were perfect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bitch, stop struggling! I'll fuck you today anyway, even if Bryce comes to kill me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his rapid and unsteady breath, Xavier was about to push her down and pounce onto her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, everyone around felt that the air suddenly became penetrating, and the temperature in the entire space seemed to drop by ten or twenty degrees at once, as if winter had come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, they all heard a voice that seemed to come from the abyss of hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are indeed going to die before you can put your filthy hands on her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, Xavier suddenly stiffened, turning his head in horror to look in the direction of the cave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tall and robust young man appeared there without knowing when.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was extremely handsome but seemed to be in an extremely bad mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After killing the three pirates guarding the gate, Osborne rushed into the depths of the cave without alerting anyone and came to this huge fortification.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he witnessed the whole process of Xavier ripping off that gorgeous woman's clothes in an attempt to rape her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was also extremely surprised about her beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was like a goddess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to his so-called biological sister Yulissa, Kendra was as attractive as her. Among the women Osborne knew, only Clarissa and Isa could surpass her beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "How could such a beautiful woman be abducted by pirates?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And according to her, her name was Kendra?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His brother was Bryce?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before sailing, he had heard of Bryce from Brian that Bryce was the leader of the biggest pirate gang of the southern Rosmandi, Likreia Mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all called him Madman!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian reminded Osborne that if he encountered pirates from Likreia Mountain at sea, he needed to try every means to avoid conflicts with them. As long as he offered tributes to them, the pirates from Likreia Mountain would not slaughter him or his crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other hand, if the pirates from Likreia Mountain felt offended, Osborne would have to give up sailing from now on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, Bryce's gang was considered the overlords of the sea area south of Rosmandi. The naval fleets of several surrounding countries had encircled and suppressed them several times, but they all ended in failure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, no one dared to interfere with their business anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce also became the overlord of this sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could this delicate woman be Bryce's sister?" Osborne didn't think so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Bryce to be able to achieve such an achievement, his strength must be extremely powerful. At least he must be a master; otherwise, he would have been eliminated long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could his sister be so weak?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the overlord of this sea area, how could his sister be kidnapped by a small pirate so easily?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, no matter who she was, Osborne would save her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Xavier and said coldly, "You scum. Go to hell! Now, atone for your sins in pain!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, he waved his hand violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a fierce wind surged up like a tornado, instantly blowing more than 20 pirates and Xavier away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were trapped in the air and screamed in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Flame!" Osborne snorted coldly, and suddenly, the fire wave began to burn fiercely under their feet, instantly igniting their clothes and burning their skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Flame!" As he shouted loudly, the flames became more intense and scorching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The screams of the group of pirates became </span><span>more shrill</span><span>. Their skin had been burnt, and all their hair had vanished on fire. The intense pain made them struggle frantically, but they still couldn't escape from the roaring flame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Xavier was a Class C+ metahuman, he had no hope of winning Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the aroma of the burned human flesh spread throughout the closed underground fortification. Except for Xavier, who was still struggling, all the other pirates were almost burned into charcoal. Their bodies curled up in agony, and they ended up very miserably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, although they felt relieved to see the pirates oppress them dying like this, the women who were chained could not help vomiting when they saw such a cruel scene and smelled the aroma of barbecue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were vomiting so madly that they even started vomiting bile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only that gorgeous woman named Kendra acted like nothing had happened. Instead, she was excited and fanatical to see Xavier being burned with hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a stern face, Osborne ordered the flames to break out violently, engulfing all the pirates except Xavier, and instantly burning them to ashes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was not even a corpse left!</span></p></div>
