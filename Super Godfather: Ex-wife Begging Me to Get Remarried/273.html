        <h1>Chapter 273 The Dreadful Medusa</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and Clarissa were both utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa quickly helped Donna to her feet, her expression full of concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt Donna, are you alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna moved her lips as if to say something, but she had no strength to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa clenched her teeth and waved her hand forcefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, a white Holy Light fell like nectar upon Donna, being absorbed by her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Donna's pale complexion returned to normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body regained its strength. The Holy Light dissolved the toxins within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa didn't stop there. She continued to channel the Holy Light, enveloping the eight bodyguards she had brought, dissolving the toxins in their bodies and restoring their mobility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne, who hadn't been affected by the poison, was nourished by the Holy Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was grave as he said, "Clarissa, conserve your energy! Our enemies this time are likely to be incredibly powerful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood firmly in front of Clarissa, his eyes fixed on the corridor, his gaze icy cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come out already, if you dare! We're leaving if you don't show yourselves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne spoke, the surroundings remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, the sound of faint footsteps could be heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a cold voice rang out. "You are indeed the </span><span>Fatebearer</span><span>! We underestimated you. Even Venom Lord's poison did not affect you. You can even detoxify others from my toxin!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pity, you will still die today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a tall dark figure appeared in the corridor. He wore a black hat that covered most of his face, but the part that was exposed was covered in disgusting pits as if splashed by concentrated sulfuric acid, extremely grotesque and terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Venom Lord?" Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man had revealed himself as Venom Lord, clearly a master of poisons or a metahuman!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His power was likely a bizarre method of using poison. Only thus could he have knocked out everyone in the castle in such a short time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Donna, a Class C+ metahuman, couldn't withstand it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The large-scale toxin released by Venom Lord had even Donna caught off guard. This indicated that Venom Lord's strength far exceeded Donna's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was likely a Class B or even a Class B+ metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was grave, but not because of Venom Lord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were fixed on the person behind Venom Lord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a woman, a young and beautiful woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her petite figure was completely blocked by the towering Venom Lord, so no one noticed her. Only Osborne felt the pressure emanating from her was far more terrifying than Venom Lord's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And who might you be?!" Osborne said coldly, quietly pressing a button on his Draco Star Wristlet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman finally stepped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked strange, with her eyes closed, a confident smile on her face, facing Osborne and Clarissa, her face full of amazement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I must thank you for allowing me to watch such an exciting farce. If I didn't have a mission, I really wouldn't want to disturb you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, let me introduce myself. You can call me Medusa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Medusa?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned. Medusa was the mythical Gorgon with snakes for hair, having two sisters who were demons. She was the only mortal among them, but that didn't mean Medusa was not powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to legend, Medusa had a pair of terrifying eyes; anyone who looked into her eyes would be instantly petrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, this woman could not be the Medusa from the myth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa was just her code name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the fact that she used such a code name indicated that her abilities were likely similar to those of the mythical Medusa. Considering her strange closed eyes, Osborne was even more vigilant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch out for her eyes. Don't look directly at her!" Osborne said quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was already too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa suddenly opened her eyes and looked in the direction of the eight bodyguards. They hadn't even realized what was happening when their bodies suddenly stiffened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, their bodies quickly grew a stone skin, completely wrapping them up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a few seconds, they were petrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Osborne was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this time, Medusa's eyes had already turned to Donna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Osborne's reminder and the eight bodyguards as a warning, Donna reacted quickly and immediately turned her head to avoid looking directly at Medusa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But unfortunately, her body was still stiff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Layers of stone skin quickly appeared. Donna tried to resist the petrification desperately, but it was useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Similarly, in just a few seconds, Donna was petrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This situation made Osborne extremely shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not looking directly into her eyes can also be petrified? What kind of power is this? She is even more terrifying than the mythical Medusa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sense of crisis in Osborne's heart reached its peak at this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And just at this moment, Medusa's beautiful eyes finally turned to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne felt a strange force entering his body, and his body became stiff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Layers of stone skin appeared on the surface of his body, tightly wrapping him.</span></p></div>
