        <h1>Chapter 77 Joining the Radcliffe Family</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne looked at Isa speechlessly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Isa killed Milo. Why could they blame it on him? He was really wronged. There was no place to appeal for justice. Milo came here to assassinate Osborne. But now he was dead. If Osborne didn&rsquo;t take the blame, who would?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry too much. This is also a test for you. You are Godfather&rsquo;s prospective successor. When he was young, he was able to defeat the Aberrants. As his successor, why can&rsquo;t you do the same? Besides, I will help you too.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Isa patted Osborne&rsquo;s shoulder to comfort him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne said unhappily, &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne didn&rsquo;t want to waste any more time. He was ready to go to the Radcliffe family. No matter how powerful the Aberrants was or whether they would retaliate against him, the most important thing for him now was to complete the third test.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Only by completing more tests could Osborne get more rewards and gain more wealth and power.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">By then, he would be more confident in dealing with the Aberrants.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Let me tell you another piece of news. It&rsquo;s about Clarissa,&rdquo; Isa suddenly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne stopped and asked curiously, &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Isa came over and whispered in his ear, &ldquo;In fact, the one who attacked Clarissa was also from the Aberrants. Clarissa has been targeted by them. Even if I didn&rsquo;t kill Milo, as long as you are Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguard, you will definitely face the Aberrants.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was suddenly shocked. &ldquo;Why did they target Clarissa?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Isa shrugged. &ldquo;How should I know? Maybe someone hired the Aberrants to kill her, or maybe she is the target of the Aberrants. If it&rsquo;s the former, Clarissa still has a chance to survive. If it&rsquo;s the latter, that pretty girl probably won&rsquo;t live long.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne frowned tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">My third test as the successor is to become the captain of Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguards</span><span style="font-style: italic;">,</span> he thought. <span style="font-style: italic;">If Clarissa is assassinated by the </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Aberrants</span><span style="font-style: italic;">, my test will fail. Therefore, I must protect Clarissa, even if it means provoking the </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Aberrants</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Thank you for the information. I will be careful.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne didn&rsquo;t say anything more. After saying goodbye to Isa, he drove to the Radcliffe Manor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Today was the day he officially became Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When they arrived at the Radcliffe Manor, someone led him in and took him to a row of two-story buildings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This was the base of the bodyguards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The four people who were admitted with him yesterday have all arrived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">There were three men and one woman. Osborne remembered their names.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The woman&rsquo;s name was Sherry. The men&rsquo;s names were Hunter, Oliver, and Brandon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing Osborne, the four of them came up to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Hunter smiled and said, &ldquo;Osborne, your performance yesterday was really amazing. Your ability is top-notch even in Skyefall Security Services.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Hunter won the second place yesterday. He admired Osborne&rsquo;s strength in marksmanship and fighting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne said with a smile, &ldquo;You are not bad. We can cooperate more in the future.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;We are not good as you. We can only become Ms. Radcliffe inner bodyguard. But you have a chance to become Ms. Radcliffe&rsquo;s personal bodyguard.&rdquo; After Hunter finished speaking, the other three nodded in agreement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Personal bodyguards? That&rsquo;s ridiculous.&rdquo; Suddenly, a contemptuous laughter came.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, a strong and arrogant figure walked in with long strides.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguard captain, Paul.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul stared at Osborne coldly and snorted. He looked contemptuous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Let me introduce myself. My name is Paul. I&rsquo;m the captain of Ms. Radcliffe&rsquo;s bodyguards. All of you will be my subordinates from now on. I will be in charge of assigning your tasks. Now, why don&rsquo;t you bow to me?&rdquo; Paul raised his neck slightly and said proudly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Hunter and the other three looked at each other. Finally, they bowed slightly and saluted Paul.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne didn&rsquo;t move. He looked at Paul coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had no good feelings toward Paul, not to mention that Osborne&rsquo;s test as successor was to replace Paul and become the captain of Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguards. They would have a falling out sooner or later. How could he bow to Paul?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul pulled a long face when he saw Osborne didn&rsquo;t move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He said coldly, &ldquo;Are you going to disobey me on your first day at work? Don&rsquo;t you respect me as your leader?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne also said coldly, &ldquo;Captain Paul, don&rsquo;t act so arrogantly here. Although you are the captain of the bodyguards, you are not my employer. I am only responsible to my employer.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul sneered, &ldquo;So, you are not convinced by my leadership?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne shrugged. &ldquo;If you want to understand it this way, it&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul&rsquo;s expression became even colder. Everyone could feel that the air around them seemed to be cooling down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The two men stared at each other. The atmosphere was tense. It seemed that a fight would break out at any time.</p></div>
