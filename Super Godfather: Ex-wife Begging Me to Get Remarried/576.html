        <h1>Chapter 576 Death Sickle</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's icy words sent a ripple of shock through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected him to be so blunt, so fearlessly direct.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers stared in disbelief, and even Larry and the elite fighters from Ransford were momentarily stunned by his audacity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't take long for their surprise to turn into fury. Ransford's fighters glared at Osborne, their eyes blazing with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the people from Dampston felt a surge of pride. Watching Osborne standing there, unyielding and bold, filled them with a renewed sense of hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His defiant words had lifted a weight from their hearts, a weight they had carried for far too long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For years, Dampston had been seen as the weakest among the nine Augustine family branches, dismissed and looked down upon by everyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had never been able to fight back because, frankly, they lacked the strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, they had Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this moment, they felt that as long as Osborne stood with them, no one had the right to look down on them anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're walking right into your grave, Osborne!" Larry snarled and his voice thick with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't even flinch. "You've got five minutes. Get out of the Third Estate, or I'll make you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five minutes? Don't waste my time," Larry shot back, his anger boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're so eager to fight, let's do it now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>" You killed David. Let's finish this once and for all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smirk played at the corner of Osborne's mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine by me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved his hand, signaling the Dampston members to step back a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In response, Larry gestured for his fighters to advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearly thirty of them stepped forward, each exuding a powerful aura. Most of them had competed in Branch Bloodline Competition the day before, and they were all at Class A or above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leading them were the three elders of Ransford, including Larry, all of whom were at Class AA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked at Osborne with a mixture of contempt and confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This looked like a completely lopsided battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was alone, facing nearly thirty seasoned fighters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his victory over Sam during the tournament, almost no one believed he could stand against the combined might of Ransford.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne's icy words hung in the air, the atmosphere grew so tense it felt like the world had paused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a burst of energy, his martial art aura flared up, encasing him in a brilliant, protective light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze zeroed in on the three elders leading Ransford, Larry and his two companions, all seasoned fighters at Class AA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their expressions were calm, almost bored, as if they couldn't imagine Osborne posing any real threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne wasn't one to take chances. He knew that if he wanted to win, these three had to fall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd been preparing for this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne reached into Dimensional Space and pulled out a massive, jet-black sickle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Towering above even his tall frame, the sickle was nearly twice his height, its grotesque, fearsome design immediately capturing everyone's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sinister energy pulsed from the blade, chilling the air around it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, Larry's confidence wavered. He frowned, his earlier arrogance beginning to crack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's lips curled into a cold smile as he gripped Death Sickle tightly, his eyes never leaving the three elders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's settle this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he swung the sickle in a wide, deadly arc toward them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The very fabric of reality seemed to distort as the blade moved, sending an invisible, malevolent force surging toward the three elders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They sensed the danger, but it was too late to dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperation etched across their faces as they hastily unleashed their energy shields.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was no use. The sickle's power bypassed their defenses entirely, cutting straight to their souls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their screams echoed through the air as agony twisted their faces. The soul-searing pain from the sickle's attack left them trembling, their very spirits quivering under the assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's power had grown exponentially since he absorbed star power, making him an even more formidable force when wielding Death Sickle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Death sickle was powered by the wielder's soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stronger the soul, the more devastating the sickle's impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Osborne's hands, it was more powerful than it had ever been under its previous master, Chris.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Chris had needed time to recover after each use of the sickle, Osborne was now strong enough to wield it in rapid succession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His ability to continually draw on the star power made him the perfect wielder of this deadly weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without missing a beat, Osborne raised the sickle again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was cold and unyielding. "If you won't leave on your own, then I'll make sure you do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With another swing, the sickle's soul-rending energy slashed through the three elders once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was an attack they couldn't hope to resist. The only way to resist its devastating attacks was through formidable spiritual and mental fortitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Serena, who was stronger than them, had struggled to survive three hits from Chris' sickle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But these three weren't nearly as strong, and Osborne was far deadlier than Chris had ever been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The outcome was clear. Larry and the others were at their breaking point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their screams became more frantic, their faces turning ghostly pale as their defenses shattered. Their bodies shook uncontrollably, barely able to remain upright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And then, with a final, despairing cry, Larry collapsed to his knees.</span></p></div>
