        <h1>Chapter 423 Return to Alisa Ship</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Class A, Class A+, Class AA, Class AAA, and then Class S Supreme Overlord."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought that Class A was the end. After all, Class A could be considered a master in the entire world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it turned out that there were so many levels above Class A.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's arrogance disappeared at this moment. Serena was very powerful, and Osborne felt that even if ten men like him fought Serena together, they would lose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Serena was only Class AA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce was Class AAA, more powerful than Serena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were also Class S like the King of Aberrants and Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt that he had a new goal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to become Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to become the Supreme Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His power was only at Class B+ now. In Serena's words, he hadn't even started on the path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this didn't affect Osborne's determination that he must become Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to become a real big shot like the King of Aberrants and Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, you don't have to think too much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena patted Osborne on the shoulder and said, "You have done well enough. At your age, there are not many people better than you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled bitterly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was this a comfort for him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Serena with depression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena couldn't help but laugh. "Don't think I'm discouraging you. I'm very satisfied with your growth. Do you know how long have you been in this circle?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It has been less than two months since Godfather found you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In just two months, you have already broken through to Class A. This speed is not unique, but it is rare. Most of those who are stronger than you have spent much longer than you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, as long as you can survive, I believe that one day you will be able to catch up with them or even surpass them. You may even be able to do what your father has not done and become a qualified Godfather."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena said these words with a serious look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne also looked serious. "Ms. Hernandez, thank you for your encouragement. I will work hard. I don't want to become the new Godfather. I just want to protect the people I care about and save Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have to become stronger, so I will work hard. I will kill anyone who dares to stand in my way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if he is the king of the Aberrants, I will kill."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes were full of murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena opened her mouth with shock, but soon, she showed satisfaction and joy on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's good that you have such an idea. Godfather and I are not wrong about you. I believe you can do it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I also believe that Godfather can't wait to meet you in person. Hurry up and complete your fifth test of succession. Time is running out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Serena finished speaking, she stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, my injury is healed now. We should go up the ship."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the two returned to the Alisa Ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attack of the Aberrants had retreated. Because of Osborne's timely response, the tourists on the ship were all fine. They just felt that the wind and waves tonight were particularly huge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the stolen jewelry had been recovered and nothing was lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the man in black, Isaac injured him, but he escaped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, the storm was finally over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne even saw that in the distance, two ships with the Likreia Mountain logo appeared as if they were protecting the ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was grateful to Bryce in his heart. He put away the skinmask and returned to his suite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan, Nathan, Kaden, Yulissa, and Queenie were all here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Osborne coming back, they all hurried to greet him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, where have you been just now? Something happened to the ship. The pirates were very powerful and wanted to steal our jewels. Fortunately, Isaac injured the pirates and took back all the jewels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We couldn't find you and were so worried about you. Why do you look so pale? Are you injured?" Yulissa asked worriedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled. Yulissa had no idea what had just happened. The pirates robbing jewels was just a cover to attract attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The real attack came from many Class A members of the Aberrants, and even two Class AA members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even Isaac didn't know this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was not going to tell Yulissa. He smiled and said, "I'm fine. I just wanted to help Isaac, but I was shaken by the aftermath of the battle and suffered a minor injury."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she pouted and complained, "You are such a fool. That was a battle between Class A masters. Why did you interfere? Fortunately, you are fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said nothing more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at a person in the suite with cold eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He must be the traitor in the Augustine family.</span></p></div>
