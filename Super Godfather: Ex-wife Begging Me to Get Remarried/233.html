        <h1>Chapter 233 Announce Our Relationship</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Clarissa, whose expression was serious and determined, and he felt a resolve settle within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded in agreement. "Alright, I'm with you on this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But we can't just announce it casually. We need the right moment, a grand occasion </span><span>where all the big shots from </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> will be present."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne believed that this was the fastest way to gain recognition and complete the trial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa considered this for a moment, her brow furrowing in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, her eyes lit up. "Osborne, in three days, there's going to be a lavish wedding in </span><span>Mayby</span><span> City! The Ashford family and the Caldwell family are tying the knot, and I've received an invitation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why don't we announce our relationship at that wedding?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne froze for a second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You mean Ophelia and Wesley's wedding?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! That's the one! Did they invite you too? I remember you know them, although your relationship might be a bit rocky."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was momentarily taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rocky? That was an understatement. Ophelia was his ex-wife, and their past was anything but smooth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only a handful of people knew about their history, and that included the Caldwell family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Clarissa, he felt a weight on his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, there's something I've been meaning to tell you, something I haven't been honest about. After you hear this, you can decide whether you still want to announce our relationship."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She </span><span>blinked,</span><span> curiosity piqued. "What is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Osborne steadied himself and said, "I've been married before. Three years ago, I tied the knot, and just before I met you, I got divorced. My ex-wife is Ophelia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the words left his lips, Osborne felt a surprising sense of relief wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He studied Clarissa's face, unsure how she would react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, who would want a boyfriend with a divorce under his belt?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his astonishment, Clarissa broke into a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you finally said it! I've known for a while, you know. Aunt Donna did some digging and told me everything, even about how you were mistreated during those three years with the Caldwell family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please don't be mad at me for keeping it to myself. I didn't want you to feel inferior or think you weren't good enough for me, so I pretended not to know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that you've told me, I'm genuinely happy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want you to know that I don't care about your past. What matters to me is you&mdash;who you are today. Let's leave the past behind and focus on our future together, alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She squeezed his hand tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a jolt of emotion at her words. Clarissa had known all along about his marriage and Ophelia, yet she chose to act obliviously for his sake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her intention to announce their relationship at Ophelia's wedding was likely a way for her to stand by him and help him reclaim his dignity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he felt overwhelmed with gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled her into a warm embrace. "Clarissa, I can't express how lucky I feel to have you in my life. Let's make our announcement at Ophelia and Wesley's wedding!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa beamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely! Just three days away! I can hardly wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shared her excitement, feeling a flutter of anticipation in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the rest of the day, they delved into studying the Fate Staff, but their efforts yielded little progress. Clarissa sensed a connection to the staff, yet she couldn't tap into its power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think it might be because my power level is still too low," Clarissa said, biting her lip in concentration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Class B+ is too low? You're already stronger than I am!" Osborne exclaimed, genuinely impressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa smiled, "Oh, come on! In my eyes, you'll always be the strongest. I'm just your little sidekick, here to support you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her playful tone lightened the mood. Osborne gently patted Clarissa on the head, deeply moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "What a wonderful woman she is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa put away her Fate Staff, deciding to wait until she advanced to Class A power master before trying again. The power of the statue had already entered her body, but she had only absorbed a small fraction of it. She could feel that Class B+ was far from her limit; Clarissa would soon break through to Class A and become a power master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at her with great envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still hadn't figured out how to consolidate the soul of powers to advance to Class B.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, take your time with your research. I have some things to prepare and might not be around tomorrow," Osborne said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's expression hardened abruptly. She grabbed Osborne's arm with a sense of urgency. "Osborne, you're going to the Chevalier family's diamond mine, aren't you? I have a feeling they won't just hand over a ten-billion-dollar diamond mine without some sort of scheme behind it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was etched with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled gently, "I know there's a scheme, but I have to go. We're talking about ten billion dollars here&mdash;it's rightfully mine, so I have to get it back. Don't worry, I'm confident everything will be fine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And besides, I'm planning to marry you someday, so I need to make a lot of money!"</span></p></div>
