        <h1>Chapter 1506 Cripple Them All</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young Keynes family members were frozen in place, their eyes wide in disbelief as they watched Osborne shatter Kerwin's divine power essence with a single kick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kerwin's body deflated like a punctured balloon, his divine power gushing out uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shock quickly gave way to rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You filthy Human Community scum, how dare you cripple Uncle Kerwin's divine power essence? You've made him a useless husk! You're digging your own grave!" they roared, divine power surging from their bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked coldly. "So, you want to throw down too? Think carefully. How do you stack up against your Uncle Kerwin? If you want to end up just like him, be my guest. I won't hold back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words were like a bucket of ice water, dousing their flames of fury. They stiffened, fear gripping them, and they dared not move an inch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, they were mere fledgling Celestial Deities, impressive in their own right among the younger generation but lightyears behind veterans like Kerwin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And if a seasoned warrior like Kerwin was felled in two moves, what chance did they have?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had shown no mercy to Kerwin&mdash;would their lineage matter to him at all?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic seized them, their faces turning ashen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them clenched his teeth, trying to rally his comrades. "Don't be scared of him! He only won because Uncle Kerwin got careless. If Uncle Kerwin hadn't underestimated this guy, he wouldn't have lost. We've got three of us&mdash;team up, and we can take him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words stirred hesitation in the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They remembered how swiftly Kerwin had fallen, a victim of his own oversight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged rapid glances and telepathic whispers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Should we make a move?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we leave now, what will that say about the Keynes family? We can't let this lowlife get away with it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have to avenge Uncle Kerwin!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's just bluffing! If he really had the power, why would he let us walk away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's do it! Now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Decision made, they launched themselves at Osborne from three directions, divine power blazing without restraint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You filthy human, die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You crippled Uncle Kerwin&mdash;we're here to avenge him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air crackled with their combined might as their attacks hurtled toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression remained disdainful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't want to bother with you, thought it'd be no fun. But if you insist on dying, who am I to deny you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a casual flick of his hand, Osborne summoned a tempest of thunder and lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thunderform Flash&mdash;not only enhancing his speed but also acting as a formidable defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young warriors' attacks crashed into the lightning barrier, but Osborne stood firm, unmoved by their futile assaults.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces drained of color. "What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their combined might couldn't even scratch his defense!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How were they supposed to fight this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realization hit like a hammer&mdash;they'd underestimated Osborne. They turned tail, using every ounce of speed to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted disdainfully. "Think you can run?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I warned you&mdash;try to fight, and you'll end up just like your Uncle Kerwin, permanently crippled!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, Osborne's speed surged to the absolute limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Crimson Ironhoof Clan youths were fast, but they were no match for Osborne in his Thunderform Flash mode. In the blink of an eye, Osborne caught up to one of the young men, his palm crackling with electric energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a brutal strike, he slammed his fist into the youth's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact was immediate. The young man sprayed blood, half his body charred to cinders by the devastating lightning, his divine power spilling out uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had shattered his divine power essence just as ruthlessly as he had Kerwin's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne spared the fallen youth barely a glance before zipping off to intercept the second youth, reducing him to a smoldering ruin with a single punch, his divine power essence shattering like glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the third youth had managed to put some distance between himself and Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as he thought he might escape, three figures blocked his path&mdash;Betty, Thera, and Sophia, all Celestial Deities of the same caliber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their combined talents and strength were no less formidable than the Crimson Ironhoof Clan youths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The third youth tried to flee, but with the three sisters closing in, his speed advantage became meaningless under their concerted attack. Soon, he was battered and bruised, collapsing to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne arrived just in time, his expression cold as he shattered the youth's divine power essence with a single kick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The youth's pained shriek pierced the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's voice boomed. "Get lost! Go back and tell your elders in the Keynes family to stay out of my way and keep their distance from Spark of Blaze. Next time, I won't just cripple you&mdash;I'll kill."</span></p></div>
