        <h1>Chapter 1476 Mysterious Girl</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was on high alert, ready for anything, as he pushed the door open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to his surprise, there was no immediate danger. Instead, he found a girl sitting calmly in a chair, watching him intently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was stunning, dressed in elegant attire that made it clear she was no ordinary slave. There were no chains binding her, and she didn't seem to belong in a cage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most striking of all was the fact that Osborne couldn't gauge her strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could sense she was formidable, her eyes sparkling with intelligence, as if she could see right through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, she bore no Divine Flame above her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While others might have been taken aback by such a sight, Osborne remained composed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Eclipsing Mantra could conceal a Divine Flame, and he was sure there were other techniques that could do the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This girl had clearly mastered some kind of secret art similar to the Eclipsing Mantra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He studied her, astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, this is the hybrid slave I bought for 30 million Essence Crystals?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She looks like a perfectly normal member of the Human Community, and she certainly doesn't resemble a slave&mdash;more like a guest of honor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne took in the girl's features, she was equally assessing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze was sharp and curious, filled with a kind of wisdom that intrigued him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, she spoke, her voice melodic and light, like birdsong, "So, you're the one who spent 30 million low-grade Essence Crystals to buy me? Now that you've seen me, are you disappointed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied casually, "I did buy you, but you hardly seem like someone who needs to be bought. You don't belong on a shelf like some piece of merchandise. I'm guessing you're more like a VIP here. Did you ask to be sold?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just can't wrap my head around why you'd want to do that. But hey, I'll chalk it up to a joke. Since you clearly don't plan on leaving with me, how about returning those 30 million Essence Crystals?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, the girl paused, taken aback for a moment before she laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why do you think I wouldn't want to go with you? Do you think I'm a bad investment? And by the way, once you buy something at the slave market, there's no backing out! I won't be giving you back those Essence Crystals because I'm coming with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne blinked in surprise. "You're serious?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nodded, her expression earnest. "I've decided to stay with you for a while. There are things I'm curious about, and I want to figure them out. Once I do, I'll decide whether to stay longer or leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned. "It seems you didn't really ask for my permission."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was an air of undeniable confidence about her, as if she believed her decision was final and that he wouldn't dare refuse her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This led him to suspect that her background was quite extraordinary, which only reinforced his belief that she was indeed a VIP in this auction&mdash;a mere farce to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ask for permission?" she mused softly, then added with a hint of apology, "I suppose I should have."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, let me ask you now: may I stay with you for a while? Don't worry; I won't cause any trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne maintained his calm demeanor. "Alright, but tell me, why do you want to stay with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl didn't hesitate for a second. "Because you're special!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today at the slave market, you spent a staggering 120 million low-grade Essence Crystals to buy every human slave up for auction."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you didn't do it to enslave them, to use them for your own amusement, or to torment them. Instead, you immediately freed them, restoring their identities and even telling them they could walk away if they wanted."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's not something a normal person would do! I bet everyone, including those you bought, thinks you've lost your marbles."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's why I find you intriguing. I want to know why you did it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow at her words. "So, you think I'm crazy too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without missing a beat, she nodded. "I won't lie to you; I do think that, at least until I figure out your true intentions. I can't rule it out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but grin at her honesty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, if you want to think I'm nuts, go ahead! But I'm going to have to decline your request to stick around. You're just too mysterious for my liking, and having you close makes me uneasy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, keep the 30 million; it's yours to do with as you please, just as long as you don't follow me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne turned on his heel and headed for the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl was momentarily taken aback, watching him stride away without a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She frowned, clearly puzzled. "Aren't you even a little curious about who I am?"</span></p></div>
