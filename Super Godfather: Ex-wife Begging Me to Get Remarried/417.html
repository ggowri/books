        <h1>Chapter 417 Death Sickle</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Hernandez, I didn't expect that you still remembered me. I am flattered."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked to Bruce's side, and the huge black sickle in his hand was almost twice as tall as his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy fluctuations on the black sickle were strange. There were traces of black light flashing, which made people feel uncomfortable just by looking at it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Osborne, who was not far away, was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This middle-aged man was powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to Serena's expression, Osborne could tell that this man named Chris was a disciple of the King of the Aberrants, and his strength was at the same level as Serena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, Serena wouldn't look so solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was Chris' code name Soul Reaper?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena sneered, "Your action this time is not to disrupt the auction, but just to kill me. Even you are here. It seems that you are determined to win."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris smiled, "Ms. Hernandez, you are one of the eight maids of Godfather. Compared with you, an auction is nothing. To deal with you, we should be well-prepared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, as long as I can kill you, Godfather's strength will be weakened. He will lose control of Skyefall and Dampston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Killing you is important to us, so I came here myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruce said, "Chris, don't waste time talking to her. Kill her now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Hernandez, I'm sorry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, he swung the huge black sickle in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strange wave instantly spread toward Serena, and she suddenly put the sword in front of herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her sword made a loud clanging sound and was shaking violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena's face turned pale. She suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood, and her expression became much weaker as if her energy had been cut off by Chris' black sickle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this scene, Bruce looked excited. "Serena, do you still want to struggle? You don't have any chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris smiled and said, "Ms. Hernandez, please surrender. My Death Sickle is a replica of the sickle of Death in mythology. Although it is not the real sickle of Death, it is a rare ancient magic weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With my power, every time I swing the Death Sickle, I can get a part of your spirit and soul. You will become weaker and weaker until all your souls are reaped by me and become supplements for the Death Sickle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You won't win."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena's face was pale. She coughed twice and coughed up blood again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was no fear in her eyes. She sneered and said, "You want me to surrender? Impossible. You have grown to this level. There are not many people in this world who can stand your attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it's not that easy to kill me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before you reap my soul, I will cut your neck first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Serena's sword flew out. It turned into a terrifying sword light and went straight for Chris' neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sneer on his face, Chris looked calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruce's cane appeared in front of Chris, blocking Serena's sword light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sword light was blocked, but it didn't stop and continued to attack madly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, Serena was anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she couldn't break through Bruce's defense quickly. All the sword lights she attacked Chris were blocked by Bruce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking advantage of this time, Chris swung the Death Sickle at Serena again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Serena covered her head and let out a scream, the sword light stopped instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris smiled, "Ms. Hernandez, do you want to cut off my neck? With Mr. Turner here, you can't do that. But how many times can you block my attack? Five times or six times?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruce said contemptuously, "Serena, you are just struggling. I admit that you are stronger than me. Whether it is me or Chris, if we meet you alone, we will most likely lose to you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But unfortunately, you have no chance if we two join forces. I can't beat you, but I can block your attacks and prevent you from hurting Chris."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena's face turned even paler at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sneered, "Even if I die here, I won't let you go easily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the sword light shot out again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was blocked by Bruce. Although more wounds were on Bruce's body, he was not in danger of life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking a rest, Chris once again raised the Death Sickle in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Hernandez.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With this sickle, I will cut your spirit and soul in half. By then, even if you can still fight, you will no longer be a match for Mr. Turner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, let's end the battle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Chris swung the Death Sickle towards Serena.</span></p></div>
