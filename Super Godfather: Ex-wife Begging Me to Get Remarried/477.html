        <h1>Chapter 477 Can I Use My Mouth?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what happened to me just now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa looked a bit bewildered. Just when it was crucial, she suddenly fainted. Upon waking up, she realized that she was lying naked on the bed, and her face instantly turned red with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa glanced at the bed sheet and found it was clean and without any blood, then she was immediately disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that nothing like that happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a little disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Naturally, Osborne couldn't tell her that it was Isa who had made her faint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked over and gently held her, explaining, "Clarissa, there was a little accident just now. The fate power in your body leaked out, causing you to faint. I've realized that the fate power within you is much stronger than I had thought before, so we may not be able to do those things yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She exclaimed, "How could this happen? Then we, we..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's neck turned red, and she felt extremely shy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "Don't worry. The current situation is simply because my physical condition is not strong enough to withstand the impact of the fate power within you. Once my strength increases a bit more, there won't be any issues."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished speaking, Clarissa breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She whispered, "Well, how long will that take?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled and said, "That depends on how hard we work! Anyway, as our realm reaches Class AAA, it will be fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Should we all reach Class AAA?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was shocked and didn't even know that there were other realms after Class A.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly explained to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finishing figuring it out, Clarissa bit her lips, looking a little melancholy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I'm not even at Class A yet. How long will it take me to reach Class AAA? I won't have to wait until I'm old to reach it, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was some fear in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly comforted her. "No, you are the </span><span>Fatebearer</span><span>, so you have the fate power in your body, which will make your cultivation much faster than others."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But, but what if? Then wouldn't we be unable to do that forever?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa looked at Osborne with an apologetic expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, Osborne. I can't have sex with you, so I may not be a qualified wife."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, tears filled her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was startled and quickly hugged her. "Clarissa, don't think too much. It's just </span><span>that we can't do that kind of thing for the time being, so it's no big deal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa bit her lip. If they couldn't do that kind of thing, what kind of couple were they? Why did she ask him to be with her, but he could only endure it and not do that kind of thing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, she felt extremely guilty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa bit her lip and said, "Osborne, I will definitely practice very hard! I will strive to break through to Class AAA as soon as possible. Just wait for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded and said with a smile, "Okay, I'll wait for you! Let's work hard together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finishing saying that, Osborne gently patted her on the back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holding a great beauty like Clarissa in his arms but not being able to do anything indeed made him have a tormenting feeling. But for the sake of both him and her, he could only endure it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just a physical reaction that he couldn't control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Clarissa felt the changes in Osborne's body. Her pretty face became redder, and even her neck turned red, but her expression seemed to be conflicted and struggling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, she suddenly became determined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa raised her head, looked into his eyes, and said shyly, "Osborne, as long as you don't do that kind of thing, everything else will be fine, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned but nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to Isa, as long as he didn't enter her body, Clarissa's fate power would not leak out into his body on a large scale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Clarissa saw him nod, her pretty face turned even redder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said with a trembling voice, "Then, can I help you? Can I use my mouth?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saying that, Clarissa shyly buried her head in Osborne's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned as he heard this and looked at her in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is </span><span>this</span><span> okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa bit her lip and nodded forcefully. "I, I can do it! Osborne, I am willing to do anything for you. </span><span>But,</span><span> I am not experienced with it, so if you feel uncomfortable, please don't blame me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swallowed his saliva and instantly felt his body getting hot, and his body's reaction became more intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa felt it, and her pretty face turned red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't hesitate any longer and leaned down abruptly. With trembling hands, Clarissa grasped Osborne's penis. Then, her rosy lips slowly drew closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, his body suddenly straightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a breath and held her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa took Osborne's penis into her mouth and suddenly felt filled up, even breathing was a little difficult. But feeling his intense reaction, she seemed to be encouraged. Then, she closed her eyes and worked harder to serve Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, her movements were incredibly awkward, with her teeth frequently grazing against Osborne's penis. He could sense her nervousness and anxiety, so he began to encourage her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, Clarissa seemed to have found the feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her actions became more and more skilled. In order to help Osborne reach climax, she completely let go of her inhibitions. No longer shy, she occasionally looked up at Osborne. As their eyes met, her face would suddenly blush bright red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time passed slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, his body stiffened and reached climax. Osborne held onto Clarissa's head as his penis released all of his desires inside her warm, wet mouth.</span></p></div>
