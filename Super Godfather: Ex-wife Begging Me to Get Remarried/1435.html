        <h1>Chapter 1434 Your Pride</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all that, Osborne shot Jeffrey a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In response, Jeffrey's expression hardened as he glared back, the air around him thickening with an intense divine power. He was ready for combat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get this started!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Excitement buzzed through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Alick, teach that arrogant human a lesson! Can you believe he thinks he can beat you with just one punch? That's laughable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey huffed, "Oh, don't worry. He'll regret saying that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sudden burst of speed, Jeffrey launched himself at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lachlan, whatever gave you the audacity to act so high and mighty, you're about to pay the price! So get down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Jeffrey was right in front of Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fist, crackling with divine power, rocketed toward Osborne's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air trembled as a catastrophic force released between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the might of a Transcendent Deity warrior; back on Blue Planet, that punch would be enough to shatter a mountain and devastate half a city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Here on Celestara, where the rocks were tougher&mdash;especially in the mines&mdash;everything began to quake as if the very tunnels would collapse under the strain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The raw power sent waves of exhilaration through the onlookers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lachlan is done for!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Alick clearly isn't holding back. He's not aiming for a fatal strike, but he's already giving it his all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lachlan's Malevolence Amulet probably won't survive this hit, or worse, it could leave him severely injured&mdash;like a dead dog lying there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd buzzed with excitement at the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that moment, Osborne was far from passive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood there, unfazed by Jeffery's fierce attack. Even before his powers had fully returned to Superior Deity levels, he felt no fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Osborne, the seemingly powerful Jeffrey was nothing to worry about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calmly, he raised his hand and punched back, matching Jeffrey's ferocity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, their fists collided, producing a thunderous crash that echoed through the air, followed by the ominous sound of Jeffrey's Malevolence Amulet shattering. Then, a figure was sent reeling backward, blood spewing from his mouth as he came crashing down onto the rocks, collapsing and unable to get back up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surrounding crowd fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who had eagerly anticipated Osborne being knocked down by Jeffrey were left gape-mouthed, staring at Osborne, who stood completely still, utterly unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then their eyes turned to Jeffrey, who lay on the ground, blood pooling around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were stunned into silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was unbelievable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey had been knocked away by Osborne's single punch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Jeffrey's centurion Malevolence Amulet had been pulverized in an instant, the powerful shield bursting apart, unable to protect its wielder from Osborne's devastating blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just one punch, Osborne had decisively defeated Jeffrey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp intake of breath echoed through the crowd, shock and fear etched on every face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, merely smiled, his expression calm. To him, injuring Jeffrey with a single punch was a trivial matter, hardly worth his time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said calmly, "I told you it would only take one punch. All that chatter was just a waste of my time. Now, do you believe me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze swept over the onlookers, and an icy chill settled over them, a wave of dread washing through their hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you really think you could insult me, just because I'm from the so-called lowly human? You looked down on me, thinking you could trample my dignity without a second thought. How's that pride treating you now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a glint of coldness in his eyes, Osborne took a step forward, his face a mask of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd shrank back, their fear palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One voice cried out in panic, "What do you think you're doing, Lachlan?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're all soldiers of the Wild Flame Army&mdash;your comrades! Are you really going to attack us? You've already injured Mr. Alick, your direct superior! If the military discipline office finds out, you'll be locked up for sure!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And let's not forget your lowly Human Community status&mdash;you could be executed on the spot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop right now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, I'll report everything that happened here to the military discipline office! My uncle is a centurion there, and with just a flick of my finger, your life is over!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be smart and apologize. Maybe I'll let today's incident slide and keep it from the discipline office."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but laugh at the threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Report me to the discipline office? You think I'm afraid of that? Go ahead, try it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression dripped with sarcasm, and the man's face shifted from pale to flushed with anger and fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is your doing! I'm contacting the discipline office right now!" he spat, his fingers flying to the communicator in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the next moment, confusion and shock washed over his features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's going on? Why can't I reach the discipline office?" he exclaimed, his voice trembling with panic.</span></p></div>
