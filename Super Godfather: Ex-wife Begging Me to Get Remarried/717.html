        <h1>Chapter 717 Emma Broke Through</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa, along with Donna, Dylan, and the others, departed from the island, making their way back to Skyefall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had no reason to hold her back; after all, the bodies of over a hundred Radcliffe family members lay unburied at the Radcliffe Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Clarissa didn't want to leave him either, but now that she had taken on the responsibility of leading the Radcliffe family, she had to focus on rebuilding, even if it meant being apart from him for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Clarissa's current strength, Osborne found some comfort in knowing she could handle herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, he couldn't shake the feeling of longing as he watched her go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon enough, he pushed those thoughts aside. Osborne settled cross-legged on the beach, activating Satan's Eye to absorb star power and boost his own strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only reason they had managed to defeat Luca and the twenty Class AAA Evolved Humans was sheer luck. If his light elemental essence hadn't been so powerful, he would never have broken through Palmers' Dark Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had he not made that timely breakthrough and taken down Palmers, he wouldn't have been able to save Emma, who was on the verge of being overwhelmed by a group of Class AAA Evolved Humans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa wouldn't have stood a chance against Luca either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Luca hesitated to kill her, he could easily have wounded her severely and captured her to hand over to the King of the Aberrants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought sent a chill down Osborne's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At the end of the day, it all comes down to strength! If I had been stronger and already Class AAA, I could have shattered Palmers' Dark Realm with ease. I would have cut down those Class AAA Evolved Humans without breaking a sweat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I were Class AAA, even with the Axe of Strength, defeating Luca would be a walk in the park! I wouldn't even need the Trident of Poseidon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It all boils down to not being strong enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With gritted teeth, Osborne focused his ocular energy on the star power around him, consuming it voraciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap between Class AA and Class AAA was immense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he had recently broken through Class AA and had been frantically absorbing star power and blood energy, he still had a long way to go before reaching Class AAA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time slipped by, and suddenly, Osborne felt a powerful energy surge erupting in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes snapped open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did Emma break through?" Osborne murmured, glancing toward Emma's direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There, she was enveloped in a massive aura pulsating with intense energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, a terrifying force erupted from Emma, causing Osborne to stare in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Emma's eyes flew open, and the overwhelming energy dissipated, all of it returning to her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A look of surprise washed over her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did I really break through? I'm alive! I somehow managed to break into Class AAA! I thought it would take me at least another year or two!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Experiencing life-and-death battles really is the fastest way to level up," Emma murmured to herself, still in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Congratulations on breaking into Class AAA! You're the second member of the Augustine family's younger generation to achieve this, and you're only twenty-five! What incredible talent!" Osborne praised sincerely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A twenty-five-year-old Class AAA metahuman&mdash;she was the fastest to break through that he had ever seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such talent was truly daunting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma turned to him with a smile. "You're only a few months older than me, right? And I heard you've only been training for a few months?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If my talent is impressive, what does that make yours?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Emma finished speaking, Osborne awkwardly rubbed his nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued, "And there's more! My talent isn't all that special. Your girlfriend Clarissa? She's way more impressive than I am! Even if I break through to Class AAA, I might still not stand a chance against her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And she's only just twenty!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know who my idol is? Her name's Vivienne. She broke through to Class AAA before she even turned twenty! Compared to her, I'm miles behind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma finished speaking, stretching and revealing her stunning curves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was momentarily taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Emma's idol is my mother, Vivienne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, "No matter what, congratulations! You've really helped me out this time. If it weren't for you, we wouldn't have had a chance against the Aberrants' ambush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I owe you a huge favor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma raised an eyebrow, a playful smile on her face. "Owe me a favor, huh? So how do you plan to repay it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced around the room. "By the way, where's your girlfriend Clarissa? Isn't she here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied calmly, "She had some matters to attend to. As for repaying you, just tell me what you need. I won't refuse as long as it's within my power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's eyes lit up at his response. "You're really going to hold to that? No backing out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a confident smile. "Don't worry. When I make a promise, I don't go back on it! As long as you don't ask me to do anything illegal or unethical, I'll do my best."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's eyes sparkled with excitement. "Great!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In that case, I want you to help me unlock Satan's Eye!"</span></p></div>
