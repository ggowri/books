        <h1>Chapter 1401 You Might Regret Your Choice</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp scythe of the Goddess of Grain severed the head of the Intermediate Deity in one swift motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook out his arms, as if to rid himself of the nonexistent blood on the blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smile spread across his face as he locked eyes with Patrick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Patrick was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire scene fell silent as everyone, including the captured Harry and Amelia, stood with their mouths agape, incredulity etched on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had just killed one of Patrick's subordinates!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was unfathomable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To them, the Intermediate Deity was formidable, yet in Osborne's hands, he seemed no more threatening than a child. One strike to sever an arm, and another to take his </span><span>head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a dull thud, the lifeless body crashed to the ground, breaking the spell of silence that had gripped everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick's men exchanged fearful glances, their expressions shifting from surprise to fury as they moved swiftly to encircle Osborne, their eyes glinting with malice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you!" one of them shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're asking for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Drop your weapon and surrender!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Surrender!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their voices rang out in fierce unison, the weight of their divine power surging forth like a tidal wave, pressing down on Osborne, attempting to force him to bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Osborne merely chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Just a pack of Intermediate Deities thinking they can intimidate me? If I weren't so badly injured, I could flick my fingers and wipe you all out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He ignored the threats surrounding him, his gaze shifting to Patrick, who wore a frown dark enough to summon storms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calmly, Osborne proposed, "Patrick, let Harry and Amelia go, and we'll leave peacefully. From then on, we won't cross paths. Sounds fair, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The response was complete silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone stared at Osborne as if he were a lunatic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "He just killed Patrick's man and now he wants to negotiate? He really must have a death wish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick couldn't suppress a laugh, but the sound was devoid of humor, a sinister grin twisting across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You expect me to just let them go? And then waltz out of here? They killed my wife's brother, and you've taken one of my own. You think you can pretend nothing happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded with an eerie calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! If you could just overlook this little incident and let </span><span>me</span><span> take Harry and Amelia, it would definitely be the smarter choice for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick's laughter morphed into rage. "Are you threatening me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne met his gaze unwaveringly. "If you insist on interpreting it that way, so be it. But I suggest you think it through. Release Harry and Amelia, and we'll consider this done. Otherwise, you might truly regret your decision."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick's laughter </span><span>erupted,</span><span> a sound of derision echoed by his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They regarded Osborne with the expressions reserved for an utter fool, their eyes glimmering with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you lost your mind?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who do you think you are talking to me like that? I'm a member of the Ninth Dark Deity Legion's reserve! I've been appointed as overseer of this mining area, and all the miners in the surrounding villages answer to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I command a dozen Intermediate Deities, and I'm a Superior Deity myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't even have a Divine Flame ignited! What gives you the gall to speak to me like this? You got lucky with your weapon and killed one of my men. Do you really </span><span>think that's enough to intimidate me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're beneath me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick's face twisted into a predatory sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had invoked the Eclipsing Mantra, cloaking the state of his Divine Flame from view. For Patrick, it seemed Osborne hadn't even ascended to godhood yet. The only reason he had killed one of Patrick's subordinates was that the man had let his guard down, not to mention the advantage Osborne had with the razor-sharp scythe of the Goddess of Grain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick's gaze was fervent as it fixed on the scythe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, that's it? No more negotiation?" Osborne squinted slightly, measuring the tense atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick scoffed, disdain dripping from his words. "What makes you think you're worthy of negotiating with me? With that twisted mind of yours, you're not even fit to be a miner! Kill him right now, and bring me that scythe!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his command, the circle of Intermediate Deities surrounding Osborne erupted in laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Mr. Swift. He's as good as dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, one of the Intermediate Deities lunged forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression darkened. "If there's nothing left to discuss, then come at me! Just remember: you might regret your choice later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He darted forward, his movement a blur as he dodged the strike of the attacking Intermediate Deity. In the blink of an eye, the deity's expression froze, shock finding its way to his face as he felt his upper body sail away from his lower half.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood sprayed from the severed remains of the </span><span>deity,</span><span> his Divine Body bisected by the Goddess of Grain's scythe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was dead before anyone could process what had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Collective disbelief washed over the group. Another Intermediate Deity had fallen&mdash;this time, it wasn't a case of negligence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't merely the sharpness of the scythe at play; Osborne's speed and power were nothing short of astonishing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that his strength was nothing to scoff at!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A heavy silence hung in the air as the Intermediate Deities exchanged wary glances, understanding the grave nature of their situation. "All at once now! Let's take him down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a unified roar, all fourteen Intermediate Deities surged toward Osborne.</span></p></div>
