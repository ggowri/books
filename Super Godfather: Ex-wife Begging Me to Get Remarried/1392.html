        <h1>Chapter 1391 The Deathborn Came</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over thirty </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> surged toward Harry, Vance, and the others, bursting forth from the rocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their forms quickly solidified, revealing sharp claws, jagged teeth, and long, blood-red hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without strategic intelligence, they had no plans for ambush or to observe the fight from the sidelines, ready to swoop in for an easy kill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, they rushed headlong into the fray, considering both sides as mere prey, targets for their insatiable hunger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their sudden appearance turned the tide of battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia, as well as Vance and his team, all felt their hearts sink at the sight of the overwhelming horde charging toward them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! It's the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are there so many? Wasn't this secret passage supposed to be safe from </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>? This is madness! We need to hold them off!" Vance </span><span>shouted,</span><span> his face twisted in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything was unfolding just as he had feared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was already struggling against her assailants, and Harry was losing his grip on the situation. Just when victory seemed within reach, this monstrous wave of </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> crashed into their plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These creatures posed an existential threat; Vance realized he could no longer afford to focus on Harry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he had his grudge against Harry, these </span><span>Deathborns</span><span> had to be dealt with first. If he didn't eliminate them, they would all end up as food for the beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The horror of facing the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> was all too familiar to those born of </span><span>Celestara</span><span>. Once defeated, the only fate that awaited them was a gruesome end&mdash;having their Divine Bodies devoured without a sliver of hope left to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them! Harry! We'll settle our scores later!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have to take out these </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> first!" Vance yelled as he engaged one of the beasts, hoping to rally Harry to his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry hesitated, an irritated snort escaping him. Rather than seizing the opportunity to strike at Vance, he sprinted to Amelia's side, ready to tackle the advancing </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized the overwhelming number of </span><span>Deathborns</span><span> made infighting a foolish risk; any infighting would only benefit their enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the thirty </span><span>Deathborns</span><span>, one was an Intermediate Deity, eight were Junior Deities, and the rest were Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately for Harry, the lone Intermediate Deity </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> had set its sights on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> might have appeared weak before Osborne, trembling under his oppressive aura, but in the face of Harry and his allies, they were terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer power they wielded was daunting; their claws and teeth were weapons capable of piercing defenses that a human god of the same level would typically rely on. Their resilience was equally remarkable&mdash;wounds healed rapidly, making them formidable foes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry found himself at a distinct disadvantage against the Intermediate Deity </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, two Junior Deity </span><span>Deathborns</span><span>, flanked by a dozen Class S </span><span>Deathborns</span><span>, encircled Amelia. Herry and Amelia's situation was becoming increasingly dire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast, Vance and his team were holding their own against just six Junior Deity </span><span>Deathborns</span><span> and a handful of Class S foes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their strength, the battle felt manageable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They quickly dispatched the Class S </span><span>Deathborns</span><span>, and the remaining Junior Deity threats were visibly weakening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching this unfold only fueled Harry's anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry shouted, "Vance, are you going to help us or what? If these </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> kill us, you won't escape unscathed either!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, Vance burst into laughter, a loud, mocking sound that echoed through the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help you? Harry, have you lost your mind? Or do you think I'm the fool? This situation is exactly what I wanted to see! Don't worry; I won't let your sister die&mdash;not yet, anyway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once she's weak from those </span><span>Deathborn's</span><span> attacks, I'll swoop in to save her. After all, she's quite the beauty, and I haven't had the pleasure of sampling her yet. I can't just let her perish like that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll make sure she experiences the wonders of being a woman! Hahaha! As for you, I'd rather see you fall to the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, so I don't have to get my hands dirty!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry felt a surge of rage boil within him at Vance's cruel words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vance, you won't get away with this! But don't forget&mdash;if this Intermediate Deity </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> kills me, you're next! There's no way you can escape!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vance just laughed, unfazed. "Who says I can't?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An Intermediate Deity is nothing! Once I take down these six Junior Deity </span><span>Deathborns</span><span>, it will just leave that one Intermediate Deity. With all six of us together, we can definitely take it down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> you might as well just sit back and wait for your death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a dismissive wave, Vance called to his followers, "Let's wrap this up! Take out these Junior Deity </span><span>Deathborns</span><span>, then we can sit back and watch the show as Harry gets devoured&mdash;skin and all! Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was elated. Despite the unexpected arrival of the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, everything was still falling into place just as he had hoped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia were as good as finished!</span></p></div>
