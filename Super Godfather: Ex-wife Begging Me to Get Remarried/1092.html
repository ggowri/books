        <h1>Chapter 1091 Sin</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood splattered everywhere, but not a drop touched Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had already reached the second assassin from the Eityreia Organization. With a swift swing of his scythe, he decapitated the assassin without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a massacre.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though these assassins were all Class S warriors, they were leagues below the likes of Gerardo and Armstrong, incomparable in strength. Their true power lay in their Stealth Arts, allowing them to silently approach and ambush their targets in a single, deadly strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For most, failing to detect their stealth meant death, no matter how skilled one was. One moment of carelessness could all be over in a heartbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But unfortunately for them, their Stealth Arts were useless against Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne extended his mental strength, effortlessly unraveling their Stealth Arts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a feat only Osborne seemed capable of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether it was due to his extraordinary mental strength or something unique about him, no one else, even Greyson or Roy, could sense the Eityreia assassins even after expanding their mental strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tables had turned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just moments before, these assassins had been hunting the Augustine family, relishing in their screams as they died. Now, they were the hunted, with Osborne hot on their trail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They believed they were still hidden, but little did they know Osborne could see their every move as clear as day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For those nearby, Osborne closed the gap in the blink of an eye, his scythe slicing through the air, and heads flew with chilling precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the ones further away, Osborne didn't hesitate to use his interdimensional travel, appearing directly behind them. The result was always the same: a swift swing of the Goddess of Grain's scythe and another assassin fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his current strength and the razor-sharp scythe in hand, these ordinary Class S assassins didn't stand a chance. Once he was within range, they had no way out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, the sound of flesh being cut echoed through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Osborne darted and twisted, taking down nearly ten Eityreia Organization assassins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Augustine family were left utterly speechless, watching Osborne kill those Class S warriors as easily as killing chickens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These assassins, once invisible predators with their Stealth Arts, had been picking the Augustines off one by one. There was no defense for the Augustines and no way to strike back. Each family member had been in sheer terror, wondering if they would be the next to fall, drowning in hopelessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Osborne had flipped the script. He paid no mind to their Class S ranks. One by one, he hunted them down and eliminated them with cold precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family could barely contain their excitement, their faces flushed with relief and awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, rot in hell!" A sudden roar pierced through the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a figure appeared at Osborne's side, a dagger aimed straight at Osborne's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer force behind the attack exploded in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne narrowed his eyes. He recognized that energy. The attacker was Sin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ranked second among the top assassins of the Eityreia Organization, Sin was a Class S powerhouse, ranked in the top fifty of the Global Quasi-Divine Rankings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin didn't bother using Stealth Arts. He knew they were useless against Osborne. But even without them, he remained a top-tier assassin, and his speed was terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Sin's dagger pierced Osborne's martial art aura and plunged into his body, blood splattering everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" The Augustine family gasped in horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cries of panic filled the air as they watched the fight between Sin and Osborne, believing that Sin had succeeded in killing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon enough, they realized something was wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood with his back to the Augustines, so they couldn't see Osborne's face, but they could see Sin's face clearly. There was no sign of exhilaration after supposedly striking down Osborne. Instead, Sin looked shocked, bordering on terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin's divine artifact dagger, though it had broken through Osborne's martial art aura, had lost most of its power by the time it reached Osborne's flesh. It merely scratched the surface of his skin before being trapped by the very muscles and tissue it had intended to pierce. The blade was still far from reaching Osborne's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne calmly reached out and grabbed Sin's arm. His grip was like an iron vice, and with overwhelming strength, Sin's right hand was immobilized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible? How could you have become this powerful?" Sin was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a few days ago, when Osborne had killed Sin's wife and daughter, Osborne hadn't been this formidable. If it hadn't been for Sin's own injuries at the time and the timely arrival of the Blood Demon members, Sin was certain he could have killed Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Sin's full-force strike had barely scratched Osborne's skin. Sin couldn't even free his arm from Osborne's grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Sin stared at Osborne, who was smirking, a wave of unrelenting fear washed over him.</span></p></div>
