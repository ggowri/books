        <h1>Chapter 1018 Super Materials</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely! I'll get it done!" First shouted enthusiastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the eyes of all four thousand eight hundred Blood Demon members lit up with fierce determination. They all wanted to be part of the Blood Demon Vanguard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't just about glory; it meant they'd have first dibs on divine artifacts, super energy guns, and other cutting-edge weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They would also be the first to receive blood energy supplies!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every one of them was ready to take down their rivals and secure one of the coveted spots in the Vanguard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With only one hundred slots available, only the strongest and bravest would make the cut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne surveyed the crowd, satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were highly trained warriors, transformed into Blood Clan, and they executed his commands without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The selection quickly began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne decided not to stick around; he had complete faith in First's ability to identify the top one hundred members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then ripped open a rift in Dimensional Space and made his way to the Weapons Research Institute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon arriving, he was greeted by Kash, the head of the Institute, who rushed over. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't waste any time, asking, "Kash, can we mass-produce the super energy guns yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kash's expression shifted to one of embarrassment. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm afraid not, Mr. Augustine. We're still struggling with material issues. The team at the Materials Research Institute is working hard, but they haven't yet developed a new material suitable for mass production."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sighed deeply at this news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's bring in the head of the Materials Research Institute. I want to hear the situation directly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, a balding middle-aged man hurried in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was Antonio Mirante, a national treasure in the field of materials science.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, you asked for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Antonio looked weary, as if he hadn't had a decent break in ages. He had been leading his team in a relentless pursuit to solve the material problem for the super energy guns but didn&rsquo;t work out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He feared Osborne was there to hold him responsible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Osborne had approved every request he made for resources, from funding to </span><span>equipment to manpower, but there were no results yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Antonio. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Mirante, how much longer until we can break through with the super material? Do you have a timeline?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Antonio bit his lip, shaking his head. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, I can't give you a definite timeframe. It's incredibly challenging! The material has to withstand the force of divine power bullets, which means it needs to be three times harder than diamond!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right now, we can only produce materials with twice the hardness of diamond. While that's already tougher than most divine artifacts, it's still not enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow, surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "The materials we have are already harder than most divine artifacts, yet that&rsquo;s still not enough?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't a technical expert, nor did he dabble in research, but he knew that the Draco Group's Materials Research Institute was among the best in </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>. If they couldn't make it, then no one could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there anything I can do to help?" Osborne asked, looking for ways to fasten the process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they could successfully develop this super material, it would not only allow for the mass production of super energy guns and boost the Blood Demon members' combat capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it also can be used to create other vital equipment, like bulletproof vests, shields, and even combat drones and robots, making them nearly indestructible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Antonio paused for a moment, deep in thought, before speaking up, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, would it be possible for you to find me the toughest divine artifact available? Analyzing the strongest material might just spark some inspiration! Research in materials science often hinges on trial and error, and a stroke of luck could lead us to a breakthrough maybe in the next moment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne considered this carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The toughest divine artifact, huh? As it happens, I think I have the perfect one on hand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he took out the Goddess of Grain's scythe, a weapon with no special powers beyond its incredible sharpness and durability, capable of slicing through Premium divine artifacts and even top-grade ones with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, handing it over, "Take a look at this. It's called the Goddess of Grain's scythe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In my experience, it's the toughest divine artifact!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Antonio's eyes lit up with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to test it before I know! Mr. Augustine, please follow me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He ran back to the Materials Research Institute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once there, he asked his assistant to bring out a hefty piece of metal, a slab that was 3.9 inches thick. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, this is our latest super material. We call it Ultra Diamond! It's twice as hard as a diamond and tougher than most divine artifacts. Right now, all our </span><span>advanced weaponry is built from Ultra Diamond!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, Mr. Augustine, please take the Goddess of Grain's scythe and cut this slab!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gripped the Goddess of Grain's scythe tightly and swung it down onto the Ultra Diamond slab.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the Ultra Diamond was cleaved perfectly in two, the cut smooth and precise.</span></p></div>
