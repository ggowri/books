        <h1>Chapter 1516 Terrifying Supreme Malevolence Airship</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if the pilot of a Supreme Malevolence Airship is just a Junior Deity, you'd better run as far and as fast as you can! The Supreme Malevolence Airship is equipped with formidable weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The main cannon alone consumes at least a hundred top-grade Essence Crystals with each shot. If you fire it up with over a thousand of those or ten Ultimate Essence Crystals as power sources, you could seriously injure&mdash;even outright kill&mdash;most Deity King warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not just the main cannon, either; each Supreme Malevolence Airship has ten secondary cannons. Just one shot from these requires at least one top-grade Essence Crystal, but that's enough to threaten a Deity Overlord's life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In short, the Supreme Malevolence Airship is an incredibly powerful artifact!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's one of the most potent divine artifacts made by the Artisan Institute. Even we Upper Races can't buy one&mdash;only members of the Paramount Supreme Clan can."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne listened, utterly astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that the Artisan Institute's Malevolence Airships came in five tiers blew his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mere description of the Supreme Malevolence Airship was enough for Osborne to grasp its overwhelming power. With a top speed exceeding 600 thousand miles per hour and the ability to perform simple interdimensional travel, it could blink to a dimensional portal and cover 600 thousand miles in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even at Osborne's current level, with his space elemental essence having reached the peak of Level Six, he could barely manage such feats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the Supreme Malevolence Airship's defenses were so robust that it could withstand several attacks from a Deity King warrior. This airship was nothing short of a super divine artifact, ideal for traveling, self-defense, and survival&mdash;a bug-like existence, indeed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder a Junior Deity piloting one could easily crush any Deity Overlord warrior, provided they had enough Essence Crystals to fuel the beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furthermore, the Supreme Malevolence Airship required, at the very least, top-grade Essence Crystals for operation. If powered by Ultimate Essence Crystals, its effectiveness was significantly enhanced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Terrifying," Osborne muttered, his tone grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given his current strength, encountering a pilot from a Paramount Supreme Clan in a Supreme Malevolence Airship would spell danger for him, no matter their rank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, a deep desire flickered in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, "If I could get my hands on such a powerful Supreme Malevolence Airship, it would change everything! Even just owning an Ultimate Malevolence Airship like Hannah's would be fantastic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But alas, no matter how many Essence Crystals I have, it'll still be out of reach. One day, I'll make all those folks at the Artisan Institute my Blood Clan descendants and have them create divine artifacts just for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah noticed his expression and chuckled. "The Supreme Malevolence Airship is a dream far beyond your reach&mdash;unless you consider going rogue and stealing one. But if you're just after an Ultimate Malevolence Airship, there might be a way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne perked up, his interest piqued. "What's that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah smiled and nodded, saying, "The Artisan Institute only restricts purchases of the Ultimate Malevolence Airship to Upper Races, but it doesn't say anything about us selling them after buying!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Many factions will ask Upper Races to help them purchase an Ultimate Malevolence Airship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The catch is that each Upper Race has a limit on how many they can buy. Usually, they're already stretched thin keeping enough for themselves, so they're reluctant to help others out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up with hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That means there are exceptions, right? Essentially, it all comes down to how many Essence Crystals are on the table! Can you help me buy an Ultimate Malevolence Airship? Essence Crystals aren't an issue&mdash;name your price!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah looked at him, surprised, her brows raised in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah asked, her voice a mix of disbelief and intrigue, "Did you really get your hands on some ancient god's treasure hoard? Can you tell me just how many Essence Crystals you have? A standard price for an Ultimate Malevolence Airship is at least 100 million Essence Crystals. If you're looking to buy from someone, it usually jumps to five times that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You see, my family is a bit cash-strapped these days. We've been thinking about selling off one of our spare Malevolence Airships. If you're interested, I could arrange for you to acquire it. But let me be clear&mdash;the price won't go lower than 500 million!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure you want that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a slight smile, his demeanor calm. "You're serious about selling? 500 million is steep, isn't it? But it's no problem; I'll buy that Ultimate Malevolence Airship from the Gellar family! As for how many Essence Crystals I have, I'm afraid I can't share that. Essence Crystals are meant to be spent; keeping them around serves no real purpose, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah gaped at him, incredulous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're really going through with this? That's 500 million! Most major factions can't even pull together that much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a subtle grin, Osborne emanated an aura of power that enveloped him, obscuring Hannah's view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached into his Dimensional Space and retrieved over four million mid-grade Essence Crystals, carefully stowing them into a Dimensional Bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he handed the bag over to Hannah.</span></p></div>
