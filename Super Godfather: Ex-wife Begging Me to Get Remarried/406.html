        <h1>Chapter 406 A Terrifying Punch</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him, now! Don't let him slow us down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cold voice continued, "Seize a cruise ship fast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne tracked the sound to its source&mdash;a man masked and his voice altered, clearly not wanting to be recognized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he radiated an intense energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was definitely a Class A martial master!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow, speculating, "A Class A martial master? These folks can't be from the Aberrants. They would have no need to hide their identities during an attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More likely, they're from a faction swayed by the Aberrants! Could they be from the Paltrow, Walker, or Luther families? If so, they're still not the main force here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face hardened at the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was no time for pondering. Even if they weren't the Aberrants' main force, they were formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides the man who spoke, at least a dozen other energy signatures, slightly weaker, surrounded them&mdash;Class A- at the least, with hundreds more below Class B.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dozen Class A- fighters, if united, could make even a Class A master think twice. Yet Osborne was on his own, tasked with halting them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't let them near the cruise ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their power, they could easily commandeer it, taking the thousands of passengers hostage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That would put both the Draco Group and the Augustine family in a bind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the command, several masked figures closest to Osborne launched their assault. They were all Class A-, one a water elemental metahuman, the others martial artists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A space elemental metahuman? That's rare. Even in the Draco Group, you must hold a high rank, right? Pity you'll die here today!" sneered the water elemental metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had kept his power in check, so they were unaware he was a Class A martial master, mistaking him for a B+ level space elemental.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Four Class A- fighters against a B+? Child's play.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if Osborne's a space elemental metahuman, he's doomed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he lashed out, causing waves to reverse and surge towards Osborne in mid-air. The other three Class A- martial artists leaped into action, their bodies unleashing terrifying force, aiming for Osborne's vitals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the attack was upon Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He snorted coldly, "Thinking you can pass? Dream on! Stay here, all of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He punched forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A red glow enveloped him, his fist unleashing a torrential force as if to shatter everything before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three Class A-martial artists' attacks never reached Osborne; their eyes widened in terror as they were caught in the force, their bodies exploding with flesh and blood raining over the sea for hundreds of feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had slain three Class A-martial artists, yet his power remained undiminished. He shattered the waves and hurled them at the water elemental metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thunderous crash, the Class A- water elemental met the same fate, unresponsive and annihilated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer force pulverized the surrounding boats, and their occupants were killed before a scream could escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The punch's might was staggering, even to Osborne himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew his body had mutated. When he ascended to Class A martial master, his energy and blood ball dwarfed others at his level by a factor of ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His strength surpassed that of a typical Class A martial master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Osborne never imagined a casual punch could wield such terrifying power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His one punch decimated four Class A- martial artists and a dozen more above Class B.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, only the roaring waves filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All enemies on the boats, including the masked man, gaped in horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was Victor, the third elder of the Paltrow family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the Aberrants' plan, Victor, a Class A martial master, would lead a group of experts from ancient families to swiftly exploit the Draco Group's vulnerabilities and seize control of at least one cruise ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, they would use the passengers as leverage for the Aberrants' next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor was confident in this mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, all went well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Members of the Aberrants drew away most of the defense. Under normal circumstances, they would easily break through and take control of the cruise ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, a space elemental metahuman appeared, blocking their path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor sensed a mere Class B+ metahuman, so he dispatched a few Class A- martial artists to deal with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The outcome was shocking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Class B+ space elemental metahuman was also a Class A martial master! A punch so fearsome! Even Victor wasn't sure he could deliver it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor finally snapped to his senses, his face grave. "Attack together! Even if he's a Class A martial master, even if he's mastered both martial arts and powers, he can't hold off so many of us! Strike together. Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he led the charge, unleashing the terrifying power of a Class A martial master towards Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simultaneously, the remaining Class A- fighters joined the assault.</span></p></div>
