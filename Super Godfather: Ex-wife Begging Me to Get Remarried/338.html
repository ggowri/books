        <h1>Chapter 338 The Ghost Ship</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the warning from Satan's Eye, Osborne suddenly opened his eyes and looked outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thick mist rose on the sea, and there was a strange ship with a skull flag in it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ship was not big. It looked old as if it was a wooden boat from a hundred years ago, but it was fast, shuttling quickly through the mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ship stopped when it was only three miles away from the Alisa Ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, more than a dozen figures flew out from the ship. They stepped on the waves and moved quickly towards Alisa Ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Skull flag. It's the Ghost Ship. It finally came!" Osborne murmured and rushed out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He woke up Yulissa. "Inform everyone to be prepared. The Ghost Ship is coming, and </span><span>more than a dozen enemies are approaching quickly. I'll hold them back first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Protect yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Osborne rushed out of the room and came to the deck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ghost Ship was coming!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a flash of anger and murderous intent in her eyes, but she did not lose her mind. Remembering Osborne's instructions, she rushed to Ryan and Nathan's rooms and woke them up. "The Ghost Ship is coming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, everyone started moving. All the members of the escort team took weapons and came to the deck. Ryan, Nathan, Yulissa, and two members of The Wise Order also went to the deck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mist on the sea was too thick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with telescopes, they couldn't see anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yulissa, where is Osborne?" A member of The Wise Order went to the deck with a serious look and asked Yulissa. He had gray hair and looked at least sixty or seventy years old, but he was as energetic as a young man. His eyes were full of composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was Jacob Augustine, the ninth elder of the Augustine family's Wise Order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty years ago, he had failed to break through Class A, but luckily, he survived and became a metahuman in Class A-. He had been the elder of the Augustine family ever since.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other person behind Jacob was Layla Augustine, the tenth elder. She was younger than Jacob, probably in her fifties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten years ago, Layla had failed to break through Class A but survived like Jacob. She was a metahuman in Class A-, serving as an elder of the Augustine family's Wise Order ever since.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yulissa, are you sure it's the Ghost Ship? Has it arrived?" Layla asked with a frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at the misty sea but couldn't see the Ghost Ship or Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa bit her lip and said, "Osborne told me this. I don't know where he is now. When I rushed to the deck, I didn't see him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She became a little anxious. "Jacob, Layla, will Osborne be in danger? He said he came out to help us buy time. Could it be that he went to fight with those people from the Ghost Ship? It's too dangerous. Let's go to save him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa was in a panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacob and Layla looked at each other and said, "Osborne has excellent eyesight. We didn't notice the pirates last night, but he did. He's probably right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Ghost Ship may really be coming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, the two of them looked solemn and anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were the older generation of the Augustine family, and they knew better about the Ghost Ship than Yulissa and others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were more aware of the power and weirdness of the Ghost Ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was precisely because of this that they knew the seriousness of this situation. Osborne went alone to stop those people from the Ghost Ship. It was too dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Layla made up her mind and said, "We must save Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is the heir and hope of our family. We can't let him die here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jacob, stay on the ship and protect the juniors as well as the safety of the ship and the passengers. I will go to help Osborne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can you help? We don't know where Osborne is now." Jacob frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne is over there!" A voice suddenly sounded. Everyone turned around and found that the person who spoke was Kendra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra said anxiously, "Believe me, I can sense it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne is in that direction. Not far from him, more than a dozen powerful people are approaching. He is in danger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing what she said, everyone looked solemn and no longer hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jacob, protect everyone here!" Layla lifted herself with the surging power and rushed toward the direction Kendra pointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was about two miles away, staring at a dozen figures in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dozen people wore black cloaks that completely covered their faces. The energy fluctuations bursting out from them made Osborne know that they were extremely powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weakest among them was in Class B+.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least five of them made Osborne feel the threat. Their power definitely reached Class A-.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five strong people&nbsp;in Class A-?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was really challenging to deal with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was shocked, thinking, "The Ghost Ship actually sent such a powerful group! No wonder Allen, the head of the Augustine family, died in their hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They sent five strong people&nbsp;in Class A- to kill me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Humph, they really think highly of me."</span></p></div>
