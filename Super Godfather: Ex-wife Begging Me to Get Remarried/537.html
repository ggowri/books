        <h1>Chapter 537 Star Power</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The news that Osborne had signed up for the Branch Bloodline Competition soon became known to the schemers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the First Estate in Mount Seven, Lance looked quite calm. Only when he waved his hand for the others to leave did he murmur, "Is Osborne going to be the new challenge as my master said? Hmph, no matter if you are or not, you'd better not come to challenge me or ruin my plan. Otherwise, I will kill you even if I expose my power!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon saying that, Lance continued his retreat to study and cultivate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the Third Estate, David appeared eerily from the shadows, sneering, "Is Osborne truly going to be in the Branch Bloodline Competition? In that case, don't blame me for being rude! He better pray that he is defeated before he meets me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Otherwise, I'll slit his throat from behind!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, David disappeared eerily once again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evelynn also got the news at Mount Four.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She sneered, "Osborne, you truly can't help but participate in the Branch Bloodline Competition after all. Very well, I will see how you die this time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Spread some news out secretly, and get those contestants from the branch bloodlines to target Osborne. As long as I can injure him, I'll be sure to give them the benefit!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When her subordinates left, Evelynn pondered silently, "Osborne doesn't seem to have brought Fatebearer of the Radcliffe family with him this time. That means the divine artifact is still in Fatebearer's hands, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evelynn's eyes showed surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought, "Osborne has belonged to the branch bloodline. According to the family rules, neither Owen nor I can fight him directly, but Fatebearer of the Radcliffe family isn't from the Augustine family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I can definitely go to Dampston right now to find Fatebearer and grab that divine artifact! As long as I'm careful, Osborne won't know I have done it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If we have that divine artifact, I'll even be able to beat Osborne easily!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking of this, Evelynn couldn't wait any longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She immediately sneaked away from the Augustine family and rushed to Dampston, looking for Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Osborne knew nothing about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After he got up to the top floor of the mansion, his eyes were filled with anticipation and excitement as he looked at the gorgeous and starry sky above his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "I'll absorb the star power today, and I'll reach level six with Satan's Eye! Unfortunately, I have to absorb a total of seven days of the star power before I can promote to level six. I won't finish it before the Branch Bloodline Competition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I hope nothing will go wrong."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne took a deep breath, found a place to cross his legs, and sat down, looking up at the North Star.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He needed to face the direction of the North Star to turn on Satan's Eye and use it to absorb the invisible power scattered by the stars to enhance it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne didn't know if the process was dangerous or not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he was sure it couldn't be simple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it were simple, it wouldn't be so rare for the Augustine family to have a Satan's Eye at level six.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Here we go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Osborne found the direction of the North Star, he instantly turned on Satan's Eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Five light golden star points appeared in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At first, Osborne didn't feel anything, as if he just turned on his Satan's Eye. There was nothing unusual except that the world in front of him became clearer and the starlight became brighter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Osborne gradually felt that something was wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Satan's Eye was continuously turned on, Osborne kept looking in the direction of the North Star. Gradually, he felt as if a cold and invisible force was attracted and spilled into his Satan's Eye through the starlight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Little by little, Osborne felt as if Satan's Eye was being frozen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This freezing power was nothing at first, but as time passed, it became terrifying. Osborne felt like his body was going to be frozen, even his soul was being frozen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne looked panicked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "I see. The power of the stars is not so easily absorbed, and even my body and soul could be frozen and injured if I'm not careful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">An average person might not withstand it for only half an hour, and they would have to stop and wait for their body and soul to recover. If they wanted to break through to level six, they would have to gradually adapt their bodies and souls to this icy power by trying again and again to last longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, it would be possible for them to absorb the star power for seven days in a row and make Satan's Eye break through to level six.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How long will it take me to adapt? Different people will need varying amounts of time. Some people may have enough for a month or two, while others may need many years or even a lifetime to adapt, so they will never break through to the sixth level."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne instantly figured out the key point.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, the power of the stars was freezing his body and soul, causing damage to them, but his Satan's Eye diffused a power that quickly repaired the injuries to his body and soul.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne felt that his body and soul seemed to have been boosted a little after absorbing the star power. Although he didn't get much of a promotion, he did feel much better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the same time, Osborne felt that his Satan's Eye was gradually becoming more powerful, as if he was slowly undergoing some sort of transformation.</p></div>
