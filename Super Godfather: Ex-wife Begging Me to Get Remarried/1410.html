        <h1>Chapter 1409 They're Coming</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man holding the Spirit Tracer spoke with confidence, "Mr. Swift, we should be right on target! According to the latest map of the mine, the end of this tunnel is just ahead. But somehow, Harry and Amelia managed to push deeper into the depths&mdash;over 30 miles!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If all goes well, that secret passage they control must be around here somewhere."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lachlan scoffed. "Hiding in the depths of the mine? They're just buying themselves a little more time! What's the point? We need to find that secret passage and send them straight to hell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without missing a beat, Lachlan's nine Superior Deity subordinates sprang into action, quickly uncovering the entrance to the hidden passage, which was obscured by rocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Swift, we found it!" one of them announced, clearing the stones to reveal a narrow, dark tunnel ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lachlan couldn't help but snicker. "Hiding like rats? They'd be better off sticking their necks out for me to slice! This is just a pitiful struggle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped forward, ready to lead the way into the tunnel, when a hand shot up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One man volunteered, saying, "Mr. Swift, let me go first!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harry and Amelia have probably set traps or snares in that passage. You're powerful enough to handle it, but there's really no need for you to take unnecessary risks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me be the one to scout ahead; I'll check things out, and you all can follow a few hundred yards behind. That way, if anything goes wrong, you'll be in a position to back me up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I'm stronger! I should lead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I insist on going up front!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me take the lead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All nine of Lachlan's subordinates were clamoring to be in front.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He watched them with a cold smile, seeing through the surface politeness that dripped from their words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They weren't trying to protect him out of loyalty; they were fighting to be the first in line to reap the spoils.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of them were eyeing the Essence Crystals that Harry and Amelia surely possessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whoever made it to them first would get a hefty reward, significantly boosting their power within the Ninth Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this world, strength was everything. The more power one had, the higher one climbed through the ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lachlan seethed internally. "Look at these fools. They pretend to respect me as their captain, yet deep down, they see me merely as a human practitioner to be scorned. The moment there's a chance for profit, they're all ready to pounce like hungry wolves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though frustrated, he knew better than to voice his anger aloud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His subordinates were all Dark Deities, beings from a stronger race, and even he, their captain, had to tread carefully around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he conceded. "Alright then, since Hess suggested leading, let him take the front.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if any of you are feeling particularly brave, you're welcome to join him. You all seem eager to face danger. Once we capture Harry and Amelia, I'll make sure to set up some commendations for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the nine were satisfied; their competitive spirits calmed, at least for the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ultimately, four of them wouldn't back down from the chance at the spoils and formed a team to be the first to plunge into the narrow secret passage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lachlan, along with the remaining five, fell into step behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the front four hurried forward, driven by the allure of the Essence Crystals, they quickly pulled away, increasing the distance between themselves and Lachlan's group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did they know, there was someone watching them from the shadows&mdash;Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was taken aback to see a ten-man combat squad from the Ninth Dark Deity Legion approaching. The leader was a human warrior, a Transcendent Deity. The other nine were Dark Deities, all at the Superior Deity level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought quickly, "The nine clearly respect their human leader, but inwardly they despise him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This shows just how dire the situation is for humans in East Zone Nine. Even if they join Lord Malevolence and become full members of the Ninth Dark Deity Legion, they remain at the bottom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This captain is a Transcendent Deity yet is manipulated by his Superior Deity subordinates?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Working for Lord Malevolence makes him an enemy of humanity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with his Transcendent Deity strength, it won't be easy to take him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, they split up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne eyed the four Superior Deities in front, calculating his next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He soon had a plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once they're deep into the mine, I'll collapse the entire tunnel. This will slow their pursuit and split them into two groups, unable to aid each other. That gives me a better shot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waited patiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the vanguard had moved two miles ahead of Lachlan, delving over ten miles into the mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne decided it was time to act.</span></p></div>
