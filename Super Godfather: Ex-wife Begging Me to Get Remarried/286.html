        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since I killed him, I shall erase all the potential trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes turned cold, and the other bullets hovering in the air were also shot back, each hitting a member of the Ashford family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None had time to react before being blasted by bullets, which retained their power to pierce through others' bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These bullets could even turn!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Osborne's ocular energy, these bullets were like hidden weapons that could be controlled at will. In the blink of an eye, dozens of executives and bodyguards of the Ashford family were killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Corpses fell to the ground one after another, and screams rang out instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the Caldwell family was terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they soon discovered that those who died were all members of the Ashford family, and no one from the Caldwell family was hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a moment, the last member of the Ashford family fell to the ground unwillingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the head of the Ashford family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After eliminating the Ashfords, Osborne lost control of the bullets, which clattered to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at every </span><span>Caldwell,</span><span> his eyes full of indifference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne considered using this chance to wipe out the Caldwell family as well, as they had mistreated him during the three years of his marriage to Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, he gave up the idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No need!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't bloodthirsty, and the Caldwells' bullying didn't make them his enemies deserving of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, the Caldwell family would never dare to provoke him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said calmly, "You'd better not tell anyone about what happened today. Otherwise, if you're silenced, don't blame me for not reminding you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, he waved goodbye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the last time I will save you. From now on, I have nothing to do with you! Don't mess with me again, or I won't mind killing you all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finishing speaking that, he walked towards the door step by step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the corpses all over the ground, Osborne did not care. Serena would arrange for someone to clean them up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia, Evelyn, and others were still in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of the Ashford family's senior executives and bodyguards were killed just like that, and Osborne even just stood there without moving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of skill was this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was Osborne a god?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia was astonished to realize she barely knew Osborne. She believed Osborne was powerful, yet only now realized he exceeded her expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn thought so, too. She was utterly astonished by Osborne's killing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It turns out that he is so powerful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn bit her lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Osborne was about to leave, Evelyn looked anxious and immediately took a step forward, wanting to catch up with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she discovered that Ophelia was also chasing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, both of them stopped and looked at each other with bitterness in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What right did they have to chase after him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had made it clear that he no longer had any relationship with the Caldwell family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they were unwilling to give up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia bit her lip and suddenly mustered up the courage to shout at Osborne's back, "Osborne! Can we go back to the past? I was wrong! I really know I was wrong!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne ignored it, and his expression did not change, so he continued to walk out the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An expression of pain suddenly appeared on Ophelia's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne halted, faced her, and scolded her for shamelessness, she might find solace, as it would indicate she retained a spot in his affections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Osborne hated her, she would be delighted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, no!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne did not respond, so indifferent as if he did not know her, as if he was telling her...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was nobody to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't care anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia clenched her teeth as tears flowed down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly shouted again, "Osborne, I won't give up! I will make up for my mistakes! I will never give up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Never!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Ophelia's shouts, Osborne still did not respond at all. He walked out coldly and soon disappeared outside the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia appeared exhausted, collapsing to the ground in confusion and despair, her delicate features etched with pain and remorse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn looked at Ophelia, hesitating, but ultimately said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia would never give up?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But </span><span>so</span><span> what?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't change anything now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps their disappearance from Osborne's world was the best reward for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia was right when she said that they were no longer from the same world!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had entered a higher-level world that they couldn't step into, no matter how hard they tried!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne left, and Evelyn felt desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne didn't know all this, nor did he want to know. He just wanted to return to the Radcliffe Manor for Clarissa and hug her tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia, his ex-wife, meant nothing to him now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His present and future would only have Clarissa!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ding-dong!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne's Draco Star Wristlet made a prompt sound, and Osborne was immediately delighted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My fourth successor test is finally completed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've been expecting it for a long time!"</span></p></div>
