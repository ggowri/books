        <h1>Chapter 909 The Last Move</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half an hour had passed since Osborne last unleashed the Light of Redemption.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, as he called upon it again, a radiant glow enveloped him. In an instant, his wounds healed, his energy surged, and his mental strength was restored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if he had been reborn, standing at the peak of his power once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the rush of strength coursing through him, Osborne turned to Isa, his eyes blazing with renewed determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, let's try again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smiled, "Bring everything you've got! If you can't take me down today, you might find it a lot harder to beat me in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded but didn</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>t say anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he focused, summoning his strength. "Light Realm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that going toe-to-toe with Isa in a battle of strength or skill was futile. He needed the advantage of his Realm's power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Light Realm enveloped Isa, her expression shifted to one of surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your light elemental essence has been unsealed? Who did that for you?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment but then replied in secret, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, how did you know my light elemental essence was sealed? It was the God of Star who helped me unseal it. He's an ancient deity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?" Isa nodded in understanding, her gaze piercing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't expect you'd met him! If he's the one who helped you, that makes sense. But </span><span>a Level Four Light Realm won't be enough to handle me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Osborne could respond, Isa moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a powerful kick, she struck the Light Realm, and Osborne's face paled as he felt the shockwave. A portion of his Level Four Realm shattered under her blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a Level Four Realm, solid as iron, and even most Class S Supreme Overlords couldn't master it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Breaking through the Level Four Realm was no easy feat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Level Four Light Realm was incredibly demanding in terms of energy, and Osborne couldn't maintain it for long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, in an instant, Isa had created a gaping hole in it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression grew serious; he knew he couldn't hesitate any longer. It was time to unleash his ultimate moves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Destruction Orbs! Disintegration Rays!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dazzling array of light cascaded down like rain, surrounding Isa. Anything that touched those shimmering orbs would be obliterated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simultaneously, countless rays shot forth, piercing through anything in their path, all aimed directly at Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face lit up with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The combination of Destruction Orbs and Disintegration Rays, enhanced by the Level Four Light Realm, was his most formidable attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hoped to catch Isa off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa, however, simply watched the onslaught approach with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not bad! Looks like he taught you some real skills."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she moved again, her demeanor as casual as ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She simply struck a kicked, seems effortless yet powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, all the Destruction Orbs and Disintegration Rays shattered before they even touched Isa, causing her no harm whatsoever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd thought that such a powerful attack, if it were aimed at him, would have left him battered and bruised, if not gravely injured. But Isa had erased it with such ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair truly gripped Osborne now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd below the arena had fallen into stunned silence, their mouths agape as they watched the two combatants. Even they could feel the weight of Osborne's hopelessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa was simply too strong, like an impenetrable fortress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had already given his all, even unleashing his Level Four Light Realm, yet he hadn't even managed to push Isa back an inch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa remained as nonchalant as ever, making the sense of despair almost suffocating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt like he was about to choke on his own frustration. He stared at Isa, who wore a smile on her face, and took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Isa, I got this one last move!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this doesn't work, I'm out of options!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's smile widened. "Go ahead, then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took another deep breath. "Then watch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vampire Transformation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Breath of Celestial!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce shout, Osborne began to channel his remaining power. He activated the Divine Bone in his right leg, drawing on its divine power to deliver a devastating kick aimed at Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Explosive Force!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kick represented the full extent of Osborne's strength. If Isa could deflect this with ease, he would have no choice but to concede.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The kick unleashed a terrifying force, lighting Isa's eyes in surprise. But she said nothing. Instead, she raised her leg and gave a matching kick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shockwaves were immense.</span></p></div>
