This time, I lost big. If you don't help me unlock Satan's Eye, I'll haunt you forever!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned by her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help you unlock Satan's Eye? What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Emma blushed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought Osborne was playing dumb. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Emma glared at him. She tried to speak, but immediately spat out another mouthful of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned and quickly said, "Don't talk anymore, just rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked up at Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa and Luca were still in a fierce battle, with no time to use Divine Healing on Emma. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had already used the Light of Redemption once before and couldn't use it again right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hang in there a little longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gently lifted Emma onto his back, instantly transforming into a vampire, using his blood-red hair to securely bind her to his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll take you with me to fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, facing the remaining eleven Class AAA Evolved Human.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gripped the Goddess of Grain's scythe, his eyes burning with killing intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're all going to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Osborne attacked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma lay on Osborne's back, feeling his strong frame. Smelling his masculine scent, and hearing his words, she blushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne punched Titan, sending him flying, then turned and delivered another punch to Tauren's head, using Deadly Force to kill him instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ten left!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured, then suddenly pointed at Medusa, who was trying to use her ultimate move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thunder of Judgment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying thunderbolt descended instantly, interrupting Medusa's move. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tried to dodge desperately but was still struck, causing half of her body to vanish instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dissolving Light!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A beam of light flashed quickly, piercing through Medusa's head, and she collapsed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nine left!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne transformed into a god of slaughter, disregarding the drain on his power, unleashing various ultimate moves and hidden techniques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved his hand, tearing the space apart, creating countless dimensional rifts within a radius of hundreds of yards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Emma on his back, he walked into a dimensional rift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, they appeared behind Werewolf. The Werewolf reacted quickly, attempting to dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp Goddess of Grain's scythe easily sliced off his head, leaving his body to lunge forward while his head stayed behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood sprayed wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eight left!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne panted heavily, feeling the extreme drain on his energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth and suddenly waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, the thick blood mist on the battlefield began to converge toward Osborne, absorbed by the Blood Cross within him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The immense blood energy seemed to revive the Blood Cross, sending waves of terrifying power coursing through it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's exhausted body felt replenished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne entered another dimensional rift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining eight Class AAA Evolved Humans were frantically attacking at this moment, shattering all the dimensional rifts around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't get close to them, so he appeared about one hundred yards behind Medusa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa didn't hesitate and immediately turned to run.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think you can escape?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted coldly. "Spatial Prison!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the space around Medusa transformed into a solid prison, trapping her inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa panicked, attacking frantically, trying to break free from the Spatial Prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that moment, another bolt of lightning struck down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thunder of Judgment!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa, trapped in the Sp</span><span>atial Prison, had barely managed to break free but didn't have tim</span><span>e to escape before the Thunder of Judgment struck her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body instantly vanished in the purple lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seven left!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked coldly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he was like a god of slaughter, unleashing terrifying attacks that left Emma, clinging to his back, utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, Emma thought her strength wasn't any weaker than Osborne's or Clarissa's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, </span><span>Emma</span><span> realized she was wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though they were all Class AA, both Clarissa and Osborne were significantly stronger than her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the very least, there was no way she could kill Class AAA Evolved Human like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with the Swallow Shield, she wouldn't be able to withstand Luca's attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since she was a child, Emma had been considered the greatest talent of the Augustine family, far surpassing even Vincent and Matthew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Emma realized that the true genius of the Augustine family wasn't her, but Osborne!</span></p></div>
