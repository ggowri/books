        <h1>Chapter 877 Humiliation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clay was buzzing with excitement and confidence, convinced he could take Osborne down, but he wasn't about to underestimate his opponent.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a flash, he unleashed his Light Realm, a shimmering field of energy that enveloped Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, to Clay's surprise, Osborne showed no reaction whatsoever.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clay laughed, a mocking glint in his eyes. "Ha! Look at you!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I heard you were only Class AA a month ago. Sure, you've leveled up to Class AAA now, but you're still the weakest of the bunch!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Anyone here could wipe the floor with you! You've probably never even felt the true power of a Realm before. And yet, here you are, standing still while my Light Realm surrounds you? Pathetic!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"With your meager skills, you think you can host an Honor Quest Ceremony? Enjoy your humiliation, Osborne!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Being defeated by my Light Realm will be the greatest achievement of your life!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, he shouted, "Attack!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, the Light Realm erupted with blinding beams of energy, all aimed directly at Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was his Dissolving Light technique.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clay was determined to finish Osborne in one swift blow, ensuring his defeat was as humiliating as possible.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Osborne's expression remained eerily calm. "You sure do love to talk, don't you? After all that bluster, is this really the best you can do?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What a waste of time!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a sudden shift, Osborne began walking toward Clay, completely ignoring the oncoming attack.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as the beams of light were about to strike Osborne, they inexplicably veered off course, curving around him as if guided by an unseen force.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a heartbeat, Osborne stood just a few feet away from Clay, who was left dumbfounded.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What? How is this possible?" Clay stammered, his mind racing.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "This is my Light Realm! I'm supposed to be a god in here! How did my attack miss him?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Clay felt a chilling loss of control over his own power.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was an experience unlike any he had ever faced before.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne couldn't help but smirk at Clay's bewilderment. Clay's Light Realm was merely a Primary Realm, while Osborne had mastered a Level Four Light Realm.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His command over light elements far surpassed Clay's.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though it was Clay's Realm, Osborne could still exert his will over Clay's power.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clay thought he could use the Light Realm against Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That was a death wish.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's gaze bore into Clay as he said coolly, "What's so impossible about it? You wanted to defeat me and turn my Honor Quest Ceremony into a spectacle of shame, didn't you?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Too bad for you, that's not happening.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now, you're about to lose."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Osborne suddenly swung his hand, delivering what appeared to be a casual slap. It looked effortless, almost slow.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Under normal circumstances, Clay would have easily dodged or countered.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But at that moment, terror gripped Clay as he realized he couldn't move. He was frozen in place, helplessly watching Osborne's hand descend toward his face.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sound of the slap echoed through the arena, and Clay was sent spiraling backward, his body twisting in mid-air as blood and teeth sprayed from his mouth, splattering across the ground.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clay's body slammed heavily to the ground, and the next moment, Osborne's foot was planted firmly on his chest.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking down at him from above, Osborne said, "So, this is what you meant by anyone here being stronger than me? This is what you call the weakest among Class AAA? You wanted my Honor Quest Ceremony to become a disgrace?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Someone like you doesn't even deserve to say such things! Even if you managed to unleash your Realm, you wouldn't be able to withstand a single blow from me. And yet you dared to step up here and make a fool of yourself?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Pathetic!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clay felt as if a mountain was crushing him. He struggled to move but found himself completely immobilized. Staring up at Osborne, listening to the mocking words, Clay felt anger surging through him, but he couldn't help but spit out a mouthful of blood.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You bastard! You... ah!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He tried to retort, but Osborne pressed down harder, eliciting a bone-chilling scream from Clay as he felt the sharp crack of his ribs breaking under the pressure.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stop!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A cold voice rang out from above the platform.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everett had risen to his feet, glaring at Osborne, who stood over his grandson Clay.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The air around Osborne crackled with the immense pressure of a Class S powerhouse.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne met Everett's gaze with a calm smile. "He hasn't surrendered yet. Why should I stop? The rules of the Honor Quest Ceremony say we can't kill, but they never mentioned anything about hurting, did they?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, he pressed down even harder.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sound of Clay's ribs snapping echoed grotesquely as he let out another agonizing scream, his body writhing in pain.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, his head lolled to one side, and he lost consciousness.</p></div>
