        <h1>Chapter 757 Battling Against Roger</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne thought to himself, "Could this really be something Rhett caused? Maybe he got mixed up with Roger or Eityreia Organization during his time outside?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The situation was giving Osborne a headache.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He really didn't want to fight Roger. He could tell just how dangerous this guy was, especially with those deadly assassination skills and that dagger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The pressure was intense, especially since Osborne couldn't afford to reveal his true identity or use Satan's Eye. Facing someone like Roger with his hands tied wasn't exactly ideal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the arena rules were clear. There was no backing out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne kept his eyes on Roger and tried to find a way out. "Look, does it really have to go down like this? If you want compensation, we can talk."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger's sneer was cold. "Compensation? You think I'm interested in that? Either you step up and die now, or get ready for your entire family to pay the price."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The scorn in Roger's voice was clear as day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's expression hardened, his eyes narrowing. He didn't want to fight, but that didn't mean he was scared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, with Roger pushing this hard, it looked like a fight was inevitable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as Osborne was about to step forward, Stuart, who had recovered, blocked his way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Axell, this isn't your problem. Don't throw your life away for me. I caused this mess, and I'll handle it myself!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart's determination caught Osborne by surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though he knew he didn't stand a chance against Roger, Stuart refused to drag anyone else into his fight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the way he planned to handle it was basically a death sentence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With his current strength, facing Roger would be suicide.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne grabbed Stuart's arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're not going to survive if you go up there. Let me deal with this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart looked shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You? If I can't beat him, you definitely can't. I'm at Class AAA, and you're only at Class AA. I'm not letting you get yourself killed. Even with your energy gun, if you can't see him, you're toast!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart bit his lip, his resolve firm. "If someone has to die, it should be me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne sighed. "I've got a plan."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart stared at him. "You're not just trying to make me feel better?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You'll see," Osborne replied with a slight smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before Stuart could argue, Osborne was already on the platform, his gaze locked onto Roger with an icy determination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Osborne step onto the platform, Roger sneered, "You family folks really stick together, huh? Even when it comes to dying, you're eager to take turns. Fine, I'll grant your wish.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This only ends when I take your life or you somehow manage to take mine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And trust me, I'm going to enjoy cutting off your head."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With those chilling words, Roger's figure abruptly vanished, leaving not even a whisper of energy behind. He seemed to have melted into thin air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne remained calm, standing still without activating Satan's Eye or any defensive measures.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His lack of action surprised everyone watching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's he doing? Has he already given up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's not even defending himself. Is he asking to get killed?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart and Vivian, watching from the sidelines, were pale with worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Axell, be careful!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, a shadowy figure materialized behind Osborne. It was Roger. He reappeared without the slightest disturbance, his dagger aiming straight for Osborne's neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart and Vivian barely had time to react, but it was too late.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The dagger seemed to slice through Osborne's neck, yet Roger's expression quickly shifted to confusion. There was no resistance, no contact at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"An illusion?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger immediately realized he'd been tricked and vanished again just as Osborne's fist shot toward him, missing by a fraction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Quick reflexes," Osborne muttered, a slight frown crossing his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had anticipated and dodged Roger's attack almost instantly, but Roger had managed to slip away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger vanished once more, leaving Osborne standing still, waiting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the blink of an eye, Roger reappeared behind Osborne, his movements even faster this time, his dagger slashing in utter silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By all rights, Osborne shouldn't have been able to react.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But once again, he effortlessly dodged the strike, countering with a punch even quicker than before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This time, Roger couldn't evade. Osborne's fist connected, sending Roger flying across the platform, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Shocked, Roger glared at Osborne, his eyes burning with anger and disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You... you can actually see my attacks? That's impossible! How are you doing this?"</p></div>
