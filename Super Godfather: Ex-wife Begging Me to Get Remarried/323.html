        <h1>Chapter 323 Jump Down by Yourself</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood spurted out of Yohan's mouth, his eyes were dazed, and Osborne's palm was like a huge door panel, hitting him hard in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mind was buzzing, with a ringing in his ears and dizziness, leaving him completely baffled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dark clouds and thunder in the sky quickly dissipated because he was no longer in control of them. The fiery sun appeared once again, shining down on the deck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne didn't let him go just like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt somewhat annoyed. Yohan actually wanted Osborne to give up Clarissa, asking him to get out of Pinchide City and not come back before Clarissa and Alexander's wedding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, Yohan would kill Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What made him think so?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne grabbed Yohan's neck and started to slap him hard on his left and right face. Worried that he might accidentally kill Yohan with a single strike, Osborne even exerted very little force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even so, it was more than Yohan could bear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a pure metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tall and strong body was only slightly stronger than that of ordinary people. Compared with Osborne, who was like a Tyrannosaurus Rex, Yohan was completely not on the same level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time a slap landed, Yohan would spit out a mouthful of blood and several teeth would fall off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within moments, both rows of teeth in Yohan's mouth completely vanished, leaving his mouth filled with blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!" Finally, Lauren reacted and shouted loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her palm was surrounded by the glow of lightning, then she suddenly struck towards Osborne, attempting to rescue Yohan from his grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was cold. He grabbed Yohan's arm and led him backward, avoiding Lauren's attack. With an indifferent expression, Osborne firmly held onto his arm and retreated, evading Lauren's attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at her coldly. "Do you want to die, too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lauren's face changed. Feeling Osborne's anger, she couldn't help swallowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that the thing she was most worried about had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that the intelligence was incorrect. Osborne's strength was far beyond what she and Yohan could handle. Yohan hadn't even made a move in Osborne's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the entire younger generation of the Paltrow family, only Alexander could surpass him in strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lauren gritted her teeth and said, "Osborne, let him go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, this matter is our fault. We were also acting under orders. As long as you let him go, I can take him away immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne sneered, "Do you ask me to let him go and let you take him away? On what grounds? Do you think you can come and go as you please? What do you take me for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lauren's face changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she still gritted her teeth and said, "We are from the Paltrow family! As the heir, you should be very clear about the situation of the Augustine family. At this time, you really shouldn't make enemies with the Paltrow family. Otherwise, the Augustine family will be in danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've vented enough, so it's time to let him go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she finished speaking, Ryan, Nathan and Yulissa couldn't help but change their expressions and looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Nathan, known for his fiery temper, felt at this moment that since Osborne had already vented his anger, it was time to let Yohan go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne couldn't help but burst out laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Lauren coldly. "Just because you are from the Paltrow family, you come to provoke me, and require me to let you go obediently, right? Do you really think you are a big shot?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Others are afraid of your threats, but I, Osborne, am not!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you have the guts, the Paltrow family can come and deal with me, as long as you are not afraid of death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finishing saying that, Osborne delivered another fierce slap, landing heavily on Yohan's dreadful face, causing his jaw to dislocate and knocking him unconscious instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he looked at Lauren provocatively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hit him again, but what can you do to me? Do you want to hit me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clenched her fists, her pretty face full of anger, but Lauren still did not lose her mind. She took a deep breath to suppress her anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you've gone too far!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's just how I am, so what? While I'm in a good mood now, I'll give you a choice! Take him and jump into the sea from here immediately!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't want to jump, then I don't mind giving you a facelift so you can look like him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, he threw the limp Yohan at Lauren's feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take him and jump down. Get out of my sight!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, I will take action! I will only give you ten seconds to consider.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ten!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne counted down coldly, and Lauren's face became extremely gloomy, and her body trembled violently with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who was she?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was Lauren, from the Paltrow family, the strongest among the younger generation of the Paltrow family. Apart from the heir, Alexander, who would dare to humiliate her like this? Who would dare to speak to her in such a manner in Dampston?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne actually asked her to jump into the sea by herself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Lauren actually had no way out. Looking at Yohan's miserable and horrible face, she couldn't help but tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want to become like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Osborne was about to finish the countdown, Lauren finally pulled Yohan up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I'll jump!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I will remember what happened today, and so the Paltrow family! Let's wait and see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she prepared to jump off the ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne's face turned offish. "You still dare to threaten me? Well, now I have changed my mind. How about you receive a blow from me as well?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saying that, Osborne quickly slapped Lauren on the chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her breasts were flattened by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She spit out blood and jumped into the sea from the fifteenth floor of the Alisa Ship.</span></p></div>
