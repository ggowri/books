        <h1>Chapter 604 Defeating Aresta</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne spoke, he began to unleash his power, and the crowd immediately sensed his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone quickly realized that he was only at Class A+!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Augustine family, who had already lost hope, became even more despondent upon learning this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for Godfather still sitting there, they might have left early out of sheer despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Rosenthal family couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes were filled with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all this time, I thought they might have some hidden ace up their sleeve, but it's just someone at Class A+? In front of Aresta, he doesn't stand a chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aresta will crush him in an instant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He won't be able to withstand Aresta's attack at all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Rosenthal family members were utterly relaxed, confident that this fight was about to come to a swift conclusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Aresta made his move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've grown tired of waiting. Let me finish you quickly and end this pointless contest. The Augustine family is doomed to lose!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he finished speaking, Aresta's fist, with terrifying power, shot toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne remained calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had watched all the previous battles from his time in the dungeon. He had seen how Aresta had easily broken Sam's arm and defeated him with a single blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that Aresta's power was incredibly fearsome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's strength was considerable. Even without transforming into a Vampire, he was no weaker than Sam. However, compared to Aresta, there was still a gap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew he couldn't take Aresta's attack head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold snort, he summoned his martial art aura, which swirled around him, forming a vortex in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thunderous crash, Aresta's attack slammed into the vortex that Osborne had created. The immense force caused the vortex to ripple and churn, but it ultimately held firm, blocking Aresta's assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aresta, who had previously suffered severe injuries, had not yet fully recovered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His power was much weaker than at his peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most critical factor was that Osborne had used Stretch Soft Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stretch Soft Force had absorbed much of Aresta's strength, leaving the remaining force unable to shake Osborne, let alone harm him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne spoke softly, "So this is all the strength you have left? That makes things easier."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing his words, Aresta's expression changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stretch Soft Force? You've mastered it to such a proficiency level? Impressive! But if you think this will defend against all my attacks, you're dreaming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Aresta launched another attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, "Who said I'll only defend? If it's a fight you want, then I'll fight you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then threw a punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clash of their powers created a massive explosion, and both men were forced to step back simultaneously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted in chaos!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene that unfolded left everyone in shock, finding it hard to believe what they had just witnessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family, who had been drowning in despair, saw Osborne first block Aresta's attack and then hold his ground in a direct confrontation. Their spirits soared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He wasn't beaten instantly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We still have hope!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family members were overjoyed, while the Rosenthal family members frowned deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible? He is only at Class A+, yet he's so strong. He can stand his ground against Aresta. Even though Aresta isn't at his peak, this is still incredible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aresta, too, hadn't expected Osborne's strength to rival his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face darkened, but without hesitation, he attacked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne met him head-on without fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of their clashes filled the air, neither holding anything back. They attacked with raw power, each attempting to overpower the other. Aresta had defeated Lance in this same manner before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, Aresta realized something was wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's physical strength was no weaker than his own, and now Osborne was imitating Lance, enhancing his punches with mind control. This made his attacks even more formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Osborne's mind control wasn't as strong as Lance's, it was still enough to boost his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the direct confrontation, Osborne quickly gained the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aresta found himself being pushed back, his injuries worsening with each blow. Blood trickled from the corner of his mouth, and his face grew pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a final, explosive impact, Aresta's defenses crumbled as Osborne's fist struck his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aresta spat blood as he fell to the ground, struggling several times to stand but failing </span><span>each time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted in anger, "Damn it! If I hadn't been injured, how could I have lost to you?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "A loss is a loss. Stop making excuses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's next?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Aresta's face grew even darker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold snort, he spat, "So what if you've defeated an injured me? The Augustine family is still going to lose! You're just at Class A+, and we have three at Class AA Godsons. You're doomed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Aresta was carried away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family members, seeing this, erupted into cheers. Everyone looked at Osborne with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, they had thought that the Augustine family was finished and that they were bound to lose this bet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had even </span><span>thought</span><span> Osborne wouldn't survive Aresta's first punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Osborne had defeated Aresta!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Osborne appeared unscathed, still in peak condition!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have a chance to win!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We really have a chance now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family members were thrilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a figure stepped forward to face Osborne, sneering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got some skill. I didn't expect you to beat Aresta! But unfortunately, your luck ends here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember my name. I'm Sene Rosenthal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm the eleventh-ranked Godson of </span><span>Yalynch</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Sene finished speaking, the previously elated Augustine family members were stunned, their faces filled with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His rank is higher than Aresta's?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're finished!"</span></p></div>
