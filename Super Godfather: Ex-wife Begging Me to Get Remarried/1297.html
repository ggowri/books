        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a cold laugh. "So, you finally couldn't hold back anymore?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that's the case, Blood Demon members, listen up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the Blood Demon members sprang into action. Faced with twenty-nine Transcendent Deities and fifteen Superior Deities, they showed no fear&mdash;only excitement and eagerness for battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over four thousand Blood Demon warriors roared in unison, their divine power surging forth and merging seamlessly into a colossal shield of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the warriors of the Deschanel Clan unleashed their assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the power of Transcendent Deities at work, their divine power far surpassing that of Intermediate and Junior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under normal circumstances, even the residual energy from such an attack would severely injure or even kill Intermediate and Junior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with twenty-nine Transcendent Deities attacking together, the force was terrifying&mdash;like the sky collapsing or the sun plummeting from the heavens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a scene straight out of an apocalypse, a force capable of sweeping away anything in its path!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Deschanel Clan momentarily forgot their fear; their faces flushed with excitement as they watched their elders and clan leader unleash their might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the next second, they were left dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To their shock, the overwhelming attack was completely blocked by the Blood Demon members!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The combined strength of over four thousand warriors formed an immense divine power shield, absorbing the devastating onslaught without faltering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shield vibrated violently, on the verge of collapse, yet it held firm. The immense power of the attack was evenly distributed among the Blood Demon members, who remained unscathed and steadfast in their formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the attack dissipated, the Blood Demon warriors stood their ground, unyielding and resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this even possible?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence's eyes nearly popped out of his head as he stared in disbelief at the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were Transcendent Deity warriors!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A casual strike from them could wipe out a large group of Junior and Intermediate Deities. With twenty-nine Transcendent Deities and fifteen Superior Deities joining forces, Terrence had expected them to take down at least a few hundred Blood Demon members, if not more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surely, they should have been able to injure dozens!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the reality was that their attack had been perfectly countered by the Blood Demon members!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason for this astonishing outcome was the incredible synergy among the Blood Demon warriors. Each member, while unable to withstand such an attack alone, had come together in perfect harmony. Even with their numbers, a lack of coordination could have led to a breach in their defenses and significant casualties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, their teamwork was flawless. The nearly five thousand warriors' powers fused together to withstand the assault, leaving no openings for the enemy to exploit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne couldn't help but be impressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't anticipated that the Blood Demon members had honed their coordination to such an extent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems the Blood Demon members haven't been idle during this time. With such a level of synergy and cooperation, I'd feel at a loss facing them myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne chuckled, a smirk creeping across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You lot haven't been eating well, have you? With such pathetic strength, you dare to claim you can wipe out the Augustine family? You call yourselves elephants, and them ants? Ha! I'd say you're more like worms!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's derision instantly darkened the expressions of Terrence and the other warriors from the Deschanel Clan, igniting their fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence said, "Damn it! There's something off about them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their coordination is too perfect. Pour more power into your attacks! We need to crack their defense! Once we break through, their formation will fall apart. And when that happens, their numbers won't mean a thing. With our strength, we'll be able to wipe them out easily! Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence and his group launched another assault, this time with even more terrifying force. The twenty-nine Transcendent Deity warriors of the Deschanel Clan were now pulling out all the stops, unleashing their most potent techniques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onslaught was apocalyptic, like a celestial disaster, crashing down upon the Blood Demon members with relentless fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the Blood Demon warriors showed no sign of panic. Their divine power coalesced once more, forming an impenetrable shield of collective strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Individually, their divine power wasn't as potent as that of the Deschanel Clan's Transcendent and Superior Deities. But with nearly five thousand of them working together, their combined force more than compensated for any individual weakness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this time, Terrence and his group were attacking with everything they had. A barrage of devastating blows rained down, and eventually, the relentless assault began to take its toll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon's defensive shield, formidable as it was, finally cracked in one spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, hundreds of Blood Demon members were caught in the blast. Cracks appeared on their Divine Bodies, and for the first time, they sustained injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deschanel Clan members were thrilled by this turn of events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their defense isn't invincible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're hurt!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wipe them out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Excitement surged through the Deschanel Clan warriors. But their elation quickly turned to shock and horror.</span></p></div>
