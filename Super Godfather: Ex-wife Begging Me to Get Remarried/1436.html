        <h1>Chapter 1435 Ensnared</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The panic in the crowd was palpable as the realization hit them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faces turned pale, and one by one, they fumbled for their communication devices, desperate to reach the outside world. But their attempts were futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched them with a cold smile, making no move to stop their frantic efforts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their devices, far superior to any phone from Blue Planet, were designed to function in even the harshest environments, almost like divine artifacts capable of summoning help from anywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately for them, they were trapped within Osborne's Spatial Domain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This Level Six Spatial Domain was intangible and profound, transforming their surroundings into an entirely different realm where all communication devices were rendered useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if they were on Blue Planet, trying and failing to contact someone from Celestara&mdash;two worlds separated by an insurmountable divide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless they could break through the barriers of these distinct spaces, they would remain cut off from one another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And breaking Osborne's Level Six pinnacle Spatial Domain? Not even a combined effort from this group could achieve that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not even a Celestial Deity could manage it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only a Deity Overlord Warrior with divine power far exceeding Osborne's might stand a chance of forcibly breaking through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But these people were neither Deity Overlords nor even Celestial Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aside from the already injured Jeffrey and Elroy, they had only four Transcendent Deities among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest were merely Superior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To them, Osborne's Spatial Domain was an unyielding prison. Even if he did nothing and allowed them to attack, they couldn't hope to chip away at his defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were already doomed; they just didn't know it yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, "Did you really think I'd come unprepared? None of you so-called 'noble' races are leaving this place unscathed today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd exchanged worried glances, their expressions shifting from defiance to fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want from us, Lachlan? We don't know what trick you pulled to cut off our communication, but do you really think you're invincible? We're a united front, and you can't take us all on!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you think you can handle us together, if we split up, you won't catch any of us. If just one of us escapes, it's game over for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's smile widened. "Escape? You really think you can get away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces fell, dread creeping in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a sudden burst of determination, one of them charged off into the distance. Osborne merely watched, making no move to pursue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man slammed into an invisible barrier, bouncing back in shock. He didn't hesitate, immediately unleashing his divine power in a desperate attempt to shatter the unseen wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was all in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The barrier was utterly indestructible; no amount of effort could even rattle it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this... Realm?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why can't I sense any Realm fluctuations? Is this really a Level Six Realm?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shock rippled through the group as they processed the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne laughed, a sound rich with triumph. "Congratulations, you got it right!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is my Level Six Spatial Domain, and it's at its pinnacle! With your pathetic abilities, give yourselves a hundred years, and you still won't break through."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne finished speaking, the crowd stared at him, eyes wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Level Six pinnacle Realm? A Spatial Domain? No way! Lachlan only had Thunder Power! You're not Lachlan! You're an imposter! Who the hell are you?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled again, "Figured it out, did you? Too bad it's too late! Now, let's not waste any more time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he prepared to make his move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you dare! No matter who you are, if you try to kill us, you're as good as dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted in shouts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, saying, "Who said I was going to kill you? Keeping you alive is far more useful than ending your lives! From now on, you'll be my loyal subordinates!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flick of his wrist, a terrifying surge of spatial power erupted around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It swirled like a prison, instantly binding everyone here. Superior Deities and Transcendent Deities alike found themselves utterly immobilized, unable to so much as twitch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Osborne's Spatial Domain, where he reigned supreme. Here, his spatial power was magnified, rendering his captives helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group, even with their Transcendent Deities, stood no chance against the overwhelming force he commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every single one of them was ensnared, including Jeffrey, Elroy, and nearly a hundred members of the Wild Flame Army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear shone in their eyes, but their bodies remained frozen, unable to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured, "Welcome to your new fate&mdash;now you'll all become my Blood Clan progeny!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a drop of blood shot forth from his body, bursting into a dazzling spray that transformed into nearly a hundred beams of crimson light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These lights surged into the bodies of the trapped individuals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was forcibly converting them into Blood Clan members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With his current power, he no longer needed their consent; he could transform them all against their will.</span></p></div>
