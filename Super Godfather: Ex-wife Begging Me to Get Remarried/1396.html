        <h1>Chapter 1395 Rapid Recovery</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the last Intermediate Deity </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> defeated, an eerie silence enveloped the cavern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia collapsed to the ground, utterly exhausted. Vance and his five companions, along with over thirty </span><span>Deathborns</span><span>, lay lifeless around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The siblings exchanged a glance, and in each other's eyes, they saw the relief of having survived a harrowing ordeal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had won!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Against all odds, they had made it through this perilous situation and emerged as the last ones standing. It felt like a miracle&mdash;almost too good to be true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry murmured, "When did our luck turn around like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought we were always the unluckiest ones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, I still can't wrap my head around why those </span><span>Deathborns</span><span> suddenly stopped attacking us. Do you think it's really our father's spirit watching over us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, she thought, "Is it really just luck?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I don't buy it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm starting to believe someone has been helping us from the shadows, but we just haven't found the proof yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, her eyes narrowed as she noticed something astonishing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the Intermediate Deity </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> was slain, the high-grade death scent it left behind began to vanish rapidly, as if being absorbed by something unseen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia mused, "How is this possible? I've heard that even a Level Five Divine Body can't withstand the high-grade death scent; it would be easily corroded. What on earth is absorbing it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's mind raced with questions, but she kept her thoughts to herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she scanned the area, she realized that the high-grade death scent left by the thirty-plus </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> was now completely gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's really going on here? Who's helping us from the shadows?" she wondered, biting her lip in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne was brimming with excitement. After the Intermediate Deity </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> fell, the high-grade death scent it left behind was far superior to that of the Junior Deity </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity began to absorb the high-grade death scent, and its roots surged with renewed vitality, quickly mending Osborne's injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he felt his strength returning, Osborne couldn't help but let out a joyful sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured, "Finally, I'm feeling better!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it's still not enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right now, my power barely compares to a thousandth of what it was at my peak&mdash;just enough to match an ordinary Intermediate Deity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Taking on a regular Intermediate Deity would still be a challenge! But against the </span><span>Intermediate Deity </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>? I should be fine! That means I can hunt more </span><span>Deathborns</span><span> and speed up the recovery of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne grew impatient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at Harry and Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> within a twelve-mile radius have already been drawn to me. They should be safe for a while. I can leave them behind and venture deeper into the mine to regain my strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having made up his mind, Osborne set off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only with sufficient power could he survive in </span><span>Celestara</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had heard Vance's final threat: Patrick was Vance's sister's husband, and after Vance's death, Patrick would undoubtedly come looking for answers. It was very likely he would track down Harry and Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When that day came, it would spell a much greater crisis!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Patrick is a Superior Deity and part of the Ninth Dark Deity Legion's reserves. This could get messy. I need to recover my strength quickly if I'm going to deal with him!" Osborne thought as he plunged deeper into the mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Here, he found an even greater abundance of Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne already had over 50 thousand low-grade Essence Crystals in his Dimensional Space, and until his injuries healed, those low-grade crystals were of no use to him. He didn't want to waste time collecting more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were mid-grade or top-grade Essence Crystals, then he definitely couldn't miss out on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, Osborne ignored the numerous Essence Crystals around him and headed straight for the deeper parts of the mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If his actions were known to others, they would probably scold him for being so extravagant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was extremely difficult for others to obtain Essence Crystals, yet Osborne turned a blind eye to them, even if they were right at his fingertips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this manner, Osborne quickly reached a point hundred miles deep into the mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Here, he finally picked up the trail of the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When not in action, the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> existed in a completely soul-like state, fully integrated with their surroundings. Even with his Satan's Eye, Osborne found it difficult to detect them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at this moment, he finally spotted an Intermediate Deity </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is it! Today, I must kill at least ten Intermediate Deity </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> and use their high-grade death scent to restore the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this thought, Osborne immediately made his move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly after, Osborne successfully eliminated the Intermediate Deity </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>. After absorbing the high-grade death scent, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity recovered significantly, and Osborne's injuries also healed somewhat, making him even stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued to search for and swiftly slaughter Intermediate Deity </span><span>Deathborns</span><span>, acquiring their high-grade death scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he had killed five of them, reaping a huge reward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he was preparing to search for the next one, his eyes suddenly lit up.</span></p></div>
