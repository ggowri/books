        <h1>Chapter 399 Passionate Kiss</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, Osborne was right to insist on coming to Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Isa had told Osborne to rely more on himself, when Osborne came to her for help, she didn't refuse for the most part.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now the energy in the Bronze Mirror was removed by Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Osborne and Isaac had tried and failed to do was as simple as eating or drinking water to Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hurriedly took the Bronze Mirror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, Osborne felt an additional connection between him and the Bronze Mirror, and he could finally trigger the energy in the Bronze Mirror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what can it be used for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ancient magic weapons were not all weapons, and there were all sorts of them with different effects. Osborne researched them and realized that he couldn't figure them out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power in the Bronze Mirror could be triggered, but those energies didn't seem to be used for attack or defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa looked at Osborne as if she were looking at an idiot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She grabbed the Bronze Mirror and said lightly, "I'll give you that. I've helped you with it, but you still don't know how to use it. It's like I've helped you prepare a meal, but you don't know how to enjoy it. Do you want me to feed you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about I hold your hand and teach you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rubbed his nose awkwardly when Isa finished speaking, but he wasn't offended. He knew Isa didn't hate him, and she just took the opportunity to taunt him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "Let her taunt me. I truly don't know anything about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Osborne didn't retort, Isa instantly grinned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, the ancient magic weapon isn't a weapon or a physical defense, it's a soul armor that can withstand psychic force attacks!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, the Bronze Mirror was activated by Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint light suddenly surged out and enveloped Isa's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Satan's Eye has reached level five, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can use the Illusion Projection now. Illusion Projection is a mental attack, and you can try using it on me now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised his eyebrows at once when Isa finished speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he going to use the Illusion Projection on Isa?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never failed an illusion he projected with Satan's Eye. Even a Class A martial master like Brad would be affected when he got the Illusion Projection into his brain by Osborne, at least he would freeze in place for a split second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was the Bronze Mirror a soul armor?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it withstand the Illusion Projection?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne thought about it, he decided to give it a try. He was wondering what scene he should project to Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne had an idea, and a teasing grin appeared on his face. He decided to project an interesting scene to Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Isa, how dare you taunt me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'll just project the image of me forcibly kissing you back then as an illusion. If the Bronze Mirror really can resist the illusion, you won't definitely know what I've projected to you. If it can't resist it, you'll be embarrassed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne instantly began to do so after he thought about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he turned on Satan's Eye, he instantly projected the image of him pressing Isa against the wall and kissing her forcibly a month ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Osborne looked at Isa seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa looked indifferent and had no idea what Osborne was thinking. She didn't care in the slightest when confronted with Osborne's Illusion Projection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But, soon after, she looked momentarily surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face flushed quickly. She glared at Osborne, biting her lips tightly as she looked incomparably angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard, do you want to die?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you project such an image to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a sudden loud noise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne was kicked out by Isa, and he couldn't help but let out a scream. Fortunately, Isa's control of power was at its peak, and he was only kicked off without being injured, so he quickly stabilized his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa blushed. She glared at Osborne and seemed to want to hit him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hurriedly explained, "Don't hit me! You said that the Bronze Mirror could resist my Illusion Projection. How could I have known that you would see the illusion?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa gritted her teeth and said, "Asshole! I said it could resist mental attack! But it's broken, and it can't completely resist it, only ninety percent of it. So, although your Illusion Projection can't affect my mind, I can see the contents of the illusion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Isa's face got even flushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The illusion that Osborne projected to Isa was the image of her being pressed against the wall and kissed forcibly. Isa was so familiar with that image, and she could even feel what she was feeling at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because it was her first kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had almost forgotten about it, but Osborne used the illusion to bring it back to her, and Osborne's illusion was on a loop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now as long as Isa closed her eyes, the image of Osborne pressing her against the wall and kissing her would appear in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could remember the warm sensation of Osborne's lips touching hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tongue was wet and smooth in her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the image was so clear and vivid in Isa's mind that she couldn't clear it no matter what.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's neck was completely red at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew he had made a mistake and didn't dare say anything. He rushed towards the door, wanting to get out of here before he was blamed by Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, his reaction was too slow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No sooner had he rushed out of the room than Isa grabbed him by the collar and yanked him back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body was pressed against the wall by Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's eyes were now filled with tears, her face, neck and ears were now blushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she stared at Osborne and said indifferently, "Bastard, how dare you forcibly kiss me back then? When have I ever suffered such a big loss?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So now I'm going to kiss it back forcibly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Isa suddenly leaned over and bit Osborne's lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened at once.</span></p></div>
