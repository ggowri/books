        <h1>Chapter 866 The Powerful Marlon</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since you want a fight, I'll gladly oblige! Let's see if you, Marlon, have what it takes to break into the top ten of the Godson Rankings!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Wesson unleashed his power.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The terrifying force of a Class S warrior surged forth, bearing down on Marlon like a storm. Yet Marlon remained unfazed, his demeanor as calm as a summer breeze.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wesson's expression shifted to one of grave concern.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just this display of power alone suggested that Marlon was more than capable of entering the top twenty of the Godson Rankings. Coupled with a divine artifact, he could pose a real threat.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's do this!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, Wesson and Marlon clashed, their energies colliding with a force that sent shockwaves through the Augustine Estate. Everyone turned their heads toward Mount Celestial Reach, puzzled by the sudden turbulence.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Mount Celestial Reach was a forbidden zone, and the average member of the Augustine family was strictly prohibited from approaching.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The fierce battle between Wesson and Marlon lasted barely five minutes. After an intense exchange, they broke apart. Wesson's face was cold and resolute, while Marlon wore a faint, arrogant smile.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you for the lesson, Mr. Wesson Augustine. We won't take up any more of your time," Marlon said with a slight bow before vanishing with his companions.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Footsteps echoed as Declan, Bob, and Caleb from the main bloodline of the Augustine family rushed in.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They were the only three elders permitted to approach Mount Celestial Reach.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Wesson Augustine, what on earth just happened? We sensed a massive disturbance in this area!" Declan exclaimed, urgency in his voice.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wesson's expression remained grim, and he didn't respond immediately.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, he coughed up a mouthful of blood, his face paling dramatically.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The three elders' eyes widened in alarm.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Wesson Augustine, you're injured?!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After spitting out the blood, Wesson felt a wave of relief wash over him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He waved dismissively at the three. "I'm fine&mdash;just a minor injury!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Marlon is incredibly powerful! He's definitely earned his place among the top ten in the Godson Rankings!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm getting old..."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His worry deepened.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The fact that Marlon, a Class AAA, had managed to injure him was alarming. Though Wesson had also hurt Marlon, it was evident that Marlon had the potential to break into the upper echelons of the rankings.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The strongest of the younger generation isn't Cuthbert; it's Marlon!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"His strength far surpasses Cuthbert's!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wesson's brow furrowed in concern.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What? Marlon?" Declan's face turned serious. "The Marlon from the Thornberry family? What's he doing here, and why was he fighting you?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a moment's hesitation, Wesson decided to fill them in on the arrival of Rumen and the others, ensuring they were prepared for what lay ahead.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once he finished, the three elders went pale.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The League of Divine Descent wants us to hand over seventy percent of our rare metals? This is outright robbery! How dare they?" Bob exclaimed, anger boiling in his voice.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What about the Godfather? He wouldn't agree to this!" Caleb added, his fists clenched.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn the League of Divine Descent! Do they think the Augustine family is easy prey?" Declan fumed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wesson raised a hand to quiet them.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now isn't the time for outrage. You can't make decisions on this, and neither can I. I need to contact the Godfather immediately."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A shadow of worry crossed Wesson's face.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought to himself, "I've been trying to reach the Godfather every day, but I can't get through!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What will we do if he doesn't return in time?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once the Honor Quest Ceremony is over, the League will come knocking. Am I really going to have to accept their terms and hand over seventy percent of the Draco Group's rare metals?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why should we just give it away?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wesson clenched his fists, determination etched on his face. "Leave this to me. Just focus on making the Honor Quest Ceremony a success! By the way, how's Osborne doing?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other three exchanged glances and then shook their heads.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne seems to be in seclusion. We have no idea where he is."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wesson furrowed his brow, concern flickering across his features.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I trust he'll emerge before the Honor Quest Ceremony. I just hope he doesn't let us down."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, he turned and walked away, the weight of the situation heavy on his shoulders.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The trio stood in silence, their expressions grave. The looming Honor Quest Ceremony and the threat from the League of Divine Descent cast a shadow over them, a sense of impending storm brewing in the air.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, at the Challenge Peak, in the fighting arena, Clarissa suddenly coughed up blood, her face going pale.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Submit!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her opponent exuded an overwhelming presence. With a casual strike, she shattered Clarissa's defenses.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a thud, Clarissa hit the ground outside the ring, a look of despair etched on her features.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa had lost, not from exhaustion, but because her opponent was simply too powerful.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her opponent taunted, "Ha! Is this the best the Fatebearer can muster?! You're hardly worth the effort!"</p></div>
