        <h1>Chapter 65 Pick a Few More</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Osborne?&rdquo; Ophelia exclaimed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She never expected to see him here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Moreover, he was with Alison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison was the general manager of Luna Jewelry, which was the Caldwell Group&rsquo;s biggest competitor in Mayby City. Why was Osborne with her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">How did they know each other?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Most importantly, Alison opened the car door for Osborne. What on earth was going on?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A line appeared between Ophelia&rsquo;s brows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley ignored Osborne and stared at Alison closely. Watching Alison&rsquo;s confident expression and beautiful face, he repressed his desire, and a hint of jealousy flashed through his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Few people knew that the perfect wife in Wesley&rsquo;s mind was Alison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He once pursued Alison madly, but unfortunately, Alison didn&rsquo;t accept him. He was even beaten out by Alison&rsquo;s bodyguards once.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Later, he shifted his goal and decided to marry Ophelia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He still wanted to have sex with Alison. That was why he did not sell the uncut diamonds to Luna Jewelry. He wanted to force her to cave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Once Alison came to him and begged, he could do whatever he wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But what was happening now? Why was Alison with Osborne?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley was fumed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Why are you here? I remember you were still a loser the last time I saw you. You&rsquo;re everywhere. Why?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley tried to provoke Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But before Osborne could retore, Alison&rsquo;s expression shifted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You want to pick a fight, Wesley?&rdquo; she shouted. Everyone could hear the fury in her tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, a group of bodyguards came up to her and fixed their gazes at Wesley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It took Wesley a few seconds to realized what was going on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He never expected that Alison would react like this. All he said was just some provocative words, and they acted like they were about to tear him apart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Why did she do that? What was their relationship?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley&rsquo;s face was gloomy. The Ashford family owned this diamond dealing market, and his family hired a large number of security personnel. Naturally, he was not afraid of Alison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He snorted coldly. &ldquo;Alison, you weren&rsquo;t fooled by this loser, were you? What does he have apart from his decent looks?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Anger flashed in Alison&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was her boss. Though they didn&rsquo;t know each other that well, she wouldn&rsquo;t allow others to humiliate someone she respected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She waved her hand and wanted the bodyguard to teach Wesley how to speak nicely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, just at this time, Osborne held her shoulders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then he said in a faint smile, &ldquo;Wesley, you seem a little envious. Why? Are you jealous of Alison and me walking together? Do you care about Ophelia at all?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You will be getting married soon.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His words helped Wesley gain his consciousness. His heart sank, and he turned to look at Ophelia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia&rsquo;s expression was thick on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t listen to what he says, honey. I just don&rsquo;t like him. It has nothing to do with Alison. Otherwise, why would I stop supplying Luna Jewelry? I did it for you because I love you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia&rsquo;s mood lifted a bit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She looked at Osborne and smirked. &ldquo;Osborne, I didn&rsquo;t know you were so popular with women. You just came out from the Radcliffe Manor and already kissing Alison&rsquo;s boots.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You know that Alison is my competitor, right? Are you flattering her just to piss me off? If so, then you are too naive.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne sneered. &ldquo;Does my popularity with women or who I flatter have anything to do with you? If you think that is what I&rsquo;m up to, then please continue. I don&rsquo;t care what you think. Just don&rsquo;t burn in anger.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After saying that, Osborne withdrew his gaze, not wanting to argue more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get inside, Mr&hellip; Osborne.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison opened her mouth and almost called him Mr. Augustine but reacted in time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The two prepared to go in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley stopped them again and asked, as if he really cared, &ldquo;Alison, you didn&rsquo;t come here to try your luck with uncut diamonds, right?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison looked at him with contempt. &ldquo;Wesley, can you just stop? Of course, I came here to try my luck. Or why would I come to this shit hole?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley&rsquo;s expression froze on his face, anger exploding in his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He retorted, &ldquo;So that means Luna Jewelry will not be able to hold on without my diamond supply? That is good to know. Welcome. I hope you can find the best diamonds.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley smiled cruelly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He knew the diamond dealing market better than anyone else. People got ripped off all the time, bringing his family hundreds of millions of dollars every year.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The probability of finding natural top-notch diamonds was too small.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Ashford family had already picked the pure ones. The raw ones there were small.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Or contained too much impurity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As for Luna Jewelry, which was engaged in the high-end jewelry customization business, it was useless to find diamonds there. They had to find the finest stones to make their business go smoothly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley didn&rsquo;t believe Alison could find what she was after.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;OK, then. Remember to pick a few more,&rdquo; Wesley chuckled and went in with Ophelia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison&rsquo;s face looked grim. She said with a frown, &ldquo;Wesley was disrespectful to you, Mr. Augustine. Do you want me to do something about it?&rdquo;</p></div>
