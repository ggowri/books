        <h1>Chapter 404 Snatch</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five minutes ago, in a room on the Voyager cruise ship. More than a dozen figures were gathering together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, let's move now!" a young man said eagerly. "You've all seen those jewels. They're all top-notch. The Mighty Scepter and the Holy Crown are absolutely priceless and would fetch an astronomical price at auction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We must act now, or it'll be too late! If we pull off this heist, we'll never want for money again! We'll leave the pirate life behind and live in the lap of luxury anywhere in the world."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face flushed with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A short while ago, all the jewels up for auction were displayed on the Voyager cruise ship. They had all gone to see, and every single one of them had been blown away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All were top-notch jewelry worth hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions, or even over 100 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The final two pieces, the Mighty Scepter and the Holy Crown, especially dazzled them. The diamond as big as a baby's fist took away all their sanity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wanted them, and they were ready to snatch them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As pirates, snatching was their trade. They had been thrilled when they heard there would be a grand auction on the high seas featuring numerous top-tier jewels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had spent a fortune buying over a dozen tickets, boarding the Voyager cruise ship, and waiting for the perfect moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, their chance had come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the jewels were to be transferred from the Voyager cruise ship to the Alisa Ship, and this was the prime opportunity to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the jewels were guarded by forty of the Draco Group's best, they felt no fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as they nabbed the jewels and disappeared into the vast ocean, even the Draco Group couldn't catch them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, everyone watched the pirate leader with bated breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a man in a black hooded sweatshirt, his face obscured by the hood, leaving only his lips visible and he sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. We'll make our move," the leader finally said, his voice icy. "The reason I brought you here is to steal those jewels. But you need to understand that our opponents are the Draco Group, the kingpins of Rosmandi's underworld, the henchmen of the Godfather. If we go up against them, even if we succeed, we'll be on the Draco Group's most-wanted list."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, we're not scared!" The young man who had spoken first was still fired up. "Who cares about the Draco Group? They rule the Rosmandi's underworld, not the world's. At worst, we just never set foot in Rosmandi again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly, we're not afraid!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's do it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader smiled at their words, but inside, he was contemptuous. "What a bunch of hot-headed, gullible fools. But since you're all eager for action, you can't blame me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then spoke aloud. "Alright, everyone, get ready to move! We'll strike once all the jewels are loaded onto the small boat. Kill all the Draco Group's security and take the boat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the leader's command, the dozen men grew excited, itching for action. They all dreamed of the good life that awaited them after a successful heist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, they didn't notice the disdain and sneer in the leader's eyes. He thought, "Poor saps. Your only purpose is to use your lives to distract the Draco Group, drawing away their security forces to facilitate the raid by the Aberrants."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, they made their move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silently, they knocked out several security guards on the Voyager cruise ship and made their way to the deck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, all the jewels had just been loaded onto the small boat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Move!" The leader in black didn't hesitate. With a wave of his hand, a terrifying force erupted, causing waves within a 1640-foot radius and as high as 50 feet to surge, engulfing the six small boats of the special operation team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, the boats were specially modified and quickly resurfaced, but the waves threw the special operation team members into the water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, the pirates grew wildly excited and launched their attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take the jewel-laden boat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pirates leaped from the deck of the Voyager cruise ship onto the small boat, fiercely assaulting the special operation team members who were now in the water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The special operation team seemed stunned by the sudden attack. They were strong, but the pirates were no pushovers and held the advantage. Soon, casualties mounted, and the sea turned red with blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, the pirate leader slowly descended. He landed on the boat carrying the jewels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With another wave of his hand, waves formed behind the boat, propelling it away at high speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, the special operation team panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simultaneously, security personnel on 22 nearby cruise ships received the alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enemy attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The jewels have been stolen!"</span></p></div>
