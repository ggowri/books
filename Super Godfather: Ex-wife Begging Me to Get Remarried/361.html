        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Evan and I killed Allen, the head of the Augustine family," said Webster without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne discovered that the expression of one of the other three suddenly became terrible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, he was Evan, whom Webster had mentioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, Osborne asked Webster a few more questions. Under the effect of the truth serum, Webster told everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the effect of the truth serum was about to wear off, Osborne finally asked his last question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Has the Paltrow family colluded with The Aberrants?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Webster still did not hesitate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Aberrants once sent people to contact the head of our family and Alexander. But I don't know what they talked about. I am just an elder in The Wise Order. I cannot participate in the core decision-making."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne turned serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fifth heir trial the Godfather set up for him was divided into three parts. The third part required him to find all the ancient families in Dampston that were in collusion with The Aberrants and kill all their leaders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, it seemed that the Paltrow family was likely colluding with The Aberrants!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Webster was not important enough. He could not confirm the specific situation. The only thing he knew was that The Aberrants had indeed contacted the Paltrow family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face turned colder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "If the Paltrow family is really colluding with The Aberrants, according to the content of my heir trial, I have to kill all the Paltrow family leaders!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It is so challenging!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were definitely more than two Class A masters in the Paltrow family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Alexander was striving to become a Class A master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Osborne's current strength, he might be secretly killed by the Paltrow family, let alone killing all the Paltrow family's leaders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the truth serum effect wore off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Webster was extremely pale. He stared at Osborne with gritted teeth, angrily saying, "Damn bastard, what did you do to me? Why did I say those words? Those were not true!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled coldly and ignored him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked up to the second person and started to ask questions in the same way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This person was Evan Walker from the Walker family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a mind control metahuman. The Walker family's inherited power was indeed the mind control. From Evan, Osborne confirmed Webster's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan told Osborne that The Aberrants had also contacted the Walker family, but he didn't know whether the Walker family had colluded with The Aberrants either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also admitted that he had participated in the attack that had killed Allen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Osborne came to the third person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was Hugh Luther from the Luther family. The Luther family's inherited power was the ice elemental power. The Luther family had also had contact with The Aberrants. Hugh told Osborne with certainty that the Luther family had agreed to the conditions of The Aberrants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he didn't know what The Aberrants was going to do with the Luther family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, the Luther family was indeed in collusion with The Aberrants!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned extremely cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "The situation is quite serious! The top three ancient families in Dampston are all connected to and likely colluding with The Aberrants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What the hell does The Aberrants want to do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the requirements of the heir trial, wouldn't I have to kill all the leaders of these three ancient families? How is this possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a bit helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it had already happened, and he could only take it one step at a time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour later, Osborne had questioned all four of them and finally stopped after </span><span>confirming that he could not get any more helpful information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Osborne stared at Hugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hugh's power was the ice elemental power, which was an elemental power and a variant of the water elemental power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "I have already absorbed the water elemental essence. The ice elemental essence is a variation of the water elemental essence. Can I absorb the ice elemental essence?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't hesitate and decided to give it a try.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyway, it would lose nothing to give it a try. If Satan's Eye could devour the ice elemental essence, he would possess the eighth elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one in the history of the Augustine family had ever achieved possessing eight elemental essences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even possessing four was extremely rare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Satan's Eye stared at Hugh and instantly locked onto the ice elemental essence in his body. Osborne devoured it with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was pleasantly surprised that it actually worked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt that he had the power to control ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that moment, the ice elemental essence did not exist independently in Osborne's body but was integrated into his water elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His water elemental essence instantly became stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne opened his mouth and was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked a bit disappointed, but he soon calmed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "I don't get the eighth elemental essence. But my water elemental essence has become stronger, and so is my level five Devil's Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I actually gain something!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking about it, Osborne was about to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His harvest today was already huge enough. He wiped out the Ghost Ship and obtained a lot of helpful information, which finally made him no longer so passive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The complete collapse of the Ghost Ship was enough to make the three ancient families, the Paltrow family, the Walker family, and the Luther family, quiet for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the short term, they probably wouldn't target the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, it was time to help the Augustine family develop!</span></p></div>
