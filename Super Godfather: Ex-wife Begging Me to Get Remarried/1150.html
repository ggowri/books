        <h1>Chapter 1149 The Carey Family's Request for Help</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over 500 thousand Ferocious Beasts had been slaughtered, with a staggering 95% of them wiped out. The few that managed to escape were merely weaklings, no longer a threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew that the trouble posed by this Beast Tide had been effectively dealt with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire process had turned out to be far easier than he had anticipated, thanks in no small part to his skyrocketing power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, he also owed a debt of gratitude to Anastasia, Zoe, and the ever-reliable members of the Blood Demon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne absorbed all the blood energy within a thirty-mile radius into the Blood Cross, feeling the immense power swell inside. He glanced around at the devastated jungle, now a battlefield littered with the remnants of the fallen beasts, and a faint smile appeared on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The natural energy in the air was thick and vibrant, and despite the chaos, the jungle's resilience was undeniable. Though it looked as if it had been bombed multiple times, it wouldn't be long before this place transformed back into a lush, impenetrable forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time to head back!" Osborne announced, signaling the Blood Demon members to take a breather as he approached Cillian and the other three, ready to bring them along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't forgotten that the reason these four had braved the treacherous </span><span>Lostridge</span><span> Mountains was to seek help from the Augustine family in Newport City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he drew closer, he noticed the four of them hovering in mid-air, their expressions a mix of awe and admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being </span><span>roughly</span><span> the same age&mdash;if not younger&mdash;than the three of them, the trio's incredible strength had left a lasting impression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had just witnessed the annihilation of a Beast Tide that had numbered in the hundreds of thousands!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Particularly impressive was Osborne, who had single-handedly taken down over 200 thousand Ferocious Beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if a god had descended upon them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne approached, the four of them bowed respectfully once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved them off with a laugh. "Sorry to keep you waiting! This Beast Tide turned out to be a bit larger than expected. It took us just over three hours to wrap things up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, the four exchanged incredulous glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cillian couldn't help but exclaim, "Three hours to handle a 500 thousand-strong Beast Tide? That's unbelievable! In the past two months, over thirty cities in </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> have been attacked by Beast Tides, and only twice have they reached numbers over 500 thousand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those instances nearly destroyed half the cities and resulted in over a million casualties! It took countless people working together to finally drive them back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The thought of completely annihilating a Beast Tide was something we wouldn't </span><span>even dare to dream of! And today, we finally witnessed the true might of Godfather. Just the other day, we were all feeling pretty proud of ourselves for breaking into Class A. Now we realize how small we really are."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Cillian finished, the other three nodded vigorously in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, feeling a bit bashful at their praise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly shifted the topic. "Now, why don't you tell me about your mission to seek help from the Augustine family in Newport City? Since you've already ran into me here, so feel free to speak up. If I can help, I won't turn you down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cillian's eyes lit up at the invitation. "Godfather, it's like this..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly recounted their situation, and Osborne's expression shifted to one of surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure about this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely, Godfather! This is the real deal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne fell into deep thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cillian's request for help from the Augustine family was straightforward enough: a massive crack had suddenly opened up in a canyon behind the Carey Estate, and from that fissure had emerged a number of powerful Dark Exotic Beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, the number of Dark Exotic Beasts was manageable, and the Carey family could hold their ground. However, as their numbers surged, the Eidolon City hordes found themselves overwhelmed. They even rallied every wealthy and Ancient Family within the city to join the fray, but the tide was turning dangerously against them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beasts emerging from the rift grew not only in count but also in strength, many attaining Class AAA status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the combined might of Eidolon City's elites, </span><span>casualties mounted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inevitably, they turned to the illustrious Augustine family in Newport City for aid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They attempted to phone the Augustine family, but with the onslaught of pleas for help, the Augustine family was stretched thin, merely promising to prioritize the requests as best they could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owing to the proximity of the rift to their own estate, the Carey family couldn't afford to wait.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A further influx of Dark Exotic Beasts could quickly sweep through the valley, bringing immediate peril upon the Carey family and then the entirety of Eidolon City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eidolon City, while not vast, housed over a million civilians. If the Augustine family refused to intervene, those millions would be at grave risk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured, intrigued, "A sudden rift?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He added, "I'll join you to take a look. I've always been curious about the origins of these Dark Exotic Beasts. This might provide some answers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cillian and the others were elated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their hope had merely been to secure some skilled fighters from the Augustine family, but Osborne himself, the Godfather, was offering to go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing Osborne's might, they breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne instructed, "Head back with me to Augustine Estate first. I've got some things to handle. After that, we'll head to Eidolon City together."</span></p></div>
