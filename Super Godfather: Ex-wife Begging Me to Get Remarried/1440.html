        <h1>Chapter 1439 New Ability</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the sudden breakthrough of his Satan's Eye to Level Nine, Osborne felt an immediate change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The abilities he had previously wielded had grown exponentially stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, these enhancements were precisely what he had anticipated. What truly captivated his attention was the brand-new power unlocked by his Satan's Eye at this unprecedented level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This newfound ability materialized in his mind, leaving him momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The new power of Level Nine Satan's Eye&mdash;Infinite Devouring Eyes! Eyes capable of automatically absorbing any energy from the universe!" he murmured, his voice tinged with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, Osborne activated the newly acquired power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A colossal, ethereal eye appeared before him, an exact replica of his left eye, adorned with nine purple stars within its pupil. Its beauty was both enchanting and eerie, radiating an aura of immense power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as it manifested, it began to draw in energies from the surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simultaneously, Osborne felt an unending stream of pure energy surging into his body. This energy, remarkably refined, required little to no refinement and could be readily converted into his divine power, facilitating leaps in his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This energy flowed like a gentle brook, not overwhelming but ceaselessly replenishing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Infinite Devouring Eyes absorb various energies from the environment and transmute them into this pure, immediately usable power to enhance my cultivation?" Osborne marveled, his eyes alight with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He saw the Infinite Devouring Eyes even absorbing the pervasive scent of death that lingered in Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scent of death was a fearsome force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did ordinary cultivators rely on Essence Crystals for their training instead of directly harnessing the energies in the air? It was because of this deadly blend of scent and ambient energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Absorbing this scent of death could lead to the collapse and decay of one's Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne's formidable Divine Body, comparable to a Level Nine Cosmic Divine Body, dared not absorb this lethal blend directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, with its unparalleled resilience, could withstand the corrosive effects of the scent of death, even assimilating high-grade death scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, Osborne could do the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Level Nine Satan's Eye could summon Infinite Devouring Eyes, seamlessly absorbing any energy and converting it into divine power that propelled his ascension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In essence, once Osborne unleashed the Infinite Devouring Eyes, his strength and cultivation could soar without any further active engagement in training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who would have thought that achieving Level Nine with Satan's Eye would grant such an extraordinary ability?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Infinite Devouring Eyes, while not directly boosting my power, makes my journey of cultivation far easier, simpler, and quicker!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed at which these eyes absorb energy far surpasses my own efforts. With Infinite Devouring Eyes, I can accelerate my ascent even without the core energy of the Lotus," Osborne mused, his heart brimming with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, the Infinite Devouring Eyes seemed like an extension of his own being, a separate entity he could place in a secure location to ceaselessly absorb energy and further his cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked as he finalized his plan to place the Infinite Devouring Eyes in the No. 9 mining area. The depth of this locale, teeming with an abundance of Essence Crystals, was a treasure trove of rich spiritual energy. Positioning the Infinite Devouring Eyes here would allow them to rapidly absorb this energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furthermore, his spatial power would enable him to conceal these eyes within a parallel dimension, ensuring they remained imperceptible and devoid of risk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt that the capabilities of the Infinite Devouring Eyes went beyond mere energy consumption.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They held untapped potential waiting to be unlocked, possibly only when his Satan's Eye reached Level Ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With no hesitation, Osborne set into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had spent three arduous days elevating his Satan's Eye to Level Nine, though time acceleration had compressed this to a mere seven hours in the real world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With three more hours left before dawn, Osborne decided to make the most of this window&mdash;ensuring the Infinite Devouring Eyes were securely placed and scouting for top-grade Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Employing his Phantom Steps, Osborne swiftly navigated to the deepest part of the No. 9 mining area, an untouched region where the ambient energy was thick and potent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To others, this potent energy would be tainted by a death scent, rendering it unabsorbable. However, such nuances posed no challenge to the Infinite Devouring Eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Acting promptly, Osborne released the Infinite Devouring Eyes, embedding them within the parallel space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, the eyes sprang into action, voraciously devouring the surrounding energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This absorbed energy would then seep quietly into Osborne's body, continuously enhancing his strength and elevating his realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is gonna be epic!" Osborne exclaimed with palpable excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this rate, he reckoned it wouldn't be long before he ascended to the Transcendent Deity level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, the Infinite Devouring Eyes would grow more potent in parallel with his heightened abilities, their devouring capabilities intensifying accordingly.</span></p></div>
