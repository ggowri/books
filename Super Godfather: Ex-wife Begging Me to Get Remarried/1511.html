        <h1>Chapter 1510 Training With Top-Grade Essence Crystal</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren continued, "Currently, out of all the members of Spark of Blaze, only two hundred and fifty-five actually need Essence Crystals for cultivation. Even if everyone trains day and night, it's highly optimistic to expect that they could each consume 10 thousand mid-grade Essence Crystals per month. Mr. Lachlan Swift, this is indeed too much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled at the remark. "In fact, it's not excessive at all. The mid-grade Essence Crystals in these bags are not for your training purposes but for emergencies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You see, as a squad leader of the Wild Flame Army, I'm soon to be promoted to centurion. Consequently, I'll be frequently away on missions and won't always be here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"During my absences, other clans and powerful factions are bound to cause trouble. If the enemy's strength is overwhelming, you'll have to rely on these mid-grade Essence Crystals to activate the divine power shield for protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The crystals are specifically reserved for this purpose. With nearly a million mid-grade Essence Crystals, even multiple Deity Overlord warriors attacking the shield simultaneously could be stalled for an extended period, long enough for me to return."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty and Darren exchanged a glance upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They nodded in understanding. "So that's the rationale behind it! Mr. Lachlan Swift, you have indeed thought of everything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty then added, "However, I think the members should still use mid-grade Essence Crystals for training. The speed at which one can train with mid-grade compared to low-grade Essence Crystals is vastly different."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice carried a hint of pleading. "The quicker everyone improves, the stronger Spark of Blaze becomes, so..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but laugh, recognizing Betty's unintended misunderstanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He explained with a smile, "Why would they need to train with mid-grade Essence Crystals? I've already included 10 thousand top-grade Essence Crystals in the Dimensional Bag, which should suffice for a while, right? Given that we have top-grade Essence Crystals, why resort to mid-grade ones? You wouldn't think I'd have the members train with just low-grade crystals, would you? Ha! To be honest, I have plenty of mid-grade Essence Crystals, but not a single low-grade one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's revelation stunned Betty and Darren, their eyes widening in disbelief as they stared at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty exclaimed, her voice filled with astonishment, "There are 10 thousand top-grade Essence Crystals in the Dimensional Bag?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How on earth do you have top-grade Essence Crystals, Mr. Lachlan Swift?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you stumbled upon some ancient divine treasure trove?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In Wild Flame City, top-grade Essence Crystals are only within reach of the upper echelons living atop the floating mountain or the super-talented elites of dominant races."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren nodded in agreement. "Even in the East Zone, top-grade Essence Crystals are extremely rare. As a Deity Overlord warrior, I seldom had access to them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If our Spark of Blaze members, who are already highly talented, train with top-grade Essence Crystals, their growth rate will rival that of the super-talented elites of dominant races."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren sighed wistfully. "Sadly, my comrades' power essences have been destroyed, rendering them incapable of cultivation for life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, their achievements would surely match those of the great races' elites."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled reassuringly. "Mr. Pollitt, there's no need to fret. I'll find a way to heal you all. Don't ask how&mdash;just trust me, I'm confident."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It could be as short as three days or as long as a fortnight, but I promise to restore you all. By then, everyone can train with top-grade Essence Crystals."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it truly possible to heal us?" he asked, his voice tinged with hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded firmly. "Absolutely, within at most two weeks. Just be patient. Believe me; I'll ensure every one of you recovers your strength. By then, no major faction in Wild Flame City will dare disrespect Spark of Blaze again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes gleamed with unshakable confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as he ventured into the wild and dispatched more Deathborns, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity would devour enough high-grade death scent to fully recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he could utilize the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to heal Darren and the others completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, once the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was fully restored, he could release the members of the Blood Demon from the Dimensional Microcosm to assist him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Including Sebastian, Anastasia, Divine Shadow, and many more, they would all be freed from the confines of the Dimensional Microcosm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sending Betty and Darren on their way, Osborne began to contemplate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spark Estate is protected by a divine power shield and bolstered by over a million mid-grade Essence Crystals. For the time being, its safety should not be an issue."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My primary focus must now be on restoring the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tomorrow, I shall depart Wild Flame City and venture into the wild to hunt Deathborns, aiding the recovery of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. With my current strength, even encountering a Deity Overlord-level Deathborn poses no significant threat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I must find the area teeming with the most Deathborns in order to expedite the recovery of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity!"</span></p></div>
