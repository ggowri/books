        <h1>Chapter 61 The Rewards</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne did not hesitate for long. He hated Ophelia for her calculative behavior and for divorcing him and asking him to leave the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But he was better than this. He couldn&rsquo;t watch someone die when there was help.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">To put it another way, he hadn&rsquo;t made Ophelia kneel before him and regret divorcing him yet. If he let Ophelia die like this, then he couldn&rsquo;t vent his anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">So Osborne nodded and said, &ldquo;Ms. Radcliffe, if possible, please save her.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna glared at him coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Indecisive and too kind. You and this woman are enemies, but you still want to save her? If you want to become someone at the top, your kindness will kill you sooner or later,&rdquo; Donna pointed out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne smiled slightly and did not explain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa said nothing and began to use her powers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Soon, two masses of white light fell into Ophelia&rsquo;s and Wesley&rsquo;s bodies, and their pale faces gradually turned normal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing Clarissa also cured Wesley, Osborne frowned but did not call for a stop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;When they wake up, their injuries will be healed.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa became even weaker after treating them. She looked at Osborne deeply and parted her mouth as if she wanted to say something important.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, in the end, her words turned into a plain gratitude. &ldquo;Mr. Augustine, thank you again for saving me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ms. Radcliffe has already told me about what happened. You have done a good job. Go back and have some rest. Remember to come to work tomorrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;From now on, you will be one of Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguards,&rdquo; Donna chipped in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He finally became Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguard, and his second test of succession was finally completed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne didn&rsquo;t linger long and left the Radcliffe manor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This time&rsquo;s test for the successor was more difficult and dangerous than the first one. Not only was there a fierce gunfight but there were also encounters with metahumans and werewolves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He didn&rsquo;t know what happened to that person who controlled lightning. Judging from Donna&rsquo;s expression, that metahuman should have gotten away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was consumed with thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Why were these people so desperate to kill Clarissa? Osborne was afraid that he would encounter such danger again after becoming Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s expression was severe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If it weren&rsquo;t for Clarissa&rsquo;s superpowers, he would not have been a match for those dozen werewolves, let alone kill them all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was still not strong enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I wonder what reward the Godfather will give me after I complete the second successor test. There should be a way to upgrade the Satan&rsquo;s Eye to the third level, right?&rdquo; he whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Thinking of this, Osborne became excited again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The level two Satan&rsquo;s Eye only added X-ray vision and did nothing to improve Osborne&rsquo;s combat powers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But he would undergo a transformation after he upgraded Satan&rsquo;s Eye to level three.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He could manipulate matter after that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne didn&rsquo;t quite know the details, but it definitely would improve his strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was already dying to become stronger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Not long after, Osborne returned to the Institute of Human Research, and at the same time, the Draco Star Wristlet finally vibrated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The second star on the Draco Star Wristlet suddenly went from dim to twinkling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The second test was completed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s authority was also upgraded to two stars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At the same time, rewards were issued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne clicked on it expectantly, and sure enough, he saw the method to upgrade Satan&rsquo;s Eye to level three. He was surprised and started reading.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">To upgrade the Satan&rsquo;s Eye to level three, it needs to absorb the power of twenty pounds of purest and finest diamonds.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Purest and finest diamonds? Twenty pounds?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was stunned for a moment, and suddenly remembered the diamond earrings that Ophelia gave to Clarissa. The earrings were made of the finest diamond. Although they weighed only a few grams, they were worth millions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The best quality diamonds were undoubtedly natural and colored diamonds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">And twenty pounds of top-grade diamonds&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The corner of Osborne&rsquo;s mouth twitched. How much would twenty pounds of the finest natural diamonds cost?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At least a few hundred million dollars?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Maybe a billion dollars?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The most important thing was not the price but the scarcity. Every year, there were fewer natural diamonds, let alone the ones with color.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was pretty hard to get that many top-quality diamonds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Moreover, the quality of the diamonds used for upgrading determines the strength of Satan&rsquo;s Eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In other words, using twenty pounds of pure, natural, and colored big diamonds to enhance Satan&rsquo;s Eye would be much more powerful than using twenty pounds of plain ones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was either give up or be the best.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne decided that he would find a way to get the finest diamonds to upgrade, no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, there was no way to do it in the short term.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne looked at the other rewards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Soon he discovered that there was an extra 500 million dollars in his account.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The total balance reached 660 million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Five hundred million dollars&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was thrilled. This was only the second test of being the heir. The Godfather would reward him with 500 million dollars. Once the third test was completed, the reward would definitely be more than one billion dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Now, he had over 600 million dollars in his account, which was more than what most wealthy families had.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In addition to this, there seemed to be other rewards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne looked at it carefully, and a look of surprise appeared on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Luna Jewelry?&rdquo;</p></div>
