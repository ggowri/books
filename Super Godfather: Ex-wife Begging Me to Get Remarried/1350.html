        <h1>Chapter 1349 Silence!</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the only Transcendent Deity warrior of the Pantheon League was on the high platform, passionately sharing his cultivation insights with all the Superior Deities, Intermediate Deities, and Junior Deities below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was getting into the groove of his lecture, he suddenly sensed someone beside him and paused, taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Below the platform, the crowd erupted in shouts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell is this guy? Get down from there! Don't you know the rules? That's not a place for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who does he think he is, interrupting the teacher?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Which Divine Family does he belong to? He needs to be punished!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get down, you little punk!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apologize to the teacher!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with the chorus of jeers, Osborne wore a cold smirk. He didn't care one bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They seemed to think he was one of their own from the Pantheon League.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the Transcendent Deity warrior frowned and turned his gaze toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you? I'm giving a lecture here, and instead of listening attentively, you decide to climb up and disrupt my flow. Do you think my teaching isn't up to par? Do you have a problem with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, a menacing glint flashed in the warrior's eyes, a clear threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had assumed Osborne was just another young member of the Pantheon League.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you think my lecture is so terrible, why don't you take over?" He sneered, punctuating his words with a contemptuous snort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His challenge only fueled the anger of those below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Apologize to the teacher right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apologize! You really want to make the teacher mad? Are you asking for trouble?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get down on the ground!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Osborne spoke, his icy gaze sweeping over the crowd, "Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment their eyes met, a chill ran down the spines of everyone&mdash;Junior Deities, Intermediate Deities, even Superior Deities&mdash;who felt an overwhelming sense of dread wash over them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They quickly averted their eyes, no longer daring to shout at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold smile still on his face, Osborne turned to the Transcendent Deity warrior beside him and said, "You can step down now. I have something to say."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Transcendent Deity warrior was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "This guy wants me to step down?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm the only Transcendent Deity in this Dimensional Microcosm of the Pantheon League! I'm the most powerful and respected here! He's just a young upstart, and he thinks he can disrupt my lecture and order me around?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He's asking for a death wish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the Transcendent Deity was about to unleash his anger, he caught Osborne's cold gaze. A shiver ran through him, and a wave of fear washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those eyes! The murderous intent behind them felt almost palpable, chilling him to the bone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne must have taken many lives to possess such a gaze!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he forgot his status as a Transcendent Deity and found himself stepping down from the platform, fear overtaking him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked at this display of compliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Smart move! If you hadn't stepped down, I was seriously considering killing you to make a point."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words echoed through the crowd, plunging the room into stunned silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone stared at Osborne, their expressions a mix of confusion and shock, wondering if they had heard him correctly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "Did he really just say he would kill the teacher if the teacher didn't comply?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is he out of his mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was left in a state of bewilderment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Osborne broke the silence, his tone calm and steady. "Let me introduce myself. I'm not part of the Pantheon League. I hail from the Augustine family of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>. I'm the head of the Augustine family, the Godfather of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>. My name is Osborne Augustine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne finished speaking, an eerie silence enveloped the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Pantheon League were wide-eyed, disbelief etched across their faces as they stared at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone shouted from the crowd, "I recognize him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's Osborne! I've seen him before; he doesn't belong to our Pantheon League! How the hell did he get in here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>He's</span><span> our enemy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that rallying cry, chaos erupted among the members of the Pantheon League. Anger surged through the ranks as they turned their furious glares on Osborne, bloodlust palpable in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, instead of showing fear, Osborne wore a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a chilling light sparked in his eyes, and the man who had called out suddenly froze, his body turning to stone. Moments later, the stone shattered, </span><span>fragments of his Divine Body bursting apart like fireworks in the night sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne commanded, his voice cold and unwavering, "Silence! Shut the hell up! Anyone else who dares to speak will meet the same fate! I'm going to keep killing until you're all quiet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words dripped with lethal intent, filling the air with an ominous threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the Pantheon League was not easily cowed. With over three thousand Divine warriors present, their fury burned even hotter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Who do you think you are, you little punk, to dare..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speaker was engulfed in ocular energy as Osborne's gaze caught him, and in an instant, his body exploded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're asking for it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another warrior met the same gruesome fate, bursting apart under Osborne's icy glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's cold, merciless eyes continued to scan the crowd, targeting every soul that dared to utter a word.</span></p></div>
