        <h1>Chapter 1420 Remained Unexposed</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne decided it was time to report to his direct superior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His squad had suffered the loss of four members during the last mission, and he needed to request replacements. Additionally, his Malevolence Amulet had been destroyed, so he would need a new one as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But first, Osborne had to report to his superior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a squad leader in the Wild Flame Army, he didn't have access to the higher-ups; his direct supervisor was merely a centurion named Jeffrey Alick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey belonged to the Aether Hawks Clan, which, while not as powerful as the Demonic Dragon Clan, Soaring Lion Clan, or Mystic Feather Clan, still ranked among the top ten in Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne made his way to Jeffrey's residence, which wasn't far from his own stone house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon arrival, he reported in, and the divine power lock on the stone door opened automatically. With a respectful demeanor, Osborne stepped inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the spacious living room, he soon found Jeffrey, a Transcendent Deity warrior, surrounded by several others who appeared to be in the midst of a meeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A quick glance confirmed, thanks to Lachlan's memories, that these were all squad leaders under Jeffrey's command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Including "Lachlan," all ten squad leaders were present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow in surprise; he hadn't anticipated a meeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey spoke calmly, "Lachlan, you're just in time. We were about to discuss a situation near the No. 9 mining area where a large number of Deathborn have been spotted. Among them are several Superior Deity Deathborns and even a Transcendent Deity Deathborn. The chiliarch has decided to send us in to handle it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you've completed your last mission, you'll be joining us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, how did your previous mission go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, Osborne's expression turned serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Report, Mr. Alick. During my mission, we encountered some unexpected issues. The rebellious miners had hidden deep within the mine, and while we were capturing them, we were ambushed by Deathborns. We lost four members in the process, and I barely escaped with my life, thanks to the protection of my Malevolence Amulet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he finished speaking, Jeffrey's face darkened, and the other nine squad leaders cast disdainful glances at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey snapped, "Pathetic!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were just supposed to catch a few rebellious miners&mdash;lowly humans at that! How could you lose four members? I'm starting to doubt your qualifications as a squad leader!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly lowered his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Alick, it's my fault for being incompetent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph!" Jeffrey glared at him, completely oblivious to the fact that Lachlan had been replaced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, using the Eclipsing Mantra, had perfectly disguised himself as Lachlan, leaving no room for suspicion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, let's hear what everyone thinks. How should we punish Lachlan for this blunder?" Jeffrey asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the squad leaders chuckled. "Mr. Alick, I think someone like Lachlan doesn't deserve to be a squad leader at all! He should be stripped of his position and demoted to a regular member in my squad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another chimed in, laughing, "The native Human Community from Celestara really is the lowest of the low. If he can't handle something so simple, it's a disgrace!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I say we should just kick him out of the Wild Flame Army altogether!" another leader added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nine squad leaders took turns voicing their scorn, their eyes filled with mockery and disdain as they regarded "Lachlan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Lachlan was a Transcendent Deity warrior, and several of them were merely Superior Deities, that didn't stop them from looking down on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Lachlan was from the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey finally interjected, "We won't go so far as to expel him from the Wild Flame Army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, Lachlan, you must face consequences for your mistakes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm imposing a three-month deduction from your military pay as punishment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne feigned a look of forced submission, his teeth gritted as he spoke, "Thank you for your leniency, Mr. Alick. I will work even harder from now on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alick replied dismissively, "Alright, let's drop the matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll handle the paperwork to replenish your team and reissue the Malevolence Amulet. Now, let's focus on the mission outside the No. 9 mining area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This area houses over 400 thousand human miners who deliver over 200 million low-grade Essence Crystals each month to our Wild Flame Army. No. 9 mining area is crucial, and since we've detected high-level Deathborns, we must eradicate them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey then began allocating tasks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne exhaled silently, relieved that the charade remained unexposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neither Jeffrey nor the other squad leaders had any inkling that "Lachlan" had been replaced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this cover intact, he could proceed with his plans smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before anything else, Osborne's priority was to fully recover his powers, especially his space elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This essence was his lifeline, providing the ability to escape when faced with insurmountable foes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Achieving this recovery required substantial high-grade death scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He mused, "This mission to eliminate the Deathborns might just be the opportunity I need to regain my strength."</span></p></div>
