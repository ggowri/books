        <h1>Chapter 1046 Anger-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I don&rsquo;t want it! It&rsquo;s not enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will defeat you and let you see how powerful and excellent I am! I will let you know that you are unworthy of me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just wait and see!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Ophelia quickly left the Human Slave culturing room because her time control was about to expire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had reached Class AAA, and her power in controlling time had become stronger. She could control the time of an area and freeze it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the time couldn't exceed one minute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One minute was almost up. Ophelia returned to the door, closed it, and canceled the </span><span>control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The time was restored in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the human slave culturing room didn't know that Ophelia had come in. They continued to do their work and had no idea that the time here had been frozen for nearly a minute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two Human Slaves didn't know it, either. They stopped Ophelia with expressionless faces. "No one can enter the room except the master."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia sneered, said nothing, and left.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And this piece of Ultra Diamond is just a regular material. Without any power on it, it's naturally flimsy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In fact, if any deity were to grant it power, Ultra Diamond would be on par with ordinary divine artifacts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rubbed his nose awkwardly, realizing he'd made a blunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you're saying that as our technology advances, one day we could even make divine artifacts ourselves?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Antonio said seriously, "Absolutely! As long as you, Mr. Augustine, reach the level of a deity and master divine power, you could endow them with strength and transform them into divine artifacts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rubbed his nose again, feeling a bit sheepish. He wasn't even close to Class S, let alone a deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That felt so far out of reach!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But thanks to Antonio's explanations, he finally understood how divine artifacts were created.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about its hardness? Is it sufficient?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Antonio's eyes lit up as he gazed at the Goddess of Grain's scythe, his excitement palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"More than enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's definitely the hardest and sharpest divine artifact I've ever seen! It clearly hasn't been empowered by any deity, so it's not technically a divine artifact, yet it can effortlessly slice through Ultra Diamond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although I haven't conducted a detailed test yet, its hardness is estimated at least ten times that of diamond&mdash;possibly even higher! I'm going to take it for testing and analysis right now. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps through this, we can indeed develop Hyper Diamond, taking our advanced materials to the next level."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With huge excitement, Antonio carefully took the Goddess of Grain's scythe and rushed to test it with the institute's cutting-edge technology.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curious, Osborne lingered instead of leaving right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The testing results came in soon. When Antonio reviewed them, his eyes went wide with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the matter?" Osborne asked, intrigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Antonio took a deep breath and exclaimed, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, it&rsquo;s amazing! Our best instruments couldn't measure its exact </span><span>hardness, meaning it exceeds the higher detection limits of the equipment. The limit was fifty times the hardness of a diamond!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In our previous analyses of divine artifacts, the toughest one only matched up to ten times the hardness of a diamond! Most couldn't even reach twice the hardness!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's definitely the toughest super material I've ever seen!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's even more incredible is that we've managed to analyze 99% of its components! If we can try out based on these findings, even if we can't replicate its hardness exactly, we'll still make significant strides!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm confident we can develop Hyper Diamond within three days! And who knows? In the near future, we could even create even more advanced materials like Mega Diamond and Tera Diamond!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but share in Antonio's enthusiasm. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let's get to work! With the looming threat, we need more super energy guns and cutting-edge weaponry now more than ever!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Antonio replied with determination written all over his face, "Absolutely! You can count on me, Mr. Augustine! I won't let you down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he dove headfirst into his work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Kash from the Weapons Research Institute was buoyant. He had everything in place; once Hyper Diamond was successfully developed, he'd be ready to mass-produce a new line of weapons and gear that would outshine anything they had made before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne decided it was time to check in with the second-in-command at the Weapons Research Institute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He summoned Giovanni Mirante, Antonio's brother, and another top-tier researcher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Antonio was focused on Hyper Diamond, Giovanni had been tasked with other critical projects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne asked, "Giovanni, have you finished analyzing the samples of ore that were sent over? Any new discoveries?"</span></p></div>
