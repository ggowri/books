        <h1>Chapter 978 Shocked Greyson</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Lambert family's assumptions were just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They had no idea how many assassins from the Eityreia Organization lurked in the shadows nor how many Class S elite killers might be among them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Eityreia assassins were notorious for their stealth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They could blend into the darkness, waiting patiently for the slightest crack in the Lambert family's defenses before striking with deadly precision, only to vanish without a trace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was the most terrifying aspect of their tactics.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seemed that the Eityreia Organization wasn't in a rush to wipe out the Lambert family. Instead, they appeared to relish the slow torment of their prey, drawing out the fear and despair as the Lambert family members fell one by one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne felt a heavy weight settle in his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Lambert family was a hidden superpower; while they were formidable, they were no match for the Eityreia Organization. The stark reality was that their numbers were limited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In just two days, over fifty family members had been assassinated, a devastating blow that left the Lambert family reeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Osborne pondered how to assist the Lambert family in overcoming this crisis, they finally reached the heart of their territory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was a towering wooden lodge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Augustine family's reinforcements have arrived!" Stuart shouted from a distance, his voice echoing through the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, a group of high-ranking members from the Lambert family burst forth from the lodge, including Aleena, the family's venerable elder, and familiar faces like Rhett and Vivian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the forefront stood an elderly man, his expression a mix of excitement and expectation as he scanned the scene for reinforcements from the Augustine family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His gaze landed on Osborne, and the joy in his eyes instantly froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The others in the Lambert family shared his confusion, their initial excitement quickly morphing into uncertainty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stuart, where are the reinforcements from the Augustine family?" the elder inquired, his brow furrowing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart shifted awkwardly, gesturing toward Osborne. "Mr. Greyson Lambert, esteemed elders, this is Osborne. He's the only one the Augustine family sent to assist us.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Although there is only one, he is very powerful!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Only Osborne?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The disappointment was palpable in the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Aleena's expression dimmed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She recognized Osborne's strength, but he was still just Class AAA. No matter how talented he was, one person couldn't possibly resolve the Lambert family's dire situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It seems the Augustine family can't spare any more help. We'll have to rely on ourselves."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Lambert family members' faces were clouded with disappointment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne rubbed the back of his neck, feeling a bit awkward under their collective gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nevertheless, he stepped forward and offered a respectful bow to the elder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The elderly man was Greyson Lambert, the head of the family. As he regarded Osborne, his pale complexion and weary eyes spoke volumes. The realization that the Augustine family had sent only one young man to aid them cast a shadow of disappointment over his already tired features.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm Osborne Augustine, pleasure to meet you, Mr. Greyson Lambert."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, it's a pleasure to meet you," Greyson said, his tone flat yet polite.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He then turned to Aleena. "Please make sure to accommodate our young friend here. Regardless of the circumstances, he represents the Augustine family, and we must ensure his safety. We can't afford any mishaps."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Greyson strode back into the lodge, clearly viewing Osborne's arrival as more of a burden than a boon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Instead of bolstering their forces, they would now have to divert attention and resources to protect him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne felt his cheeks heat up with embarrassment as he scratched his nose again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Lambert family members, now disheartened, turned to follow Greyson inside, leaving Aleena, Rhett, and Vivian among the few who remained with Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as Greyson was about to step into the wooden cabin, his phone suddenly buzzed to life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without a second thought, he answered urgently, "Wesson... What?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A gasp escaped his lips as he abruptly turned to face Osborne, his expression one of sheer shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The members of the Lambert family looked at him curiously, puzzled by his sudden outburst. They thought, "Is there more support coming from the Augustine family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But before they could ponder too long, they watched as Greyson hung up the phone and quickly strode towards Osborne, his demeanor charged with excitement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He stopped a mere six feet from Osborne, and to everyone's astonishment, he bowed deeply and addressed him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Head of the Lambert family, Greyson, pay my respects to the Godfather! I humbly apologize for my previous disrespect; I didn't know your true identity. Please forgive me," Greyson announced loudly, his voice echoing through the gathered crowd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Instantly, all eyes were on Greyson, then snapped back to Osborne, their expressions a mix of disbelief and astonishment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They thought, "Godfather?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What Godfather?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Our clan leader is bowing to Osborne, a younger man, and referred to him as Godfather?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The realization hit everyone in the Lambert family like a tidal wave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They stared at Osborne, bewildered, as the weight of the situation sank in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before anyone could fully process it, Greyson raised his voice again, snapping the others back to reality. "What are you all standing around for? The Godfather is here in the Lambert family! Get down and show your respect!"</p></div>
