        <h1>Chapter 624 The Most Dangerous Battle</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was utterly bewildered by the onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had just retracted his Vampire Transformation when the instructors attacked like frenzied beasts. Previously, the combined efforts of six instructors had already left him feeling trapped, without a clear path to victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with twenty instructors joining forces, including three at Class AA and the rest at Class A+, their assault was even more ferocious and reckless. In an instant, Osborne felt as if he was in a desperate situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only use his martial art aura for defense, but it shattered in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Osborne's body was robust enough; otherwise, he would have been killed already.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't defeat them, not a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under their relentless assault, Osborne didn't even have the opportunity to reveal his identity. If he didn't come up with a plan, he feared he would be killed here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These people were all helpers and subordinates awarded to him by Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he were to be killed like this, it would be such a grievance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, Osborne immediately activated his dark elemental power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body instantly transformed into a shadowy figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, he had no physical form, making ordinary attacks utterly ineffective against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as Osborne let out a sigh of relief, his Satan's Eye began to throb wildly. A strong sense of danger welled up within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second thought, Osborne dodged immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, a blinding beam of light shot down from the sky, striking the spot where he had been. The place that was hit displayed a terrifying scorch mark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Energy weapons can threaten me now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Transforming into a shadow with his dark elemental power allowed him to hide effectively, but it was no match for Light Transformation, the light elemental power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Light Transformation could deflect all physical and energy attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the shadow form could only evade physical attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Energy attacks could still harm him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, Osborne controlled his shadowy form swiftly, frantically evading the shadows, avoiding the attacks from above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what he did, the combat drones above could lock onto his position, firing down energy attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These energy attacks were not particularly powerful. Under normal circumstances, Osborne could easily defend against them, but in his shadow form, he was at a disadvantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, an energy attack struck Osborne, piercing through his body and causing him to lose the shadow form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His physical body quickly reappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The twenty instructors seemed to have been waiting for this moment. They immediately rushed up again, ferociously attacking Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The furious assault gave Osborne no chance to catch his breath. He never expected that the most dangerous battle of his life would be at the hands of his own subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, he had no opportunity to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I must transform into a vampire! Only then can I intimidate them, only then can I have a chance to speak! Otherwise, I will be killed by them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gritted his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It required time to transform into a vampire. He had to find a way to buy himself some time to transform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly pondered what other options he had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial power? No! In such an intense battle, I don't have the chance to escape through interdimensional travel. I'd be destroyed before the dimensional rift even formed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thunder Power? No! Although the Thunder Power is powerful, it's not enough to handle this group of instructors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wind elemental power? Water elemental power?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Metal elemental power?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fire elemental power?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earth elemental power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly went through all the powers he had mastered, but none could change his current predicament or give him a chance to stop the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he thought of a method.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It might work!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't have time to think it through. He was on the verge of collapsing and instantly activated his light elemental power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Light!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, an intense burst of light erupted from Osborne's body. He became like a dazzling sun, causing everyone around to feel a sharp sting in their eyes, blinding them temporarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even so, the group of instructors remained unflustered and unafraid. They closed their eyes and began to carry out coordinated area attacks. They maintained their assault, not giving Osborne a chance to transform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't notice the light around them twisting rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the intense light faded, they finally saw Osborne again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group charged at Osborne once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, countless attacks landed on Osborne, shattering his body and sending flesh and blood flying everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group of instructors let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We finally got him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, that wasn't his real body! That was just an illusion!" someone shouted suddenly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, an extreme sense of fear and suppression arose in each of their hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their bodies began to tremble violently, and their faces turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! He completed the Vampire Transformation after all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attack together. We must kill him!"</span></p></div>
