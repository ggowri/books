        <h1>Chapter 887 Ninety-Five Wins</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne quickly racked up an impressive eighty consecutive wins.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Notably, Clarissa and Emma had also stepped into the ring. They currently ranked 300 and 299 in the Godson Rankings.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They naturally didn't intend to push Osborne too hard and soon "fell" to him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With every match, Osborne surged ahead effortlessly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In his eighty-fifth challenge, he bested Kate Winslet, who was ranked 230th.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By the ninetieth bout, he defeated Megan Robinson, who was in the 200th spot.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This brought his streak to a remarkable ninety wins.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, this wasn't the end for Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though his opponents were the elite from their respective nations, ranked within the top two hundred, they simply couldn't hold him back.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a series of intense battles, he finally reached ninety-five consecutive victories.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd watching was left in awe.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Osborne had struggled and exhausted himself for his ninety-five wins, perhaps they could have accepted it. But here he was, standing tall, still brimming with energy as if he hadn't broken a sweat.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was as if Osborne hadn't spent any energy at all.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Excitement lit up the eyes of everyone from the Augustine family.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ninety-five consecutive wins was the record set by Sebastian himself!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Over forty years ago, during his Honor Quest Ceremony, Sebastian had also achieved ninety-five victories but collapsed just short of the legendary one hundred wins.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was a long-standing regret that haunted both him and the Augustine family.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The century mark was a significant milestone.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Sebastian's ninety-five wins remained the best in their family's history. The second-best was only a bit over sixty.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, Osborne had equaled that proud record.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His achievement was beyond anyone in the Augustine family's wildest expectations.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Wesson, who had thought the most Osborne could manage was fifty wins, was left speechless.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knew Osborne was Sebastian's grandson and thought that fifty wins would sufficiently mark him worthy of the name.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now? Fifty wins was nothing!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne had matched Sebastian's mark, and with just one more win, he could surpass it and etch his name into the Augustine family's history anew.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was even on the verge of a hundred victories!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wesson's eyes glistened with tears as he looked at Osborne on the stage, who was still full of vitality.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sebastian, are you watching? I finally understand why you believed in him so much! He really can do it!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The members of the Augustine family were filled with a whirlpool of excitement and anticipation, eager for Osborne to take one more victory and break Sebastian's record.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As they watched him, they couldn't help but feel they were witnessing the rise of a new legend.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was buzzing with exhilaration, too.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He could feel the weight of every challenge growing heavier, each opponent more formidable than the last, demanding more energy with every win.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he had made it to ninety-five victories.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just one more win, and I'll surpass Grandfather," Osborne thought, clenching his jaw as he turned to face his opponent for the ninety-sixth battle.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A cloaked woman stepped onto the arena and slowly pulled back her hood, revealing a stunning face.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she came into view, Osborne frowned, feeling an unpleasant scent radiating from her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne recognized her name immediately: Felicity.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She held the 128th spot in the Godson Rankings.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But beyond that, he knew nothing about her. No details were provided in the rankings.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Felicity smiled softly at him, "Well, isn't this a coincidence? I just happen to be your opponent for the ninety-sixth match! Maybe it's fate, or perhaps destiny itself!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She finished speaking and looked Osborne up and down with a cold smirk.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne frowned, perplexed. "Fate? What do you mean by that?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a calm smile, Felicity replied, "It seems you're not aware of my background! I didn't plan on revealing it, but since it's such a coincidence, it would be a shame to keep it from you.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Remember this: my teacher is the King of the Aberrants! I'm his fourth direct disciple and his granddaughter!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At her words, Osborne's expression hardened, his eyes glinting with cold fury.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The realization sent a chill through him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had never expected that his ninety-sixth opponent would be Gerardo's own flesh and blood.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne thought, "The granddaughter of the King of the Aberrants? The fourth disciple?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How dare she come to Rosmandi?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How could she step foot on the Augustine Estate?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Doesn't she fear for her death?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyes burned with murderous intent.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Felicity, however, seemed unfazed by his growing hostility. "Osborne, do you know who ultimately defeated Sebastian during his Honor Quest Ceremony over forty years ago?"</p></div>
