        <h1>Chapter 981 Invite the Lambert Family</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greyson felt a flicker of confidence returning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had survived an assassination attempt by a Class S assassin from the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization. Although he had been injured, he was still alive. If the assailants had been from Sin or Crimson, he likely wouldn't have made it out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being a Class S himself, he knew he was no match for the top-tier assassins from those organizations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as they're not from Sin or Crimson, I can hold my own," Greyson thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But confidence alone couldn't alter the perilous situation the Lambert family found themselves in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shadow of the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization loomed large, their assassins lurking unseen. They could strike at any moment, and without knowing the size or strength of their enemy, it felt as if the walls were closing in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every member of the Lambert family lived under the constant dread of being hunted. If this situation didn't change, the already dwindling numbers of the Lambert family wouldn't be able to withstand the onslaught for long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greyson furrowed his brow, pondering a solution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne spoke up, "Mr. Lambert, have you considered temporarily leaving this place? The </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization has locked onto you. Even if you fend off this wave of assassins, more, likely stronger ones, will come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We all know how the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization operates&mdash;once they strike, they won't rest until the Lambert family is wiped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unless the Lambert family has the means to stand against the entire </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, your only option is to leave and seek refuge, perhaps even ally with another powerful force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're open to it, you could stay with the Augustine family. We have extensive high-tech defenses, making it nearly impossible for an average </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization assassin to infiltrate. Even if a Class S assassin were to attack, the Augustine family has more than enough skilled fighters to help you deal with them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne finished speaking, Greyson felt a jolt of realization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Osborne with gratitude. "Godfather, I can't thank you enough for offering to shelter the Lambert family. We are more than willing to go to the Augustine family, but wouldn't that put you all at risk from the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization as well?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled softly, a knowing glint in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He understood that taking in the Lambert family would indeed draw the organization's attention toward the Augustine family, but it didn't concern him. Even without the Lambert family, the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization would sooner or later target them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By helping the Lambert family, they could gain valuable allies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides Greyson, the Lambert family had their elder head, who was a Class S warrior, along with several Class AAA fighters. If the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> launched an attack on the Augustine family, those additional hands would be priceless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rest assured, Mr. Lambert, the Augustine family has its own score to settle with the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization. Our enemies' enemies can always be allies. Plus, the Augustine </span><span>and Lambert families have a long-standing friendship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now's the time for us to band together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, I'm sure you're aware that the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> is targeting the Augustine family right now. We need all the help we can get! If you agree to stay, the Augustine family would welcome you with open arms. And if you'd rather not get involved in our war with the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, I understand. I'll still do my utmost to help you navigate this crisis."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's sincerity was evident; he was clear about his intentions&mdash;gaining a powerful ally in the Lambert family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the weight of Osborne's sincerity, Greyson found himself moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a serious tone, Greyson spoke, "Godfather, you're too kind. The threat from the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> isn't just a problem for the Augustine family; it deeply concerns the Lambert family as well. Even without your invitation, when the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> come knocking, we'll stand by you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, during their reign over </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>, the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> was nothing short of brutal. The superpowers of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> had a hell of a time coping with their bloodshed. That's why, decades ago, we didn't hesitate to help the former Godfather fight back against them. With that history, now that the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> has returned, it surely won't spare us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greyson's determination radiated from him as he continued, "So, Godfather, I've made up my mind. I'll lead the entire Lambert family to the Augustine Estate to take refuge from the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization's assassins, and we'll join forces to confront the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face broke into a wide grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Excellent! The Augustine family will welcome you all with open arms!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of relief washed over Greyson. At last, he had a plan to address their pressing issue&mdash;he felt like a massive weight had been lifted off his shoulders. However, he quickly realized that getting everyone to the Augustine Estate wouldn't come without its challenges.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, they still had no idea how many assassins surrounded them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of their relentless pursuit loomed over him like a dark cloud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way the assassins would just let them slip away unchallenged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frowning, he spoke again, "Godfather, while the Lambert family may not be large, we still have nearly a thousand members. The journey to the Augustine Estate is over 300 miles, and it's fraught with danger. We know little about the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization's assassins in the area. If they strike on the road, we could incur devastating losses."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded thoughtfully, his expression turning icy. "Then we take care of the assassin threat first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greyson's brow furrowed in concern. "And how do you propose we do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leave it to me!" Osborne replied.</span></p></div>
