        <h1>Chapter 221 Engage</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's lips were refreshingly cool, with a hint of sweetness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was caught off guard by Clarissa's initiative, and as he processed what was happening, his heart suddenly raced with excitement, unable to resist reciprocating passionately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two then embraced in a kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna, Barlyn, and Orion, who were standing nearby, were stunned by the unexpected kiss happening right in front of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a gloomy expression, Donna wanted to speak but ultimately remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn, on the other hand, was incredibly excited and somewhat pleased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Orion was trembling with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He roared, waving his hand abruptly, "Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a sudden surge of power behind him. Satan's Eye began pulsating violently, alerting him of imminent danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne reluctantly pulled away from Clarissa's lips, quickly pushing her aside and deftly dodging backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next second, a dimensional rift appeared abruptly between him and Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne hadn't reacted swiftly to push Clarissa away and dodge himself, the terrifying dimensional rift would have sliced his body in half like an unstoppable blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's face showed fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned icy cold in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's voice was menacing. "Orion, you're seeking death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Sneak attack? Orion's trying to kill me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion's face, too, was filled with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's you who's seeking death!" Orion's voice was cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "How dare Osborne kiss Clarissa in front of me? Clarissa is the woman I've set my sights on, the wife I must marry no matter what.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, my woman was kissed by Osborne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce wave of Orion's hand, a massive dimensional rift appeared in front of Osborne, attempting to swallow him whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sensed the danger and swiftly moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, dimensional rifts kept appearing along his path. If Osborne didn't have Satan's Eye to foresee danger, any accidental contact with these rifts would have left him severely injured, if not fatally wounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard! Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion's eyes glinted with hatred. He thought, "How dare Osborne touch my woman? Osborne must die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as Orion watched Osborne continuously evade his attacks, his face reflected shock and grew gravely serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Interesting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion was surprised. Although he hadn't even used thirty percent of his power at this moment, not revealing his Class B+ metahuman strength, the fact that Osborne could dodge his attacks was impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're probably close to Class B, isn't it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But do you think you can challenge me like this? You're simply pathetic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Orion prepared to unleash his full power to take down Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at that moment, Clarissa suddenly rushed out and stood in front of Osborne, shielding him with her outstretched arms, glaring coldly at Orion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Orion, stop this right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion frowned. He only wanted to kill Osborne, not Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's fate power was key to his rise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to halt his attack, stating coldly, "Do you always hide behind women? If you've got any guts, face me in a fight. Let's settle this once and for all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was about to speak when Clarissa sternly interjected, "Orion, you better leave immediately! Otherwise, I will have to take action against you! The estate is equipped with the Draco Group's Class A defense system!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion's face instantly hardened at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the heir of the Lark family, he had naturally heard of the Draco Group's Class A defense system and understood the system's formidable capability. Despite being a Class B+ metahuman himself, he wouldn't fare well against it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he chose to fight, he might survive the encounter, but he would undoubtedly be severely injured!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion hesitated for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Clarissa's fierce protection of Osborne only fueled his anger, intensifying his determination to kill Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He snapped, "Fine, fine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I come here with good intentions, and I get this kind of humiliation? I'll remember this day, and let me tell you, the two of you being together is nothing more than a pipe dream!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm taking this level two ancient magic weapon straight to Sir Radcliffe myself! I want to see if Sir Radcliffe and the Wise Order will reject me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Orion shot Osborne a look of sheer contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's eyes widened in alarm. She thought, "If Orion shows up at the Radcliffe Estate with a level two ancient magic weapon, Grandpa and the Wise Order will definitely accept.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, it's a level two ancient magic weapon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And with Orion's status, background, and talents, he's even better than Apollo. His power is rare spatial power. If the Lark family weren't so low-key, the Wise Order would have chosen Orion over Apollo fifteen years ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how can I stop him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There's no way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could only remain silent, continuing to shield Osborne to prevent Orion from making any move against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion cast a cold glance at Osborne. "I won't forget you. Next time I show up, Clarissa will be mine, and you'll be a corpse!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!" Orion ordered, snapping his fingers to create a dimensional rift that swallowed the large iron chest containing the Sacred Sorceress statue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave, he and his entourage strode out of the Radcliffe Manor.</span></p></div>
