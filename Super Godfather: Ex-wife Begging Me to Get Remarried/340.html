        <h1>Chapter 340 Fierce Fight</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a strong physique!" The metal elemental controlling metahuman frowned, looking a little serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He controlled Osborne's metal buttons and launched a sneak attack. He thought even if he couldn't kill Osborne, he could at least seriously injure him. However, Osborne was not hurt at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne endured his attack and didn't get injured at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It gave the man a bad feeling. Osborne's physique might be even more robust than that of his three companions, who were Class A- martial artists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leading man in black shouted, "Kill him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It will be a great shame if we can't even kill a young metahuman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three Class A- martial artists had already rushed to a place not far from Osborne. They sneered and punched Osborne from three directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their punches were too fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like cannonballs fired from a gun, there was an extremely sonic boom sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It showed that the speed of their punches far exceeded the speed of sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The faster the punch was, the greater the power would be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was more, the three people's strength was mighty, and they even punched together. Facing such an attack, Osborne dared not endure it with his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Devil's Light burst out in an instant, covering Osborne's body and protecting him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang!" The punches of the three people fell on Osborne. Like a sandbag, he flew into mid-air and couldn't stabilize at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Osborne could stop, the three men rushed over, kicking, punching, and elbowing him. Every part of their bodies was used as a weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a while, Osborne couldn't fight against them at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he did not panic. Although the three men attacked him hard, he was not injured. He had a strong physique, and the Devil's Light was protecting him. Their attacks were fierce, but they could not seriously hurt him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if it was just a minor injury, Osborne had excellent recovery ability. He could recover instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborn became calmer and thought, "The strength of the three people is far inferior to that of Isa. Even though Isa hides her strength, she is much stronger than them. It seems that they don't have advanced power. They can't even break the Devil's Light defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it's difficult for me to fight back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have learned martial arts skills from Isa for a few days, but it's not enough. Compared with these martial artists who have practiced for decades, I still have a big gap with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, I have to fight against three at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There are still two Class A- metahumans in the distance, accumulating strength and ready to give me a fatal blow at any time. They are the biggest threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I must find a way out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While being beaten, Osborne was thinking of a way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't know how shocked and terrified the three martial artists were. All three of them were Class A- martial artists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a Class A martial artist would at least suffer some injuries under their attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was being hit fiercely by them, but they felt that Osborne was not injured at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their attacks were just like tickling to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Devil's Light around Osborne weakened most of the strength of their punches. Besides, Osborne had a stunningly robust body. The three men felt as if they were beating a turtle covered with a hard shell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't even injure Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" The leading man in black found that something was wrong. He cursed and then waved his hands. Soon, countless ice blades condensed around him. Even the sea beneath his feet was frozen by his ice elemental power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go!" In an instant, the densely packed ice blades flew toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The metal elemental controlling metahuman created a huge sword and stabbed it towards Osborne's chest. "You are a dead man!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Satan's Eye started pulsing wildly, reminding Osborne of the danger. Osborne took a glance and immediately noticed the opponent's full-strength attacks. If he endured them, he would at least be seriously injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems that I have to reveal more about my strength," Osborne snorted coldly. "It my turn now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His short hair grew wildly and became long and blood-red in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His two tiger teeth became long and sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And his fingernails were long, as sharp as daggers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His handsome face became paler and more angular.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne transformed and became a Vampire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Osborne absorbed the power of blood diamonds, his body had completely merged with the Blood Cross, and the process of transforming into a Vampire had become faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In almost the blink of an eye, the transformation was complete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt that his body had become more potent, as if it possessed infinite power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attacks approached him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless ice blades and the huge sword attacked him fiercely.</span></p></div>
