        <h1>Chapter 868 Controversy</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa and Emma no longer appeared on the challenge stage.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As time flew by, the atmosphere grew quieter, and soon, it was the day before the Honor Quest Ceremony.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Osborne remained in seclusion, preparing for the event.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On this day, the elders of the Augustine family, along with the young elite&mdash;Vincent, Matthew, Emma, and others&mdash;gathered in the conference hall at Mount One.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Declan raised a hand, signaling for silence.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Everyone, tomorrow marks the Honor Quest Ceremony! I want to thank you all for your cooperation during this period; it has helped us avoid embarrassing moments for the Augustine family."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The room fell silent, all eyes fixed on Declan.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've called you here today for an important discussion. As you know, the Honor Quest Ceremony is dedicated to Osborne. He will face challenges from the world's young elites until he is defeated.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"According to tradition, the one who defeats Osborne will receive a substantial prize, including a divine artifact and a cash reward of 500 billion!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now we need to figure out which divine artifact to use as the prize."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this, murmurs spread through the crowd.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's there to discuss? Just grab any Ordinary divine artifact as the prize!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"An Ordinary divine artifact? That's not enough! If we settle for just an Ordinary divine artifact, the other major powers will mock us! The level of the prize reflects our family's reputation; we can't afford to look stingy!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Reputation? What reputation? I still can't wrap my head around why the Godfather is even holding this Honor Quest Ceremony for Osborne. With his strength, it's bound to turn into a spectacle of shame!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Augustine family is destined to become a laughingstock!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then why should we even care about reputation? If we're not using an Ordinary divine artifact, are we supposed to use a Premium one? Are you willing to provide that?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Exactly! How many Premium divine artifacts do we even have?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If Osborne can pull off a fifty-win streak or more during his Honor Quest, then offering a Premium divine artifact wouldn't be a problem. At least the Augustine family would gain some glory! But with Osborne's current strength... ha! If he manages ten wins, I'll be surprised!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm with you; let's stick to an Ordinary divine artifact!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We're already set for humiliation; we can't afford to lose another Premium divine artifact!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I agree!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The elders of the Augustine family engaged in heated debate, most of them doubting Osborne's abilities and convinced that the Honor Quest Ceremony would end in disgrace.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If they were destined to lose embarrassingly, why waste a Premium divine artifact on it?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma interjected with a cold huff. "Enough! Who says Osborne's Honor Quest Ceremony will be a disgrace? He's going to shine in that arena and make us all feel a sense of pride!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her declaration silenced the room, and everyone turned to her in disbelief.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One elder scoffed, saying, "Emma, what are you talking about?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne hasn't even cracked the Godson Rankings. How could he possibly shine at the Honor Quest Ceremony? How could he bring us glory?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If he manages ten wins, I'll be satisfied just to avoid mockery."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma's gaze hardened. "You all have no idea what Osborne is capable of! And who says he's not in the Godson Rankings?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's ranked 205th!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The room fell silent again, stunned by her claim.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's ridiculous! The one ranked 205th is a guy named Axell, and he..."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, the speaker fell silent.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A look of shock crossed his face. "Emma, you disguised yourself as Maia from the Lambert family to attend Cuthbert's Honor Quest Ceremony. You went with Axell. Was that Osborne?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma smiled, "Only just piecing it together now? Yes, Axell is Osborne! So tell me, do you still think his Honor Quest Ceremony will end in disgrace?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Silence enveloped the room as everyone absorbed the revelation, their expressions a mix of astonishment and disbelief.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But it wasn't long before someone broke the quiet. "Even if Osborne is ranked 205th in the Godson Rankings, what's the big deal? Cuthbert is ranked 36th, and he couldn't even achieve fifty consecutive wins! Osborne might only manage twenty, maybe thirty at most."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Right, thirty wins at best!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The elders of the Augustine were still reluctant to accept Osborne's potential.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A calm voice suddenly interrupted, "Am I really only good for thirty wins?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All eyes turned toward the entrance, where a tall figure stepped into the room.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, you're back from seclusion!" Emma exclaimed, her heart racing.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She almost dashed into his arms, but with so many people around, she held herself back.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne flashed her a brief smile. "Yeah, I'm out."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Turning his gaze to the elders, he continued, "It seems you're all rather skeptical about my abilities?"</p></div>
