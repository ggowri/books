        <h1>Chapter 109 Top Family Heir</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young woman, around twenty-two or twenty-three, stood tall with a striking figure. Her delicate features were framed by a round face, making her both beautiful and endearing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Barlyn stepped down from the truck, she rolled her eyes dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Radcliffe, what's this all about? You were so secretive on the phone and wanted me to find a warehouse for a truck? Where's your fancy car? Planning to play poor with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised an eyebrow, adding with a hint of amusement, "Just so you know, I'm not lending you any money. If Ms. Donna Radcliffe finds out I did, I'm toast. So, if you're here for a loan, forget it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn was immediately put on the defensive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked exasperated and retorted, "Austin, do you think I came all the way here just to ask for money? I have plenty of my own."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin shot him a scornful glance. "Oh, really? If you had money, would you be in Mayby City? Save the act. I know you've had your credit card cut off by Ms. Donna Radcliffe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn flushed with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rather than argue, he turned to Osborne and said, "Osborne, let me introduce you. This is Austin, the heir to the Montague family. She's a bit sharp-tongued, but she's been a friend of mine since childhood."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he addressed Austin, "Austin, this is Osborne Augustine, my brother from another mother. Just call him Osborne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Osborne and Austin were taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was surprised to learn that this round-faced girl was indeed an heir to the Montague family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was one of the most formidable families in Mayby City, which surpassed the Ashford family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Montague family dominated shipping with a sprawling dock, dozens of massive freighters, and a fleet of luxury cruise ships worth billions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Osborne's divorce from Ophelia, he often heard members of the Caldwell family mention the Montague family and each time, their tone was filled with utmost respect and envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin was astonished by Barlyn's casual tone and close relationship with Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought to herself, "Who is Barlyn? He's from an old family too, not the heir but still on par with me, an heir to a top-tier family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, he treats Osborne like a lifelong friend?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne must be one of those young masters from some big families."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled, extending her hand to Osborne, "Hello, Osborne. I'm Austin Montague. Just call me Austin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, saying, "Nice to meet you, Austin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn said, opening the truck door with a smug grin, "Alright, let's get down to business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Austin, check this out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin's curiosity piqued; she walked to the back of the truck and gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you didn't rob a bank, did you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn chuckled triumphantly, "No, I'm not that stupid. We only rob a gang leader. There's roughly 300 to 400 million in cash here, plus valuables of equivalent worth. I need you to sort this out, assess its value, and then launder it. The money should be transferred directly to Osborne's account.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm worried that if it goes into my account, my mom might just seize it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin relaxed slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, it's just gang money. As long as it's not from a bank heist, that's fine. I'll get someone to sort and appraise it and then transfer the funds to you once it's all sorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just to be clear, the fee for laundering this amount is ten percent, which is a favor. Normally, it would be thirty percent. The reduced rate is because I'll have the cooperative gang handle it. Can't have them working for nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the ten percent fee, Barlyn grimaced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Barlyn was about to speak, Osborne pulled him back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a friendly grin, Osborne said, "No problem at all! Thanks a lot, Austin. Once everything is settled, we'll take you out for a grand meal and show our appreciation. Without you, we'd have been stuck with this dirty money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin smiled at the praise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shot a sharp look at Barlyn. "See how well Osborne handles people? And look at you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn rolled his eyes in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's your point?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just a fool!" Austin snapped back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two began bickering, their playful argument filled with sharp jabs and laughter. Meanwhile, a group of people arrived to start sorting and valuing the cash and valuables from the truck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took a solid three hours for them to complete the meticulous inventory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cash totaled 350 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The valuables were worth another 400 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Davy's assets amounted to 750 million - far exceeding the liquidity of most top families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As per their agreement, Osborne and Barlyn would split the proceeds, with a total of around 680 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's share was 70%, about 480 million, while Barlyn would get 30%, exactly 200 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Osborne and Barlyn were pleased with the outcome, though they were disappointed that they wouldn't see the money for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, Osborne, Austin, how about we go out for a drink to celebrate?" Barlyn suggested eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin rolled her eyes. "You two made a profit, but I didn't. What's there to celebrate? Seems pointless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled at her words, saying, "Barlyn, Austin, are you interested in making another big score?"</span></p></div>
