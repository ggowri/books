        <h1>Chapter 1158 Mental Disturbance</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Osborne led the group deeper into the rift, covering a distance of about two miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's stop here," he called out, halting everyone in their tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on, Osborne?" Anastasia asked, her brow furrowed with confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne offered a calm smile. "Cillian mentioned that one of his family's elders went mad after venturing two miles in, attacking his own people before falling into the rift. There's something off about this place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne closed his eyes, intently on the atmosphere around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could sense anything, Zoe exclaimed, "Osborne, I'm picking up something!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne turned his attention to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe had her eyes shut, </span><span>but </span><span>her brows knitted in concentration. "I can sense a faint disturbance in mental strength here! For us Class S warriors, it's not much of an issue, but anyone below Class S might be affected and could spiral into madness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She opened her eyes, looking serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And the deeper we go, the stronger that disturbance becomes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression shifted to one of concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt it, too, now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A mental strength disturbance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clearly a form of psychological attack, subtle yet potent. Unless one had exceptionally strong mental fortitude and the ability to tune in to the subtle disturbances, it would</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>be nearly impossible to detect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If someone didn't have strong mental strength, they could easily lose control and go insane without realizing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, the disturbance wasn't strong enough yet to affect the Class S warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aside from Zoe, who had just broken through to Class S, the rest of them were top-tier Class S fighters, and they were immune to the effects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Zoe's mental strength even surpassed Osborne's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's thought, Osborne spoke decisively, "Let's push further and assess the situation. Zoe, keep an eye on that mental disturbance. If you notice a sudden spike in intensity that could affect us, you need to warn us immediately, got it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe nodded vigorously, her excitement bubbling over at the chance to assist Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely, I've got this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, let's move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group of nearly a hundred continued deeper into the rift. Suddenly, over twenty Class S D Dark Exotic Beasts burst forth from the depths, racing toward the exit of the rift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take them down!" Osborne ordered calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of Blood Demon Vanguard sprang into action. A few of them pulled out super energy guns, firing rapidly. The Dark Exotic Beasts didn't stand a chance; they were swiftly eliminated before they could even get close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched in awe as each bullet found its mark, striking the beasts' weak points with astonishing precision. The marksmanship was nothing short of miraculous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling a rush of nostalgia, Osborne couldn't resist the urge to join in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been ages since he'd fired a gun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled out his super energy gun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they pushed deeper, they </span><span>met</span><span> more groups of Dark Exotic Beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and the Blood Demon Vanguard members competed to see who could take down the most beasts with their super energy guns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After several rounds of combat, they had taken down over a hundred Dark Exotic Beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gather</span><span>ed</span><span> a significant amount of blood energy</span><span> from them</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he caught sight of the bottom of the rift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had descended over 12 miles </span><span>underground</span><span>, surrounded by </span><span>complete</span><span> darkness and an energy density at least ten times greater than what they experienced above ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Training here would be exponentially more effective&mdash;ten times faster than anywhere else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the mental disturbances in the area were terrifying. Even an ordinary Class S could easily fall victim to this mental </span><span>attack</span><span>, leading to madness without them even realizing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, they reached the bottom of the fissure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what lay before them was </span><span>nothing</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only a few fragmented bones were scattered around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just because they were at the bottom didn't mean the fissure was over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three enormous, dark passageways loomed ahead, twisting and turning into the unknown depths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe suddenly cried out, "Osborne, the mental disturbances are even stronger here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With this level of mental turmoil, even top-tier Class S warriors wouldn't last long before succumbing to madness!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have to get out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You mean even the elite Class S warriors can't withstand this? </span><span>Are</span><span> we supposed to back off now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned tightly, frustration gnawing at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't had a chance to fully explore the fissure yet, and the thought of retreating was far from satisfactory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Osborne was weighing his options, a sudden change crossed his face as he glanced down one of the passageways.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get ready for battle! A massive horde is coming&mdash;at least 300 Class S Dark Exotic Beasts! Some of them are even </span><span>equal</span><span> with top-tier Class S!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words sent shockwaves of alarm through the group.</span></p></div>
