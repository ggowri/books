        <h1>Chapter 1405 Squad From the Ninth Dark Deity Legion</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia exchanged a glance, their faces etched with hesitation, conflict, and even despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Make up your minds! I think the Ninth Dark Deity Legion will be here soon. The villagers, trying to earn some brownie points, have probably already contacted them and spilled everything. If we don't leave now, we might not get another chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's words sent a wave of panic through Harry and Amelia, but it quickly turned to resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had made their decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry sighed, "We don't have much of a choice. Even if we hide in the mine, the Ninth Dark Deity Legion will eventually find us. But we can try to live one more day. We'll gather what we need and leave right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry was still pessimistic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't think hiding in the mine would do much good, but he couldn't bear the thought of giving up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Escaping the mine was out of the question, and surviving in the wild was impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't argue. Once the siblings were ready, the three of them headed straight for the mine, quickly vanishing into its depths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after they left, a terrifying aura suddenly enveloped Rodriguez Village. A domineering figure landed with a loud thud, his eyes scanning the area and taking in the numerous bodies on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression was cold and ruthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! </span><span>So</span><span> it's true&mdash;someone dared to kill a member of the Ninth Dark Deity Legion! Even if it was just a reserve member, it's been years since anyone had the guts to do such a thing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smirked. "All of you, get out here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire village trembled as the villagers slowly emerged, walking toward the </span><span>middle-aged man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lord Squad Leader, we greet you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lord Squad Leader, we greet you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The villagers saluted neatly, their faces a mix of terror and trepidation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man before them was not just any reserve member like Patrick; he was a full-fledged member of the Ninth Dark Deity Legion and the captain of a ten-man squad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a powerful figure could decide the fate of the entire village with a single word, and it had been years since someone of his caliber had visited a place as small as Rodriguez Village. Their fear was justified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's voice was icy cold. "My name is Lachlan Swift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Patrick and I were from the same village. Now he's dead, and I need to know who had the audacity to do this. Tell me everything you saw, or the whole village will pay with their lives for Patrick's death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lachlan's chilling intent hung over every villager, making them shake uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, they vied to recount what they had witnessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lachlan sneered. "A stranger, you say?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne? If he could kill Patrick and nearly twenty Intermediate Deities, he must be at least a top-tier Superior Deity, maybe even close to a Transcendent Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But to take on a reserve member of the Ninth Dark Deity Legion with such strength? That's just begging for death. No matter where you're hiding, you're as good as dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lachlan's eyes blazed with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, another wave of powerful presences surged in, and nine formidable, arrogant figures descended upon the Rodriguez Village, each radiating an aura of overwhelming strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them was far more powerful than the deceased Patrick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of them were top-tier Superior Deities!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Zone Nine, humans could indeed join the Ninth Dark Deity Legion, but the requirements were significantly higher than for ordinary Dark Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While a Dark Deity only needed to reach the Superior Deity level to join, humans had to become Transcendent Deities at the very least.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lachlan's squad of ten was composed of nine Dark Deities, all Superior Deities, and himself, the only human and a Transcendent Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, all the perimeter sensing devices around the mine are activated! From now on, nobody's slipping out without being noticed. What's the plan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nine Dark Deities turned to Lachlan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lachlan snorted coldly, saying, "They'll be hiding deep in the mines, thinking they can escape our search. Pathetic fools!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Use the sensing devices to flush them out! I'll personally rip them apart, skin by skin, and hang their bones on the village gates of every settlement around here. I want everyone to know the dire consequences of killing a member of the Ninth Dark Deity Legion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Lachlan's gaze fell upon the mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hiding deep in the mines? Thinking you're safe? In less than a day, I'll have you </span><span>cornered! But first..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lachlan waved a hand dismissively as he added, "Wipe out the Rodriguez Village! These cowards watched Patrick die without lifting a finger. They all deserve to die! Kill them all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nine obliged instantly, and the villagers of Rodriguez Village erupted into panicked screams, but it was futile. They were soon slaughtered to the last soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the nine followed Lachlan toward the mine, one of them holding a radiant device known as the Spirit Tracer.</span></p></div>
