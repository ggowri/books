        <h1>Chapter 107 Treasure House</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the center of the massive vault, two towering piles of cash stood like mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stacks of bills, looking more like bricks than paper, filled the space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and Barlyn were both awestruck by the sheer scale of the scene before them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my, how much money is this?" Barlyn gasped, his eyes lighting up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snapped back to reality, doing a quick mental calculation. "Probably around 300 to 400 million dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only 300 to 400 million?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn was clearly disappointed. As the heir of an ancient family, 300 to 400 hundred million would had been a drop in the bucket if it weren't for Donna controlling his credit cards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't have a real grasp of how much 300 or 400 hundred million really meant until now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact of seeing it in cash was far greater than seeing just numbers on an account.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, pulling together that much cash was beyond what most wealthy families could manage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon enough, Barlyn's excitement returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three or 300 or 400 million in cash, and if I get to keep 30 percent of it, that's at least 100 million for me! Osborne, you really weren't lying. That guy is just a small-time gangster boss. He managed to get his hands on this much money?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "I wouldn't be surprised if there's even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In addition to the cash, there's a ton of valuables - antiques, paintings, jewelry, gems. All those could easily be worth another 300 or 400 million."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, Barlyn's enthusiasm soared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So I might end up with 200 million? Haha, I'll finally be free from my mom's threats!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are we waiting for? Let's start moving!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn geared up to get to work. But as he looked at the mountain of cash and treasures, he realized he was at a loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was just too much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just that cash would require dozens of bags - each 100 million weighing about 2200 pounds. So, the total weight of the cash alone would be 6600 to 8800 pounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With all the other valuables, it was clear that moving it all with just the two of them would be a Herculean task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn suddenly appreciated why Osborne had brought a truck - it was essential for moving all this loot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How are we going to move this?" Barlyn asked, a hint of frustration in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "If we have enough time, we can empty the vault with ease, but we clearly don't have that luxury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Davy has undoubtedly gotten word and is likely bringing reinforcements; Maelstrom is one of the largest gangs in Mayby City, with over a thousand members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Davy returns with a few hundred men, can the two of us take them all out? Quite impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We are running out of time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It looks like I have to reveal my ability."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne then said, "Barlyn, you handle the lookout at the entrance. Make sure no one gets close. I'll take care of the moving."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn nodded. "Got it! But are you sure you can handle it alone? Maybe I should help out. We can move those out as many as possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn winced at the thought of not being able to leave the vault empty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "No need. I've got this covered. You wouldn't be able to do much more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Activating Satan's Eye, he enveloped one of the cash mountains with his ocular energy. With a thought, the pile of cash - at least 50 million, weighing half 1100 pounds - lifted into the air as if held by an invisible hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It sped out of the vault and headed straight for the truck at the entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn watched in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He exclaimed, "Mind control?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you're a mind control metahuman? But wait, this mind control is insane! Moving something that weighs at least 1100 pounds with mind control - how is that even possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "It's not exactly mind control, though it's somewhat similar. Enough talk. Get to the door and make sure no one wrecks our truck. Or we'll end up empty-handed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn snapped back to focus, his excitement barely contained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it! I'll make sure no one touches our truck. Anyone who tries will have to deal with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Barlyn dashed out of the vault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued to use his ocular energy to move the cash. Each sweep of his power transported about 50 million dollars. After eight trips, the vault was finally empty of cash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then turned to the other valuables.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other treasures were even heavier, but Osborne was determined not to leave anything behind for Davy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Barlyn stood guard by the truck, his excitement growing as he watched the pile of treasures increase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, an eight or nine-year-old boy wandered over, curiosity lighting up his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn called out, "Hey, kid, stay back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This place is dangerous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The boy didn't move, continuing to watch with fascination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn hesitated but ultimately decided to ignore him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, it was just a kid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as Barlyn looked away, the boy's face hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he pulled a gun from his jacket and aimed directly at Barlyn's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're stealing from Maelstrom? You're dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he pulled the trigger.</span></p></div>
