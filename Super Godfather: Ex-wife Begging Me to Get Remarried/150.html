        <h1>Chapter 150 Do You Have X-Ray Vision</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne got excited. Knowing that Zoe knew where Hyena Gang was made things much simpler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The southern slums were incredibly complex. An ordinary person could easily get lost there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially now, on a pitch-dark night, finding Hyena Gang and Raymond was far more complicated than Osborne had anticipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's great! Lead the way to Hyena Gang."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe nodded vigorously. "Follow me, Osborne! There are three gangs around here. It would be troublesome if we took a wrong turn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, she smeared some mud on her face, rubbing vigorously to cover her pretty features with grime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are a lot of jerks around here. To avoid trouble, I usually disguise myself as ugly. Just before going to bed tonight, I washed up, which is why those scoundrels from Scorpion Gang noticed me. Luckily, you saved me, Osborne, or I wouldn't have survived."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, his expression somber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was also an orphan and had wandered homeless, so he understood all too well how difficult it was for a girl like Zoe to survive up to this point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She must have suffered a lot and faced many hardships!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, she remained optimistic, which was truly remarkable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zoe, don't worry. After tonight, you won't have to come back to this dreadful place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Zoe fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, she spoke, "Osborne, not everyone here is bad. There are more good people than bad. They are just driven by their circumstances, just poor! During the years I've lived here, many have helped me. When I'm capable, I will definitely return to help them change their situation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne paused and then nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My bad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe smiled faintly, and then whispered, "Osborne, we are about to enter Hyena Gang's territory! Hyena Gang has hundreds of members, mostly pickpockets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Recently, I don't know what's happened, but they've stopped stealing and have barricaded this area. No one can get close."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe finished speaking, and Osborne got excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When did this start?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"About a month and a half ago, I guess?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe recalled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne got even more excited. A month and a half ago was exactly when Raymond first attacked Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed Raymond really was here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne activated Satan's Eye and peered ahead, his vision piercing through one house after another, searching for Raymond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Strangely, he couldn't find him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Zoe said, he saw many Hyena Gang members, seemingly on alert, but he saw no one unusual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nor could he spot Raymond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had seen Raymond before and could recognize him instantly with his X-ray vision. Even a disguise would be futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could he not be here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, suspecting that Raymond might have received advance notice, and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed the plan had to be canceled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sighed, and since he couldn't find Raymond, he prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Osborne about to leave, Zoe looked puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, aren't we here to find someone? We haven't even gone in yet. Why are you leaving?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head. "I've already looked. The person I'm searching for isn't here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh? You looked?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe froze, then her face flushed red, and she whispered uncertainly, "Osborne, you... Do you have X-ray vision?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Zoe's blushing face, he felt embarrassed and quickly said, "No! What are you thinking? How could I possibly have X-ray vision? No one has X-ray vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What I meant is, I can sense that person's presence, and he's not in the houses ahead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, I see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe patted her chest, still blushing, and said, "I thought you had X-ray vision. That would mean... That would mean..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne awkwardly touched his nose, swearing in his heart that he must never let anyone know he possesses X-ray vision or that any woman around him would never be able to face him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Osborne was restrained and generally did not use X-ray vision to peer at their bodies, just knowing he had X-ray vision would make others distrust him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In any case, he must never reveal his X-ray vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe thought for a moment and said, "Osborne, maybe the person you're looking for is hiding underground? I once heard that the Hyena Gang had dug many tunnels underground to smuggle drugs and hide weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could that person be hiding in those tunnels?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Osborne froze and got excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't checked the underground yet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked again and saw some hidden tunnels below, which became increasingly complex the deeper they went, like an underground maze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but be amazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, he got excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Found him!"</span></p></div>
