        <h1>Chapter 180 The Powerful Defense System</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apollo really went rogue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That bastard, he doesn't even have us in his eyes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna was furious. Apollo had forced his way in as she expected, and she was angry but helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Chevalier family was indeed stronger than the Radcliffe family now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could only hope that the defense system would actually stop Apollo's intrusion and teach him a lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin smiled, "Ms. Donna Radcliffe, you can rest assured. Unless Apollo has Class A strength, otherwise, he won't be able to force his way in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna felt much more at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Is Apollo possibly a Class A powerhouse? Absolutely not. He's too young.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Class A powerhouses are absolute super experts in the entire Rosmandi country, which is extremely rare. Even worldwide, they are considered big shots. No matter how strong Apollo is, he can't be Class A, not even Class B+."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she didn't fully trust Valentin and had to witness the system's power herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn exclaimed, catching Donna's attention. The Radcliffe family's warning team couldn't stop Apollo's forceful entry, being pushed aside brutally as he strode into the Radcliffe Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they entered the Radcliffe Manor, a powerful voice sounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Warning! You have invaded private property. Please stop the intrusion immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Warning! You have invaded private property. Please stop the intrusion immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo was stunned, then sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved his hand and ordered, "So what if it's private property? Keep going. Anyone who dares to stop us, take them down. I'll take any consequences."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group of burly men behind him got excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. We are the elite members of Chevalier Security. Do they think they could stop us? That's a joke."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Chevalier, please step back and let us clear the way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group of burly men rushed to the front, eager to perform in front of Apollo. They tightened their grip on their weapons, ready for battle. Their faces were full of ferocity as if anyone who dared to stop them would be crushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring the warnings, they continued to delve deeper into the Radcliffe Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the warning voice stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Intruder detected, initiating blocking mission."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next second, a group of robots appeared in front of Apollo, all equipped with weapons, aiming at Apollo and his group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please stop the intrusion immediately." The robots blocked Apollo's path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take them apart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo ordered, and the burly men cheered loudly. Without hesitation, they raised their gun barrels and fired at the robots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bullet rain attack hit the robots, but they didn't dodge, letting the bullets hit their shells and making clanging sounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attack detected, initiating counterattack. Fire." The robots started to fight back, their gun barrels spewing out dense flames, countless bullets like a torrent, instantly enveloping Apollo and his group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shit!" The burly men were startled, not expecting the robots' shells to be so sturdy. Their shooting not only didn't dismantle the robots but felt like tickling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the robots' firepower was far more ferocious than theirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, they were completely suppressed. They hid behind cover, not even daring to peek out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the monitoring room, Donna, Barlyn, and a few others opened their mouths wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin smiled and said, "Ms. Donna Radcliffe, these are our armed defense robots made entirely of the toughest Type A alloy. Not even ordinary rifles, large-caliber sniper rifles, or even rocket launchers can easily destroy them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And their weapons are as powerful as Class B individual rifles from the Draco Group, capable of easily killing Class C martial artists, even threatening Class B powerhouses. If they set up a shooting network together, even Class B experts wouldn't dare to force their way in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are twenty of these armed robots."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna took a deep breath, nodding excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But just this, I'm afraid it won't stop a Class B powerhouse's invasion, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin was full of confidence. "Of course, this is just the beginning." He gestured for them to continue watching. Dozens of armed drones began to take off, arriving above Apollo and his group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were also equipped with weapons, aiming at the enemies. Apollo and his group, hiding behind cover, were completely exposed under their gun barrels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group's faces changed dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shoot them down," Apollo shouted. Everyone started firing wildly. Their marksmanship was excellent, and even drones hundreds of feet high were constantly being hit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, the drones' shells were incredibly sturdy and remained unaffected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next second, the gun barrels underneath the drones glowed brightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attack poured down instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? It's energy weapons."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn, get out quickly."</span></p></div>
