        <h1>Chapter 1426 Now!</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Energy level forty-eight?" Osborne murmured, his mind racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew the squad leader's device was a type of Spirit Tracer, specifically designed to detect the energy signatures of Deathborn within a few miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The higher the reading, the greater the number and strength of Deathborn nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Based on their past experiences, a reading of forty-eight indicated there were likely more than ten Transcendent Deity Deathborns and over a hundred Superior Deity Deathborns in the vicinity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forty-eight, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Jeffrey's brow furrowed slightly, a flicker of concern crossing his face. The sheer number and strength of the Deathborn was more than he had anticipated, leaving him in a bit of a bind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He faced a critical decision: stay and eliminate this horde of Deathborn or retreat immediately to call for reinforcements, waiting for backup before tackling the threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forty-eight isn't that big of a deal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deathborns are just mindless, stupid creatures. With our team's strength, we can take them down without breaking a sweat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want to waste time waiting for backup, and I certainly don't want to be the laughingstock of the other centurions for being a coward. So, I'm sticking to the original battle plan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Any objections?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey's gaze swept over the ten squad leaders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"None here! We'll take care of all the Deathborn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Count me in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, the more intense the battle, the better. The more Deathborns came, the stronger they were, the more he could gain. If Jeffrey and the others dispatched the Deathborn easily, he'd be sorely disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he needed was the high-grade death scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Deathborns that fell, the more he could collect, and with enough high-grade death scent, he could restore the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, boosting his own power significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the moment was right, he wouldn't hesitate to strike against Jeffrey and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hope it's a real slugfest," Osborne thought to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy fluctuations of the Deathborn drew nearer, and soon they materialized in the underground space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne spotted shadowy figures rushing toward the center, where the Soul Resonance Fluid lay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The number of shadows multiplied rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within moments, hundreds of them appeared, still in their ethereal forms. As they approached the Soul Resonance Fluid, they transformed into solid entities, lunging forward in a frenzy to claim the precious substance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the Deathborn, the Soul Resonance Fluid was the ultimate feast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now!" Jeffrey barked, his voice cutting through the tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost a hundred warriors surged forward simultaneously, unleashing a torrent of prepared attacks toward the cluster of Deathborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne joined in, but he didn't go all out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he mimicked Lachlan's attack style. Although Lachlan was a Transcendent Deity, he lacked the finesse that Osborne possessed. Lachlan had awakened his Thunder Power at a young age but never truly mastered it; his lightning elemental essence was still quite basic, merely enhancing his divine power without depth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Osborne, who had already mastered Thunder Power, mimicking Lachlan's technique was a piece of cake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even those closest to Lachlan wouldn't detect anything amiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With nearly a hundred warriors striking at once, the force unleashed was terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them were six Transcendent Deity warriors, with the rest being Superior Deity fighters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, their combined onslaught wreaked havoc on the Deathborn swarm, which was too busy scrambling for the Soul Resonance Fluid to defend itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched intently as at least twenty Superior Deity Deathborns fell to their initial onslaught, each killed instantly, their forms dissolving into rich, potent, high-grade death scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of exhilaration surged through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in the No. 3 mining area, he had spent countless hours delving into the deepest shafts, hoping to encounter even a handful of Deathborns. With his Satan's Eye, spotting just one or two Superior Deity Deathborns a day had seemed like a stroke of luck, and the rate at which he could restore the Lotus had been agonizingly slow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, in mere moments, twenty of them had been slain, leaving a bounty of high-grade death scent in their wake. If he could channel this essence into the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, its recovery would be monumental.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, that recovery would translate directly into Osborne regaining his own strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gazed longingly at the swirling clouds of high-grade death scent, barely able to contain his excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, it wasn't just him who was eager&mdash;the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was practically quaking in anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if sensing the rich essence in the air, the Lotus stirred, its tendrils emerging from Osborne's body, stretching outward hungrily to absorb the death scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, being an energy entity, the roots of the Lotus were intangible and formless&mdash;just a faint wisp of energy. In the chaos of battle, everyone else was too busy taking out the remaining Deathborns to notice anything strange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It soaked the high-grade death scent all in!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this frenzied atmosphere, the Lotus feasted without restraint on the high-grade death scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne could feel the energy flowing through him, a swift and invigorating sensation as the Lotus absorbed the essence, accelerating its recovery.</span></p></div>
