        <h1>Chapter 158 Betrayal</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Clarissa approached and treated those who were lying on the ground, they suddenly stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ten people surrounded Clarissa in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Clarissa could react, one of them put a sharp alloy dagger on her neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Harris, who was standing behind Donna, suddenly punched her hard on the back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harris' strength was far inferior to Donna's, but he was a Class D+ martial artist. The power of his punch was strong. Donna was caught off guard. How could her fragile body withstand such a hard attack?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna vomited blood and fell to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was pale, and she was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that she had not come to her senses. She saw Harris taking his gun. He aimed at her head and prepared to pull the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell, bitch!" Harris shouted ferociously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Barlyn finally reacted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He watched Harris launch a surprise attack and try to shoot his mother, but his mother seemed dazed. He suddenly became angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved his hand, and an earth wall instantly appeared in front of Donna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bullet hit the wall, making a muffled sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of Clarissa's Personal Guards finally reacted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They took their guns, aimed at Harris, and prepared to fight back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Harris immediately flashed to Clarissa and pointed a gun at her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted, "If you don't want her to die now, stop it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's Personal Guards panicked. Looking at Clarissa, who was being controlled, they dared not shoot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna came to her senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood up with difficulty and looked at Clarissa, who was being controlled. She was trembling all over, looking furious, and she clenched her fists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna growled, "Harris, how dare you betray us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you attack Clarissa? You are courting death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harris sneered, "Donna, don't scare me. I'm timid. If I get scared, I may accidentally pull the trigger and blow up Ms. Radcliffe's head. You don't want to see this, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna was stunned, and her eyes were full of worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harris continued, "Betray you? Humph, how can you say that? I'm not a member of the Radcliffe family. I'm just an employer. You pay me, and I work for you. That's all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone has given me more money than I can spend in the rest of my life. I just made a right choice. It's not a betrayal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna's face became even angrier when she heard what Harris said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harris said coldly, "Don't blame me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you let me be the bodyguard captain, why would I do this? You actually let a newcomer be my superior and give me orders. What right does he have? He actually targeted me and didn't give me any opportunity to make money!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In that case, I will make you pay the price!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You even wanted to take action. I contacted the Aberrants and destroyed your plan. I didn't expect that they would even promise to give me a large sum of money. How can I refuse such a good deal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Harris finished speaking, he looked arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Asshole!" Barlyn could not help but curse. "If you dare to hurt Clarissa, I'll kill you. With the people of the Bodyguard Unit Two, you can't run away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harris sneered but said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a man laughed. "You are too confident. Since we knew your plan, how could we not have made arrangements? You have no chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, two people from the Bodyguard Unit Two stood out with sneers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Donna was stunned. "Aren't you from the second Bodyguard Unit? You... You are metahumans!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man said, "Let me introduce myself. I'm Hammond Alvarado, a Class C+ plant-controlling metahuman. The one next to me is my brother, Harland Alvarado, a Class C+ martial artist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for the others, they are all shape-shifting metahumans, werewolves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Hammond finished speaking, the eight men roared. Their bodies began to swell, and they were covered with black hair, transforming into werewolves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this situation, Donna widened her eyes in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Class C+ plant-controlling metahuman and a Class C+ martial artist?" This situation was tough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was restraint between elemental powers. The earth elemental restrained the plant elemental.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Donna was not injured, and her power was in peak condition, it would be difficult for her to defeat a plant-controlling metahuman of the same level, and she would probably even lose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was seriously injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, there was also a Class C+ martial artist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could she fight against them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Donna, Barlyn, the Personal Guards, and bodyguards, they were no match for Hammond and Harland at all. What was more, Harris controlled Clarissa, making them hesitant to act rashly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill Clarissa first!" Hammond suddenly said.</span></p></div>
