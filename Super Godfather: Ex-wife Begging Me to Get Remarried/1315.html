        <h1>Chapter 1314 Crushing Dominance</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's breakthrough was complete; he now stood at the pinnacle of Superior Deity, with the third Divine Flame crowning his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight sent </span><span>shock-waves</span><span> through Terrence, Divine Shadow, and the God of Star.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence's astonishment was palpable as his expression turned grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impossible! What kind of forbidden art could leap an entire realm?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To actually achieve Superior Deity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is bad news for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence knew he was in dire straits. Osborne's ascension to Superior Deity made him a true threat, negating any advantage Terrence once held.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what truly shook him was Osborne's aura&mdash;it was still growing stronger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can he keep getting stronger?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence's composure wavered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't fathom what secret technique Osborne had used to achieve such a colossal boost in power. "Doesn't he fear crippling his own potential?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne harbored no such fears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't employed any forbidden technique&mdash;he'd simply borrowed strength through the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity from the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Already, he'd reached the mid-stage of Superior Deity, with each Blood Demon member providing roughly a third of their power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If all four thousand eight hundred Blood Demon members lent me their full strength, I might reach the peak of Superior Deity or even break through to Transcendent Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there's no need for that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Superior Deity mid-stage is more than enough to deal with Terrence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne ceased absorbing power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His divine power swelled as he coldly eyed Terrence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Terrence, let's resume our fight. This time, I'm curious to see how you plan to beat me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Face darkening, Terrence clenched his teeth. "Osborne, resorting to such a potent strength-enhancing technique, aren't you worried about your potential? You must really crave my demise, huh?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But even if you've reached Superior Deity, it won't be enough. How long can this boost last anyway?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A calm smile appeared on Osborne's face. "That's none of your concern. I think it won't be too difficult to defeat you now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence seethed. "Arrogant fool! Even as a Superior Deity, you're still leagues beneath me. What makes you think you can win? Not difficult, you say? This is a joke!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes narrowed, his body brimming with overwhelming power eager to unleash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's test that theory! Fight me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Utilizing the same tactic, he halted time, appearing behind Terrence. This time, Terrence was ensnared for over a second, ample time for Osborne to amass his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Terrence snapped back, Osborne's boot collided with his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force shattered Terrence's divine power defenses, cleaving his Divine Body with destructive impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence was propelled forward, spewing blood, eyes wide with shock and fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His defenses had crumbled, and it had been effortless for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was equally taken aback. He'd known his Superior Deity status would weaken Terrence's defenses but hadn't anticipated the ease of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence's Divine Body was gravely injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's smile turned cold as he spoke. "Terrence, your time is up! You're the last of the Deschanel Clan. Save yourself the struggle and join your kin in oblivion. I can't afford to leave any loose ends."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence wiped the blood from his lips, eyes burning with frenzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! I can't die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Deschanel Clan can't be wiped out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have to become a Deity King! We must rise to be the mightiest clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I refuse to perish here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will defeat you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a fit of desperation, Terrence launched himself at Osborne, unleashing every ounce of his divine power with ferocious abandon. His attacks were wild and formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Divine Shadow's expression hardened, and she quickly warned Osborne, "Osborne, be careful! He's going all out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne merely chuckled, "Going all out, are you? Too late! Maybe if I were still an Intermediate Deity, your reckless assault might work. But now, I'm a Superior Deity. You don't stand a chance! Prepare to fall!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Choosing not to dodge, Osborne met Terrence's attack head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After just three exchanges, Terrence lay bloodied on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his all-out assault, he could only withstand three moves from this temporarily ascended Superior Deity before his Divine Body was nearly shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lay motionless, his eyes filled with despair and regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow and God of Star, watching from a distance, were dumbstruck. A glance shared between them reflected their shared shock and fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was overwhelmingly powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing Osborne as he was now, their fate would likely be the same&mdash;or even worse than Terrence's!</span></p></div>
