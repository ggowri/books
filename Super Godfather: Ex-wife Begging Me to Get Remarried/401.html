        <h1>Chapter 401 I Owe You</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had unconsciously already touched Isa's body all over with both hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa kept her eyes closed and didn't resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was so excited that he carried her and gently placed her on the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was breathing quickly, and he was as audacious as he could be at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as he was about to go further, a surprised voice suddenly rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, Ms. Bowin, what are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's voice suddenly rang out in the hallway. Before Osborne could react, he instantly felt pushed out by Isa. He was hit straight on the ceiling and fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa blushed and said quickly, "I'd like to teach Osborne some more combat skills."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saying that, Isa bit her lip and glared at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne felt that Isa's eyes were no longer imposing at this moment. Not only would he not be frightened, but he had an urge to keep hugging and kissing Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe was already to go downstairs, so of course he couldn't do that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hurriedly fixed his messy clothes and said, "Yes, I'm asking Isa to teach me some advanced skills. I could never learn it, so Isa had to teach me personally."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne couldn't help but feel embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa was also embarrassed, and she gave Osborne another glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe just saw Osborne on Isa's body and being kicked out by Isa, and she thought Isa was really teaching Osborne some combat skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nodded and smiled, "I'm not interrupting, am I? You may continue, and I'll go upstairs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's face turned even more flushed when Zoe finished speaking, and she gritted her teeth at Osborne as if to say, "Just wait and see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't dare to stay here, so he said hurriedly, "No need. I've already learned it, and I just have to go get busy with something. Zoe, you need to learn from Isa, and don't slack off, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne picked up the Bronze Mirror and ran for the door as fast as he could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said quickly as he ran, in a voice only Isa could hear, "Isa, now I owe you ten minutes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll give it back to you next time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saying that, Osborne had already rushed out of the mansion's door, and his words instantly made Isa clench her fists, even her neck flushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard, I'm going to beat you to death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who wants you to owe me ten minutes? Also, did we just kiss for ten minutes?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I feel like it was just a couple seconds!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa yelled, but her roar sounded as loud as a mosquito's buzz even to her own ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne walked away from the mansion, making sure Isa wasn't catching up before he finally breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "I was too audacious just now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could have been killed by Isa! Fortunately, it didn't turn out that way. It wasn't something I initiated, so Isa wouldn't be angry, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it was hard to say. She was a witch, and her temper made me puzzled. I kissed her this time, but if she suddenly can't figure it out, I'm going to suffer!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's body is so nice to touch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking about it, Osborne quickly shook his head and suppressed all his thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, it was already dark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's time for me to get on the ship! I hope Isa won't be angry anymore when I get off the ship."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about it, Osborne walked towards the harbor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, the harbor was bustling with activity. Eighteen cruise ships of the Augustine family had been repaired and were all docked in the harbor, waiting for tourists to board them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rich people from all over the world started to board the ships.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost everyone in the Augustine family was present to maintain order, and they had to make sure that every tourist who bought a ticket could board the ship without any problems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained busy in this way until eight o'clock in the evening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the whistles of eighteen cruise ships sounded one after the other, and the tourists who had filled them set sail once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne boarded a large cruise ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the Alisa ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's room was still a VIP suite on the fifteenth floor, but most of the tickets had been sold this time. Even though Osborne was the heir to the Augustine family, he wouldn't occupy a suite alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would have to squeeze into the suite with Ryan, Nathan, Kaden, Queenie, and Yulissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, Queenie and Yulissa would share a room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne would live in a room alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan, Nathan and Kaden didn't want to be squeezed into a room with Osborne anyway, so they all chose to sleep in the living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't force them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had a lot of secrets, and it was true that he couldn't be disturbed while he practiced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne didn't rush his cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He called Valentin over immediately, and Valentin, representing the Skyefall Security Services, signed a security agreement with the Augustine family, and it became the main security force of the cruise ships of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the members of Skyefall Security Services were involved, bringing all sorts of high-tech equipment just to make sure that the Maritime Auction went off without a hitch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne called Valentin in to ask about the defense layout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Valentin, give me a copy of your defense layout. l need to know about your defense arrangement," Osborne told Valentin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin nodded. "Okay, I'm ready! In order to make sure that this Maritime Auction will be held without a hitch, I've brought all the battle droids and battle drones from the warehouse, and I'll be monitoring and defending a six-mile radius of the flotilla with close surveillance and defense. I promise I won't make it easy for anyone to break through the defense circle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Valentin handed Osborne a copy of the defense layout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Ryan, along with Nathan and the others, looked over curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled gently and quickly picked it up.</span></p></div>
