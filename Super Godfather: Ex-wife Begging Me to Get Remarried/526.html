        <h1>Chapter 526 The Sixth Heir's Test</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sixth heir's test was now live.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The challenge was that as a branch bloodline member, he should infiltrate the Augustine family's main bloodline in Newport City and defeat all the potential heirs to become the primary heir of the Augustine family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne read the requirements of the sixth test multiple times, his face a mixture of astonishment and disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He couldn't shake the feeling that he must have missed something, but no, the challenge was indeed as stated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The task seemed surprisingly straightforward&mdash;defeat all the Augustine family's potential heirs and become the top heir.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is it really just about beating all the potential heirs to become the main heir? This doesn't sound that hard," Osborne murmured to himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had expected Godfather to throw him into some grand battle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But soon, a serious look took over his face. The path to becoming the primary heir might be just as grueling as participating in a full-scale war.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His competitors were formidable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Serena had once told him that there were four potential heirs in the Augustine family: Vincent, Matthew, Owen, and Emma.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of these, Vincent was the strongest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent, at forty-five, was the oldest of the younger generation. His talent had been impressive; twenty years ago, at the age of twenty-five, he became a Class A Power Master. Although he achieved this status later than most, his power surged rapidly afterward, making him nearly unfathomable now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rumor had it that Vincent's Satan's Eye had mutated, making it far more potent than usual and nearing level seven. He was considered the most likely candidate to break through to level six soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is Vincent Class AA or Class AAA? If he's AAA, I'm in real trouble," Osborne thought, a shadow of worry crossing his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had a gut feeling that Vincent would be his toughest opponent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Vincent wasn't his only challenge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Matthew, at thirty-eight, was also formidable. His talent was even greater than Vincent's. By twenty-two, he was already a Power Master and practiced martial arts as well, achieving martial master status.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His Satan's Eye had reached level six.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Among the younger generation, only Vincent surpassed Matthew, who, too, was a force to be reckoned with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next were Owen and Emma.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen, thirty-one, was someone Osborne had faced before. He was undoubtedly Class AA, specializing in mind control and Thunder Power, with at least intermediate mastery of Thunder Explosion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if Osborne played all his cards, he doubted he could match Owen's strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, Owen probably hadn't used his full power.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen's mother was the heiress of another old family in Newport City. He inherited exceptional talents from both parents, possessing both Satan's Eye and another power that he had yet to reveal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Owen's already this strong, but he still lags behind Vincent and Matthew, and might even be weaker than Emma."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma, the youngest potential heir at twenty-five, was Osborne's age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Legend had it she became a Class A Power Master before she turned twenty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma's mother was shrouded in mystery, but her talent was acknowledged as the greatest in the Augustine family. Although Emma hadn't awakened her Satan's Eye, it was said she possessed at least three powers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At twenty-five, Emma's achievements were already extraordinary, and her position as a potential heir was a testament to her exceptional abilities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Another mysterious and tough opponent," Osborne thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A headache formed as he realized that, among the four potential heirs, Owen seemed to be the least challenging.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even when facing Owen, Osborne was uncertain of his chances.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The most pressing issue was that each of the four main contenders had substantial backing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Osborne had nothing&mdash;absolutely nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne thought, "And the competition isn't just from the main bloodline of the Augustine family. I'm also up against the prodigies from the Augustine family's branch bloodlines. With eight different branches, each likely harboring their own geniuses, they're all my rivals."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Becoming the first heir of the Augustine family under such fierce competition would be no easier than winning a war.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne sighed deeply at the thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "Of course, the Godfather's trials for the heir are never straightforward! What seems like a simple test is actually fraught with unimaginable difficulty and danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But I must complete the trials!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Osborne's eyes hardened, showing a resolve as cold as steel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wondered, "If I can just pass the sixth trial, I'll be able to get Anastasia into the Godfather's medical research lab! Her rare disease can finally be treated!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But time is running out. Anastasia has less than six months left. That means I have to complete the sixth trial within that timeframe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No matter who tries to stop me, they're my enemies!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Osborne left the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since the Godfather had set such a trial, it meant that the selection of the Augustine family's heir was imminent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Right now, Osborne knew almost nothing about the Augustine family in Newport City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He needed to get there as soon as possible to start preparing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Conveniently, the Godfather's eightieth birthday was just seven days away, so Osborne planned to arrive early to get a feel for the situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the same time, he wanted to have a private meeting with the Godfather to ask about his parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll head to Newport City tomorrow!"</p></div>
