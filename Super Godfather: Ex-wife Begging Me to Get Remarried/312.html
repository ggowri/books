        <h1>Chapter 312 Rapid Improvement</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two days later, the blood diamond in Osborne's hand suddenly cracked and shattered into fine gravel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He absorbed all of the unique energy within the blood diamond completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, the effect was that the soul of powers within Osborne's body had strengthened at least twofold compared to two days ago. Although it hadn't reached Class B+, it was very close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The soul of powers of a metahuman resided in a peculiar region within the body that could not be detected by any advanced equipment. However, it was undeniably real and present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the perception of a metahuman, it was an incredibly vast space without boundaries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took on various forms, each unique based on the specific abilities they mastered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For example, the soul of powers of a fire elemental metahuman would most likely be a sea of flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a metahuman with lightning elemental, it could be a sea of thunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For those with gravity power, his soul of powers was a black shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And for the shape-shifting, his soul of powers might be a magnified version of himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The size of the soul of powers was directly related to the power of the metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Generally, when a metahuman first broke through to Class B, their soul of powers would be about the size of an average adult. As their abilities further developed and grew stronger, their soul of powers would also increase in size.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Class B+ metahumans, the size of their soul of powers would be at least 30 feet tall. Some exceptionally powerful metahumans, when they broke through to Class B+, could even have a soul of powers reaching up to 98 feet in height.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's soul of powers was a phantom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The phantom was towering and muscular, lacking a face but featuring a single eerie eye that emitted a silver light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne just broke through to Class B, his soul of powers was 66 feet high, which was even larger than that of the average Class B+ metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was also one of the reasons why Osborne was able to kill a Class B+.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, after absorbing the unique energy of an entire blood diamond, Osborne's soul of powers had reached a towering height of 164 feet, appearing incredibly robust and exuding an immense sense of oppression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne felt that he still had not reached Class B+, and his soul of powers </span><span>still had potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perhaps, I need to absorb three blood diamonds so that my soul of powers can evolve and reach Class B+," Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he stared at the scattered fragments of the blood diamond, Osborne couldn't help but feel a sense of resignation. It was just as he had suspected before. When using the blood diamond to enhance physical capabilities, it would lose its blood-like color and transform into a flawless diamond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if it were used to increase the level of the soul of powers, the blood diamond would shatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A perfect diamond is worth at least two or three billion dollars!" Osborne murmured, feeling a pang in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he wasn't lacking in money, no one would willingly waste billions of dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still had twenty-seven blood diamonds. If they could be preserved, even if they were not so perfect, they would be worth at least tens of billions, which is more than all his assets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If all of them were shattered, he was afraid he would go crazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have to think of a way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What if I use the blood diamond to increase my soul of powers first, and after absorbing half of the energy, I'll use the remaining half to improve my physical fitness?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this way, maybe it won't shatter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this thought in mind, Osborne began to experiment and put it into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He locked himself in a room, continuing to observe Ryan's movements and also keeping an eye on other members of the Augustine family. While doing so, he absorbed the blood diamond to enhance his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the first day, he absorbed half of the energy from the blood diamond, and his soul of powers grew from 164 feet to 213 feet. Then, he fused all the unique energy of the blood diamond into every cell of his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, intense pain surged through his body once again. Despite his previous experience, Osborne still convulsed in agony. If it weren't for his strong willpower, he would have given up immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he still endured it, and it only took him half a day to absorb the other half of the energy in the blood diamond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, Osborne's body was drenched in sweat as if he had been pulled out of water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, all of his efforts were worthwhile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt that his physical capabilities had become even more formidable, heading in a direction that others couldn't comprehend, sprinting all the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What an incredible feeling!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt that with his current physical capabilities, even if Ryan's gravity force were five times stronger, it would not affect his movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Kaden transformed into a giant, he could easily swat his giant body away with a single palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I continue like this, my physical capabilities will probably reach the level of a </span><span>Class A master before my power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, once my physical capabilities reach Class A, I will definitely be much stronger than the average Class A martial master!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was extremely excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, as he had expected, the blood diamond did not shatter. Although there were many fine cracks on it, causing it to lose its perfection and greatly reducing its value, at least it was preserved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With its massive size, even in an imperfect state, it still held a value of over a billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alison were to design it, the value would be even higher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne decided he would continue to use blood diamonds in this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only could he preserve the invaluable diamond, but it also allowed his extra energy and physical capabilities to progress simultaneously, growing stronger with each advancement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This method of enhancing his power with the blood diamond felt almost like using cheat codes for ordinary metahuman or martial artists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rapid improvement was intoxicating for Osborne, and he wished to continue practicing in this way until both his extra energy and physical capabilities broke through to Class A.</span></p></div>
