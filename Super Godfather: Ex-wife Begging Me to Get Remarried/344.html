        <h1>Chapter 344 Illusion Projection</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staring at him, Osborne sneered, "A dead person doesn't need to know so much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leading metahuman suddenly became furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he remained composed. Despite the five of them besieging Osborne, they failed to gain any advantage. They believed they had trapped him, yet he managed to escape secretly, ultimately turning the tables by killing Eric.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the metahuman was alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given Osborne's numerous and unconventional tactics, he lacked all confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon realizing this, the metahuman swiftly pivoted around and fled, aiming to reunite with the other three. Only together did they stand a chance against Osborne in combat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to run away?" Osborne sneered again. Faced with too many adversaries, he harbored concerns about being unable to eliminate them all. Hence, he refrained from deploying many of his abilities, wary of exposing himself to the mastermind orchestrating events from the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he had only one opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as this guy was eliminated, he didn't have to fret about being exposed, regardless of how many abilities he used.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, come on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took action. His ocular energy swept across the body of the leading metahuman in black, ensnaring him as if in a quagmire. Instantly, his escape speed plummeted by 90% at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne caught up with him in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Weren't you quite arrogant just moments ago? Now, let's see if you can keep that attitude up!" Osborne snorted derisively, and a potent green Devil's Light coalesced in his palm and struck the metahuman violently. Although he still condensed a solid layer of ice in defense, it proved paper-thin before the onslaught of the green Devil's Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leading metahuman was flung out, blood spraying, crashing heavily into the sea's surface with a resounding splash and then rebounding like a stone skipping across water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a pale face, he looked extremely terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth, suddenly changed direction, and plunged into the sea, seeking refuge in the depths of the seabed, hoping Osborne wouldn't dare pursue him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, it was unrealistic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Into the water? That's great!" Osborne sneered, his gaze fixed on his escape route through Satan's Eye, swiftly harnessing the power of thunder and lightning. In an instant, a bolt of lightning crashed down upon the sea's surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The formidable lightning conducted exceptionally well through the water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leading metahuman, struggling desperately to flee, instantly felt his body paralyzed and rigid. Despite his screams, he inadvertently swallowed several mouthfuls of seawater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the power of thunder and lightning!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What prompted it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How many powers did Osborne have?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, overwhelmed with intense fear and shock, he endured the piercing pain and numbness and swam quickly to a greater depth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered and waved his hand gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, the sea surface parted. He manipulated the surrounding seawater to clear a path, swiftly closing in on the metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The metahuman sensed something amiss, glanced back, and was so frightened that his very soul almost leaped from his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Control the seawater?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is a water elemental power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is impossible!" The metahuman roared madly. Osborne's ability to control the seawater completely shattered his idea of escaping by diving into the seabed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only rush out of the sea and glared at Osborne with a dark face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who on earth are you? How could you possess so many powers?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "I mentioned that a dead person doesn't need to know so much! I won't waste time with you. Now, you can go to hell with peace of mind!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he was about to take action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But suddenly, an idea came into his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Satan's Eye had ascended to level five, unveiling a fresh power, Illusion Projection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until now, he had not yet tried it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just use it on him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne made up his mind. While Illusion Projection was typically the power of psychics, he could replicate the effect with Satan's Eye at level five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, it would be stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mental energy was surprisingly robust. Thanks to alterations in his body, it had surged to the peak of Class B+, rivaling that of a Class A- psychic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without delay, his Satan's Eye emitted a silent wave that pierced into the metahuman's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes widened in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He trembled violently, as if disconnected from the outside world, trapped in a nightmare from which he couldn't break free no matter how hard he struggled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Was it successful?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was still somewhat uncertain. After all, it was his first time using Illusion Projection. He contemplated conjuring eerie, ghostly illusions to intimidate the metahuman, and Satan's Eye helped him accomplish it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&#8203;He had no idea what the effect would be.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The metahuman appeared ensnared in vivid illusions, encountering numerous terrifying apparitions, unable to awaken from the ordeal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since he's not moving, can I kill him now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this in mind, Osborne promptly approached the metahuman, who remained unresponsive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he appeared in front of the metahuman and punched his head hard without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The metahuman abruptly seemed to sense danger to his life and finally broke free from the illusions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was still in a panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as he witnessed Osborne's powerful fist rapidly enlarging before his eyes, fear instantly gave way to despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a shrill scream, and then his head exploded like a watermelon with a bang.</span></p></div>
