        <h1>Chapter 95 Turning the Situation Around</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The fierce battle had officially begun.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With Osborne&rsquo;s reminder, the men of Bodyguard Unit Three and Bodyguard Unit Four reacted most quickly. They got out of their cars at the first opportunity and tackled the driver of the blocking truck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, they sought cover and began to fight back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The gunfire sounded instantly and continuously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa&rsquo;s four Bodyguard Units, plus her personal guards, totaled fifty men. But there were more enemies. They rose from the bushes to shoot, at least hundreds of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Equally well-equipped and armed, they instantly overwhelmed Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguards, leaving them to hide behind cover.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">From time to time, bodyguards who were too late to dodge were hit by bullets and fell to the ground with injuries.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was also hiding behind the cover. He didn&rsquo;t rush to counterattack but only raised his gun to fire and burst the rockets when they came.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He quickly looked around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul had run off somewhere. He was no longer visible on the battlefield, and several of the personal guards were missing at the same time. The others were fighting back as hard as they could.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;It seems there are only a handful of people who follow Paul in betraying the Radcliffe family.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After the thought, Osborne began to fight back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Draco Model H handgun in his hands fired extremely fast. With accurate marksmanship, Osborne took down the enemies hiding in the bushes one by one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguards were good shots, and some of them were even as good as Osborne. But they didn&rsquo;t have Satan&rsquo;s Eye, and it was hard for them to find their enemies through the cover. They couldn&rsquo;t kill the enemy as efficiently as Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Immediately, there was much less enemy gunfire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that moment, the five people from Bodyguard Unit Four had quietly gotten to the enemy&rsquo;s rear. They didn&rsquo;t hesitate to blast at the enemy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Boom!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Instantly, violent explosions occurred at the enemy&rsquo;s position. Countless enemies were blown to pieces and let out mournful screams. Their formation was instantly disorganized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Violet was overjoyed to see this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;All hands on deck, counterattack.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguards naturally wouldn&rsquo;t let go of such an opportunity. They quickly came out from behind their cover and began to counter-pressurize the enemy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">One by one, the enemy fell, and the situation began to turn around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Osborne didn&rsquo;t relax.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He knew that these black-clad gunmen were only minor players and that the real enemy had yet not to appear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Hmph!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As expected, a cold snort filled with murderous intent suddenly resounded from the fierce battlefield.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was like muffled thunder, even overpowering the fierce gunfire, making everyone feel their eardrums ache and their heads spin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the next second, a thick dark cloud suddenly appeared over everyone, obscuring the sky and the sun, making the surroundings seem to turn into night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Everyone was feeling nervous at this point.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Finally,&rdquo; Osborne murmured, his expression incredibly grave. He knew it was Raymond from Class C+metahumen of the Aberrants, who could control thunderbolts, who had arrived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Everybody get in the car! Evade the thunderbolt!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne yelled, pulling open Clarissa&rsquo;s door and quickly getting in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Everyone from Bodyguard Unit Three and Bodyguard Unit Four also got in the car immediately on Sharon and Violet&rsquo;s orders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, the people in Bodyguard Unit One, Bodyguard Unit Two, and the Personal Guards were much slower to respond.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The next second, terrifying thunderbolts tore through the sky. The twisting thunderbolts struck every exposed person and metal car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Instantly, twenty or so people from Bodyguard Unit One, Bodyguard Unit Two, and the Personal Guards collapsed with screams.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They had been hit hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The men of Bodyguard Unit Three and Bodyguard Unit Four, who were hiding in the car, were unharmed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Because the car shell was a complete Faraday cage, thunderbolts striking the car did not cause harm to anyone who was inside the Faraday cage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Damn. Raymond again.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna became angry when she saw this and immediately wanted to get out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Let me out. Only I can hold him off.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne hurriedly stopped her and said gently, &ldquo;Ms. Donna, don&rsquo;t rush. It&rsquo;s not time for you to come out yet.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna frowned, staring intently at Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Osborne, do you know something? You don&rsquo;t seem to be panicking at all. Why did you call Paul a spy? Why did you know there would be an attack?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Donna finished, Clarissa looked at Osborne curiously as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne smiled, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be in a hurry. I will tell you everything you want to know when it&rsquo;s over. For now, let&rsquo;s repel the enemy.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, Osborne pushed open the car door and stepped out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Are you courting death? You can&rsquo;t block Raymond&rsquo;s thunderbolts. You&rsquo;ll die if you get off.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne turned his head and said calmly, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my duty to protect Ms. Radcliffe.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After that, he slammed the car door shut and looked into the distant sky.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A dark shadow stood in the air there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was like a god, surrounded by terrifying thunderbolts that crackled and snapped, condescendingly looking at Osborne as if he were looking at a dead man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Are you trying to thwart me again?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Since you dare to come out, I&rsquo;ll kill you first and let you turn into ashes.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, Raymond pointed to Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In an instant, a terrifying thunderbolt tore through the sky to strike down madly towards Osborne.</p></div>
