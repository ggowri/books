        <h1>Chapter 1300 The Use of the Sanctuary Gems</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Osborne's movements, Divine Shadow rushed forward, raising her voice. "Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what are you doing? You can't just take that! That's part of the Sanctuary Necklace, a treasured item of the Sublime Saintess! The Sanctuary Necklace is a gift from our master to the Sublime Saintess, composed of a hundred Sanctuary Gems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Deschanel Clan have been utterly wasteful, using it as a 'coffin' to escape disaster!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, now that the Deschanel Clan is finished, those Sanctuary Gems rightfully belong to her! I'm taking them back to the Sublime Saintess, so hand them over&mdash;now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow shot a fierce glare at Osborne, her frustration palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a twinge of embarrassment. He had temporarily forgotten the connection between Divine Shadow and Mila. Mila had informed him before that these so-called "Sanctuary Caskets" were indeed fragments of her Sanctuary Necklace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, yes, these gems should rightly belong to Mila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne offered a casual smile, deflecting the tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, Grandma Divine Shadow, I do know these Sanctuary Gems used to belong to Mila! But... she actually gave them to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mila gave them to you?" Divine Shadow blinked in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded confidently. "Absolutely! After I rescued Mila, she expressed her gratitude by bestowing upon me the most precious 'Sanctuary Gem'. The rest? Just leftovers, really.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't think Mila would want those 'leftovers' back, would she?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his bright smile intact, he watched Divine Shadow closely for her reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leftovers?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow struggled to find a retort. True, Mila had indeed been rescued by Osborne. If it weren't for him, they wouldn't have been able to eliminate the Deschanel Clan and obtain those Sanctuary Gems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Demanding the gems back wouldn't hold much weight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sighing, she finally relented. "Fine! I'll ask Mila about it. If she really gifted them to you, then... I won't push it. But you need to take good care of them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne asked, "Grandma Divine Shadow, do you know exactly what these Sanctuary Gems are capable of? Mila mentioned she'd forgotten..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, Divine Shadow felt her patience wearing thin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So let me get this straight. Mila gave you the Sanctuary Gems because she forgot how valuable they are?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was momentarily taken aback, speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow waved a hand dismissively. "Forget it! Those gems originally belonged to Mila, and if she wants to give them to you, that's her business! Besides, they don't have much utility in her hands, but in yours, they could be incredibly powerful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up, realization dawning on him. "Grandma Divine Shadow, please enlighten me! I still don't know what exactly these Sanctuary Gems can do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow explained calmly, "These Sanctuary Gems can be used to create a stable Dimensional Microcosm. As a spatial metahuman, you should know that using spatial energy allows you to create a Dimensional Space, but such a space is unstable and requires constant energy input.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If anything happens to you, the space collapses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Moreover, this type of space can only store inanimate objects; living beings can't survive within it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, if you integrate a Sanctuary Gem into the Dimensional Space, it becomes completely stable, transforming into a Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This microcosm can mimic the real world with all its features&mdash;mountains, rivers, lakes, and seas. It's like a paradise where even living beings can reside and train. A standard Sanctuary Gem can construct a microcosm spanning about 6 miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back in the Age of Gods, these gems were incredibly rare and valuable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The one particularly unique Sanctuary Gem could create a stable Dimensional Microcosm covering 3000 miles&mdash;a true treasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Many Deity Kings wanted to buy that gem, but the master refused every offer and eventually strung it together with ninety-nine ordinary Sanctuary Gems into a necklace, gifting it to Mila."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow cast a slightly resentful glance at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such priceless treasures were now in Osborne's possession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood there, awestruck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, with a Sanctuary Gem and my spatial power, I could create a stable Dimensional Microcosm and move the Augustine family into it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow responded calmly, "Have you reached Level Six with your space elemental essence? If you have, then yes, you can."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's excitement deflated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His space elemental essence was still at the peak of Level Five. However, he had already set the second core energy of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to be absorbed by his space elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was confident that soon, his space elemental essence would break through to Level Six.</span></p></div>
