        <h1>Chapter 544 Lucky Guy?</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, it is the Heir's Emblem. Wearing it, you will be the future heir recognized by the main bloodline and the nine branch bloodlines of the Augustine family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you want it?" Caleb looked at everyone's fiery gazes and said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone swallowed and said nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, they wanted it, but they knew that Caleb would never give them the Heir's Emblem.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If they wanted to get it, they must defeat all the competitors of the branch bloodlines.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only the strongest person could become the heir.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Elder Caleb, please tell us the rules of the competition," Lance said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb smiled. "Okay, if you want to become the heir of the Augustine family and have the opportunity to become the head of the family in the future, you must show your strength, courage, and wisdom, and become the two strongest among the branch bloodlines.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now, let me tell you the rules of the competition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The rules are very simple. You need to compete for the emblems.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Later, I will pick two lucky guys to take these two emblems and leave first. After ten minutes, the rest of you can go after them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The two emblems will automatically send out a signal every fifteen minutes, so you can roughly locate them. You can use any means to catch up with them and snatch the emblems. As long as you don't kill people, you can use any means.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's six o'clock in the afternoon now. At twelve o'clock in the evening, I will be waiting for you at Lostridge Peak, the highest peak of the Lostridge Mountains. At that time, whoever can hand over the Heir's Emblem to me will be the fifth and sixth heir to the family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you understand?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Caleb finished speaking, everyone nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The rules were simple. After six hours, whoever brought the emblem to Lostridge Peak and handed it over to Caleb would be the heir.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The rules were simple, but the process would be difficult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A total of 123 people from nine branch bloodlines would fight for the two emblems like crazy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne thought, "If one doesn't have enough strength, he won't be able to keep the emblem even if he gets it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The emblem will transmit a signal every fifteen minutes, and everyone can locate it. In other words, even if one wants to hide somewhere with the emblem, he will be found quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So the person who gets the emblem first has no advantage, but may be besieged."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne shrank back into the corner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had a plan in mind. He would let the others fight first and consume their strength. When the time was almost up, he would suddenly make a move, snatch an emblem, and use his spatial power to rush to Lostridge Peak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By then, he would become the heir.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, now I'm going to pick two lucky guys. These two people will get the emblems first, but they will also be subject to a special rule."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying that, Caleb looked at everyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Elder Caleb, what is the special rule?" Lance asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb smiled. "This special rule is that the two people who get the emblem first will be eliminated immediately if their emblem is snatched away."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing these words, everyone was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, who wants to be one of the two lucky guys and get the emblem first?" Caleb asked with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone was silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They were not fools. If there was no special rule, they wouldn't mind getting the emblem first. At worst, when they couldn't keep it, they could just give it to others and look for another opportunity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But because of the special rule, the person who got the emblem first would be eliminated immediately if he lost the emblem.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Therefore, no one would be willing to be the first to get the emblem.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is there no one willing to be one of the two lucky guys?" Caleb asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm willing!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lance said calmly, "I don't mind getting the emblem first. If anyone among you wants to snatch my emblem, just come. If you can snatch it away, you are capable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But if you can't and get beaten to death by me accidentally, don't blame me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After he finished speaking, he took an emblem from Caleb's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He casually hung the emblem on his chest and glanced at everyone unscrupulously with threats on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone's faces looked ugly at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were only two emblems, one of which had been obtained by Lance. It was difficult for them to snatch the emblem from Lance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, there was another one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There is still one emblem left. Is there anyone who wants to get the emblem in advance?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No one spoke, not even Sam and David.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They knew that the competition for this emblem would be the most intense, and whoever got it first would face siege from almost everyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Sam and David were not sure they could keep it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once they lost it, they would be eliminated, which was something they couldn't accept.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This person was not lucky at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, after everyone figured out the key, no one spoke again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb sighed, "It seems that no one is willing to be the lucky guy. In this case, I will pick one."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He began to scan the people present.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone who made eye contact with him quickly looked away, fearing that they would be chosen by him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, Caleb's gaze stopped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He casually threw the emblem in his hand and said, "Osborne, you are the lucky guy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll give the emblem to you."</p></div>
