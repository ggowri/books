        <h1>Chapter 1422 Mining Area</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm still too low on the totem pole to even know where the Artisan Institute is located. Once I climb a bit higher, I'll definitely pay them a visit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the opportunity arises, I'll make it my mission to take the whole place down, converting all their researchers into Blood Clan members to serve me," Osborne thought as he returned to his stone chamber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he stepped inside, Harry and Amelia visibly relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's return meant his disguise had held up, and for the moment, they were safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said with his tone serious, "Listen up. I have a mission tomorrow and will be away for a while. I need to head to the No. 9 mining area to deal with some Deathborns. If all goes well, I'll be back before you know it. You two stay put in my stone chamber and focus on your training. Don't venture out; the hostility towards the Human Community here runs deep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're still too weak and need to level up fast."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia nodded in agreement. "Don't worry, we won't leave. We won't cause you any trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, Harry murmured, "The No. 9 mining area is way bigger than our No. 3 mining area. We're lucky to be close to Wild Flame City, only a few thousand miles away. Most of the high-level Deathborns have already been cleared out, so we rarely encounter them while mining.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I've heard that miners in the No. 9 area face Deathborn attacks all the time! The average work tenure for Human Community miners there is less than two years!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Most don't survive that long; they end up dead from Deathborn assaults. The miners at No. 9 have it way worse than us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned at this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An average work tenure of only two years? That's unacceptable! I'll find a way to change that in the future. But for now, I don't have the power to do anything about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So go train. The stronger you are, the more you can change things. Without strength, no amount of good intentions or sympathy will make a difference."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne retreated to his room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, he found a terminal computer that required Lachlan's divine power to access.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a bit of tinkering, he successfully booted it up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne began searching for information on the No. 9 mining area, determined to gather as much intel as possible before his mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The No. 9 mining area was located northwest of Wild Flame City, about 220 thousand miles away, covering an area of 110 thousand square feet. It was a treasure trove, the only mining area within the Wild Flame City jurisdiction that produced top-grade Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Currently, there were about a million Human Community miners working in No. 9, most of them at Junior Deity level, with a few at Intermediate Deity level and around three hundred overseers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This area could produce over 200 million low-grade Essence Crystals each month, nearly covering 30% of the Wild Flame Army's expenses, making it crucial for the army's operations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Additionally, it produced about 100 thousand mid-grade Essence Crystals monthly and occasionally yielded top-grade ones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly absorbed the information about the No. 9 mining area, committing every detail to memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The previous Lachlan had poured all his energy into exploiting the Human Community miners, focusing on flattery and bribery for his superiors, leaving him with little knowledge of these fundamental aspects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne was a man with grand ambitions, and he knew that the more he understood, the better prepared he would be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne muttered to himself, "So it turns out that out of the twelve mining areas near Wild Flame City, only the No. 9 yields top-grade Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder I couldn't find any in the No. 3 mining area despite searching for so long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A single top-grade Essence Crystal is worth 10 thousand low-grade ones! And using top-grade Crystals for training speeds up the process significantly. If I get a chance, I need to sneak into the depths of the No. 9 mining area and see if I can find some.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though I can't use them now, they'll be perfect for Grandpa and Anastasia in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne continued his research.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A lingering question gnawed at him. Why hadn't any of the miners in these zones displayed earth elemental power like his? Earth elemental power wasn't exactly rare; there should be a few carriers around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone with such power would be a hundred times more efficient at mining Essence Crystals than ordinary miners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he hadn't encountered a single individual with earth elemental power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that people in Celestara can't activate earth elemental power?" Osborne pondered, diving into his terminal to search for answers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, he found nothing concrete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew people in Celestara could indeed activate the power, but anyone who did seemed to vanish from a young age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regardless of their origin, those who unlocked earth elemental power were whisked away in secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't determine who was behind this, but piecing together various clues pointed towards a single location: Divine Peak Nine.</span></p></div>
