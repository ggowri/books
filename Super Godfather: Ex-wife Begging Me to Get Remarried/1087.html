        <h1>Chapter 1086 Dense Blood Energy</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... how dare you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armstrong struggled to speak, his voice trembling as he looked down in disbelief at the massive hole in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike Gerardo, he didn't possess such formidable regenerative abilities; Osborne's punch had obliterated his heart and shattered his insides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kind of injury was more than enough to be fatal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood began to seep from the corners of Armstrong's mouth, a steady stream he couldn't seem to stop. Regret and hatred twisted his features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted, "My father won't let this slide!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Thornberry family won't forget this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The League of Divine Descent will come for you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be waiting for you in hell! And Gerardo, you dared to betray me, I swear..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armstrong's voice broke as he coughed up a mouthful of blood, his body collapsing to the ground with a heavy thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's cold gaze lingered on the lifeless body of the top-tier Class S warrior. He didn't take Armstrong's threats seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "The Thornberry family won't let this go?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The League of Divine Descent won't forget me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fine by me! I wasn't planning on letting them off the hook anyway. Helios? The so-called strongest on Blue Planet?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all deserve to die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone involved in the siege against the Augustine family will pay the price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And as for Gerardo, he will die in the most painful way possible. No one will save him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne hadn't chased Gerardo just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First, he knew he couldn't catch Gerardo. Gerardo's mastery of spatial power was still superior; with every interdimensional travel, he could cover at least 500 miles. By now, Gerardo was probably back in his stronghold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And within that stronghold lay a multitude of powerful warriors. Even if Osborne managed to catch up, he might not be able to take Gerardo down alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Secondly, there were more pressing matters at hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Augustine family were still under siege!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Aberrants had over three hundred Class S clones and thousands of ordinary clones relentlessly hunting down the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simultaneously, Class S warriors from the League of Divine Descent and the Eityreia Organization were on a mad killing spree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had to act fast to save them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could always deal with Gerardo later; the members of the Augustine family, if killed, wouldn't get a second chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a frosty expression, Osborne muttered, "Gerardo, consider yourself lucky. I'll let you live a little longer. Once I sort this out, I'll pay you a visit and send you straight to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he had a moment to send a message to Wesson. While waiting for a response, he quickly absorbed the residual blood energy in the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blood energy was astonishingly dense!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It surpassed anything Osborne had ever encountered before. Not long ago, this very spot had been a battlefield for nearly 100 thousand Class A and above warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, fewer than 50 thousand survived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least six hundred Class S warriors had perished, most of them Aberrants' clones, but several normal Class S warriors had also fallen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, with Armstrong&mdash;a top-tier Class S&mdash;dead at his hands, the blood energy here was overwhelming!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, after breaking through to Class S, the Blood Cross' capacity to absorb blood energy had increased significantly. In the past, Osborne would have struggled to absorb even a fraction of this energy; most would have gone to waste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he could easily take it all in!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his Class S status, the barriers that had once held back the Blood Demon members from reaching this level had finally shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "With enough blood energy, they can all ascend! With this much blood energy concentrated here, it's enough for at least a hundred members of the Blood Demon Vanguard to make the leap to Class S!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And there's even some leftovers!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We could potentially elevate two hundred Blood Demon members to Class S!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as Osborne glanced at his Draco Star Wristlet, his heart sank. Wesson still hadn't replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope nothing's gone wrong..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne speculated that Wesson was likely engaged in a fight, which was why he hadn't responded. Without wasting another moment, he began sending messages to everyone he knew, checking in on their locations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't afford to wait around; Osborne had to follow the trail of the fleeing Augustine family. Activating Satan's Eye, he set off in pursuit, scanning for any signs of their passage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Minutes ticked by, and despite his efforts, he hadn't found any trace of the Augustine family. Just as frustration began to creep in, his Draco Star Wristlet vibrated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced down, and his face paled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn the Eityreia Organization! You're all going to pay for this! Not a single one of you will leave here alive today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a chilling resolve, he ripped open a dimensional rift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa had provided him with a coordinate just 60 miles away. In a heartbeat, he executed his interdimensional travel, arriving almost instantaneously at the new location.</span></p></div>
