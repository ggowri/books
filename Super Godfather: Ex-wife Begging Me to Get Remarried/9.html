        <h1>Chapter 9 Fake Explosives</h1>
        <div><p>As the woman finished shouting, an uproar ensued.</p><p>Osborne&#x27;s face paled suddenly, and he turned to look at the woman who&#x27;d spoken.</p><p>He recognized her. She was Ophelia&#x27;s cousin, Penelope Caldwell. In her early twenties, she was a real knockout, with delicate features, a curvy bust, and a perky behind.</p><p>Ophelia stared at Penelope and raised her voice. &quot;Penelope, what did you say?&quot;</p><p>Penelope blurted out, &quot;Ophelia, Justin just messaged me. The explosives on Osborne are all fake! Justin saw this good-for-nothing sneaking into a general store before coming here.</p><p>&quot;Out of curiosity, Justin went into the store with his men and got the store owner to talk. It turns out Osborne made these fake explosives with some discarded materials in that grocery store.</p><p>&quot;They look real on the outside, but inside it&#x27;s just sand!</p><p>&quot;This bastard used fake explosives to scare us! He&#x27;d do anything for money!</p><p>&quot;Thank goodness Justin found out!</p><p>&quot;Ophelia, get your men to grab this waste right away. Don&#x27;t let him run off with the money!&quot;</p><p>After Penelope finished, shock and anger flashed across Ophelia&#x27;s face.</p><p>She glared at Osborne and gritted her teeth. &quot;Osborne, you&#x27;re asking for trouble! You used fake explosives to scare me for money? You almost got away with it!&quot;</p><p>With that, Ophelia was about to order her bodyguards to move in.</p><p>Everyone in the Caldwell family was furious. They stared at Osborne as if they could devour him.</p><p>&quot;This damned bastard almost swindled the Caldwell family out of twenty million dollars!&quot;</p><p>&quot;This good-for-nothing deserves to die!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Just make him disappear for good!&quot;</p><p>The more terrified they&#x27;d been of the explosives earlier, the more arrogant they were now. They all threatened to make Osborne vanish forever.</p><p>Suddenly, Osborne burst into laughter, full of mockery and disdain.</p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded and stared at him blankly.</p><p>&quot;What&#x27;s this waste laughing about? His secret&#x27;s been exposed by Justin. How can he still laugh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Is he not afraid of death?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Without the threat of the bombs, he won&#x27;t leave the Caldwell family alive today!&quot;</p><p>&quot;He&#x27;s just putting on a brave face!&quot;</p><p>Ophelia also gave Osborne a cold look. &quot;What are you laughing at, you loser?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m laughing at how stupid you are,&quot; Osborne said calmly.</p><p>Ophelia fumed. &quot;What did you say? Osborne, you&#x27;re asking for it! Even though we were once married, don&#x27;t blame me for making you disappear forever after what you&#x27;ve done!&quot;</p><p>Osborne scoffed and continued, &quot;Ophelia, I never thought you could be this stupid! Have you forgotten that Justin is your biggest rival in the race for the family heir?</p><p>&quot;Sure, you&#x27;ve won. But use your head. What if you die? Who stands to gain the most?</p><p>&quot;If you&#x27;re gone, Justin is the one who&#x27;ll benefit the most. He&#x27;ll step into your shoes right away, become the new heir of the Caldwell family, and take control of the family&#x27;s billion-dollar fortune.</p><p>&quot;So, do you still think the explosives on me are fake?</p><p>&quot;Don&#x27;t you wonder if Justin is just trying to use me to blow you up?&quot;</p><p>After Osborne had his say, Ophelia&#x27;s face turned deathly pale, and her back was soaked with sweat.</p><p>Osborne&#x27;s words made sense. If she died, Justin would definitely be the biggest winner.</p><p>Was Justin trying to kill her?!</p><p>Everyone in the Caldwell family stood there, stunned and looking terrified.</p><p>Only Penelope spoke up in a hurry, &quot;Osborne, you loser, stop trying to deceive us! My brother isn&#x27;t like that. The explosives on you are definitely fake. Otherwise, would my brother want to kill me, his own sister?&quot;</p><p>Hearing this, Osborne sneered in contempt, &quot;So what? Compared to the Caldwell family&#x27;s billion-dollar fortune and power, what are you?</p><p>&quot;And if your brother is so sure the explosives on me are fake, why doesn&#x27;t he come here and expose me himself? Why does he have to use you to do it?</p><p>&quot;Because he&#x27;s a coward. He&#x27;s afraid I&#x27;ll blow him up too.&quot;</p><p>After Osborne finished, everyone fell silent.</p><p>They all lowered their heads, thinking about what he&#x27;d said. The more they thought, the more they realized he had a point.</p><p>Once doubt was planted, trust crumbled.</p><p>They began to doubt Justin.</p><p>Penelope was so angry that her pretty face turned red. She took out her phone. &quot;Justin would never want to kill me! I&#x27;m calling him on video right now. You&#x27;d better have the guts to confront him!</p><p>&quot;Osborne, you bastard, just wait to be exposed!&quot;</p></div>
