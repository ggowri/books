        <h1>Chapter 771 Rising to the Global Godson Rankings</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew's face was dark with anger. His eyes filled with rage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He now realized that although his&nbsp;Water Realm&nbsp;was stronger than Osborne's&nbsp;Spatial Domain, space manipulation abilities were naturally superior to water-based ones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the same level, a space-wielding metahuman could easily overpower a water-based one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This made Andrew furious and unwilling to accept the reality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet he still didn't fully grasp his situation. He believed that, since Osborne was only Class AA, their power difference was too great, and no matter how troublesome the&nbsp;Spatial Domain&nbsp;was, he wouldn't lose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmph!" Andrew scoffed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew sneered. "Kid, show me what you've got! You're just Class AA. Even with your&nbsp;Domain, don't think you can beat me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, really?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smirked. "Then let's see you try!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne reached toward Andrew.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Spatial Collapse!!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rumble!!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The space around Andrew began to violently collapse, and the terrifying force made his hair stand on end. His reflexes were quick, allowing him to dodge the core of the collapse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even at the edges, the power was overwhelming. Andrew quickly summoned his&nbsp;Water Realm&nbsp;to shield himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Crack!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A large section of space collapsed and vanished, the devastating force slamming into Andrew. Even with his&nbsp;Water Realm protecting him, his face turned pale, and blood trickled from the corner of his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He stared at Osborne in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Spatial Collapse? What terrifying power!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne chuckled. "Nice reflexes! But next time, you might not be so lucky."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Osborne reached out again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Spatial Prison!!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Spatial Collapse!!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rumble!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, the space around Andrew shifted again, forming a prison that trapped him. Then, the collapsing force surged forth, attempting to collapse both the prison and Andrew into a singularity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Andrew felt the threat of death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He channeled his&nbsp;Water Realm, frantically attacking the&nbsp;Spatial Prison. After barely breaking free, the collapse had already begun.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The terrifying force started collapsing his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn it! Break out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew unleashed all his power, desperately trying to escape the core of the collapse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But in that instant, Osborne acted again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Spatial Stretching!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as Andrew was less than a mile away from escaping the core, that mile stretched into dozens of miles, turning the gap into an insurmountable chasm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despair flooded Andrew's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rumble!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The fearsome collapsing force erupted, shattering Andrew's defenses in an instant. His body followed, bursting into a torrent of blood before collapsing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bam!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew's body was about to disappear entirely within the collapse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne waved his hand, dispersing the collapsing force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even so, Andrew had been severely wounded. His body, like a ragdoll, was tossed onto the arena, too weak to stand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked at Osborne in terror, blood gushing from his mouth as he coughed uncontrollably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's figure flashed, appearing in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne sneered. "Andrew! Did you ever think, while humiliating others, that one day you'd be humiliated, too? Now, I'm giving you back what you did to Rhett!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Osborne stepped on Andrew's head, grinding his face into the ground. Blood flowed out instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew's eyes were filled with anger and humiliation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thud!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He spat out a mouthful of blood, his head slumped to the side, and he passed out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne snorted and stopped the humiliation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He took a deep breath and waved his hand, withdrawing his&nbsp;Spatial Domain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, countless spectators below the arena were staring at him, mouths agape in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart and Vivian were also looking at him in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Rhett, who had just regained consciousness, stared at him with a complicated expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne had defeated Andrew!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew was ranked 465th on the Global Godson Rankings, having successfully made the list five years ago and becoming a Godson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, he had been beaten by Osborne, who was only Class AA!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's&nbsp;Spatial Domain&nbsp;left everyone who witnessed the battle in shock, even the Godsons had serious expressions on their faces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their previous arrogance and disdain had completely vanished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Gasp!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, someone gasped in shock, exclaiming, "He actually did it! He's only Class AA and he defeated Andrew!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"According to the rules, doesn't this mean he will replace Andrew and become a new Godson, ranked 465th on the Global Godson Rankings?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wow! His&nbsp;Spatial Domain&nbsp;is terrifying!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd erupted into intense discussions, many gazing at Osborne with both admiration and envy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne raised his eyebrows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did I just make it onto the Global Godson Rankings?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Am I now a Godson?!"</p></div>
