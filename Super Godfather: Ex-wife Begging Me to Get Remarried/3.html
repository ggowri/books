        <h1>Chapter 3: The First Test</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mind buzzed and his heart thundered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Him, the Godfather's heir?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There had to be a catch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather's empire was vast and colossal, spanning and dominating every major industry in Rosmandi. He commanded thousands. His connections were intricate. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne doubted he could handle it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he took over now, it might all fall apart. Surely the Godfather knew that. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think I can do it?" he asked, frowning. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather smiled. "Kid, I admire your composure. Yes, I think you can do it. But you</span><span>'</span><span>re not ready. To be my heir, you</span><span>'</span><span>ll need to pass a series of tests. You</span><span>'</span><span>ll need to show me you possess the necessary courage, wisdom, cunning, and charm."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sighed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>How many tests will I have to pass?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ten in total,</span><span>"</span><span> the Godfather continued. </span><span>"</span><span>For each test you pass, you</span><span>'</span><span>ll gain a portion of my wealth and power. Pass them all, and you'll be the new Godfather&mdash;only better. You</span><span>'</span><span>ll become the Super Godfather."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Super Godfather?</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But, a word of caution,</span><span>"</span><span> the Godfather sternly warned. </span><span>"</span><span>The tests are dangerous. Once you start, there's no going back. Fail, and you won't just lose the opportunity&mdash;you may perish."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne swallowed hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, if you don't want to risk it, I can give you one billion dollars in cash and send you somewhere safe. You could live rich, kid. It</span><span>'</span><span>s the least I could do for my only grandson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One billion in cash?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was shocked. The Godfather offered the money so casually, as if the sum was pocket change. Even the Caldwells could only dream of such immense wealth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne considered his options. On one hand, a billion dollars in cash and a safe place to live was a tempting offer. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other, a billion was a mere fraction of the Godfather</span><span>'</span><span>s fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why settle when he could inherit it all? Not just the money, but the power and respect that came with such a formidable title. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was risky, but it was also the best way to make his now-ex-wife Ophelia regret how she treated him.  </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was also the only way he could confront the Godfather and ask why he was abandoned. He didn</span><span>'</span><span>t think he could go on not knowing the answer to a question that had haunted him his entire life. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to be your heir!" Osborne declared, his eyes burning with determination. "No matter the danger, no matter the cost, I will pass your tests."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather gently smiled, as if relieved. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're greedier than I thought," he said, chuckling. "So be it. No special favors. You will earn what you seek&mdash;the power, the money, the influence, the women. They</span><span>'</span><span>re all part of the trials that await you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath, trying to steady his pulse. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will say this one last time,</span><span>"</span><span> the Godfather said. </span><span>"</span><span>To be clear, you understand that should anything go wrong during the course of these trials, I won't intervene. This is your last chance to rethink your decision. As the saying goes, greed leads to the abyss."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need,</span><span>"</span><span> he replied. </span><span>"</span><span>I've decided. This is about more than greed. It</span><span>'</span><span>s about a new world filled with opportunity and prosperity. Let</span><span>'</span><span>s get to it. What's the first trial?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather's eyes lit up. "Good! Then it</span><span>'</span><span>s settled. Your first trial is simple: go to the Caldwell family and demand a million dollars in cash for your divorce."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A million-dollar divorce?" Osborne asked. </span><span>"</span><span>That</span><span>'</span><span>s simple?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather grew stern. "I watched you become nothing more than the Caldwells</span><span>'</span><span> lowly son-in-law. As an Augustine, you are so much more than that. No one should leave you with nothing. It</span><span>'</span><span>s an insult for which no Augustine should settle. So go on. Claim your settlement from the Caldwells."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt his pulse quicken. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>And remember. If you fail, I won</span><span>'</span><span>t recognize you as my grandson. You won</span><span>'</span><span>t inherit a thing from me.</span><span>"</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather's harsh reminder made Osborne</span><span>'</span><span>s blood run cold. Demanding a million dollars from the Caldwells could easily end in disaster.  </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madness flickered in Osborne</span><span>'</span><span>s eyes. He had countless questions, but there was no point in delaying his reply any longer. With a sigh, he nodded. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll do it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather smiled. "Go, then. Show your courage and cunning. Prove you're worthy to be my heir. Remember, an Augustine can be killed&mdash;but </span><span style="font-style: italic;">never</span><span> humiliated. You have one day to secure your settlement."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded as the screen went black, then stepped out of the car without a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Securing a million-dollar divorce settlement from the Caldwells in one day? Even for a wealthy family like them, a million dollars is a huge ask. They</span><span style="font-style: italic;">'</span><span style="font-style: italic;">d likely rather kill me than pay up.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he walked down the street, he considered his options. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How should I go about this?</span><span> he wondered. To them, he was nothing more than an undeserving peasant. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t imagine this would end well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne continued down the street, his mind raced, searching for an answer, a tactic, a path&mdash;anything that could help him figure out how to complete his first trial. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spotted a general store and got a crazy, but perhaps brilliant, idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Maybe, just maybe, this could work&hellip; </span></p></div>
