        <h1>Chapter 498 He Is My Man</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Isa did not know why Osborne was uninjured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly analyzed in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After suffering Chris's mental attack, Osborne should have been injured but quickly recovered. The restorative power came from his Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An ordinary Satan's Eye certainly wouldn't have such an effect. This must be a unique ability of Osborne's mutated Satan's Eye. Or perhaps it is the ability acquired after his body merged with the soul of powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That guy was starting to become somewhat excessively powerful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa watched Osborne from a distance, smiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His body is strong and possesses remarkable recovery abilities. Even if he suffered heavy injuries, he could recover swiftly. Now, even his soul and spirit can recover quickly. Or, at the very least, he has become quite resilient."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Isa glanced at Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clenched her fists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I suddenly don't feel like kissing him. Instead, I want to beat him up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa fixed her gaze on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne had already severely injured Bruce with the Death Sickle and was about to kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lady Witch, it seems Osborne has won. We can leave now," Bryce said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa replied, "Not so fast. You have to make others believe that you killed Chris and Bruce."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce was momentarily stunned by her words, then nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lady Witch, do you want to conceal Osborne's strength? You don't want others to know that Osborne can already kill Chris and Bruce, so he won't be targeted?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa shot him a glance, saying, "Are you saying this to make yourself seem clever?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce's expression stiffened, and he fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hesitating for a moment, he could not help but ask, "Lady Witch, why didn't you kill George? Why did you let him go? If George dies, the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> will lose an important ally and might not return to </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> to start a war."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why would I have to kill him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa said, "The wheel of fate has begun to turn. This war in </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> is unavoidable. George should not die at my hands. His fate is to become a stepping stone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A stepping stone for whom? Is it me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce became somewhat agitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lady Witch, does my opportunity to break through to Class S lie with George? If I can kill George, can I advance to Class S?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Isa looked at Bryce in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You?" She scoffed, "Don't even think about it. Stay away from George. He is not for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce felt embarrassed. "Then is he...Osborne's stepping stone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa shot him a glance but did not respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce knew he had guessed correctly and could only smile wryly, "Lady Witch, why do you care so much about Osborne? With your status, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is my man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa suddenly interrupted Bryce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce's eyes widened in disbelief, his voice trembling, "You... What did you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa enunciated clearly, "I said he is my man. If I don't care about him, who should I care about? You? You're too weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry up and throw away your pathetic trident. Maybe then I would regard you a little higher. Otherwise, soon enough, you will be abandoned by the times."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce was instantly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at the Trident of Poseidon in his hand, gritting his teeth as he struggled immensely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lady Witch, what are you really planning?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are not yet worthy of knowing. We'll talk about it after you break through to Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The battle is over. It's time for you to make your entrance. Remember, don't tell him I was here, or I will go tear down your </span><span>Likreia</span><span> Mountain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Bryce felt a gust of wind pass by, and when he could see clearly again, Isa had already vanished without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mysterious Night Witch," Bryce murmured, no longer thinking too much about it. He quickly stepped through the waves toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne had just killed Bruce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Bruce was a Class AA, severely injured in his soul and spirit, he could not muster any strength to resist Osborne's terrifying power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His flesh was scattered on the surface of the sea, instantly contested by numerous sharks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the next second, all the sharks stopped moving. Their heads turned simultaneously toward one direction, trembling violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression changed as he sensed a terrible power approaching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly looked over and then sighed in relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Clarkson. You must have been around all along. I thought you were delayed by something," Osborne said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce forced a smile back. If it weren't for Isa's timely appearance, he would indeed have been delayed. However, even without him, Osborne would have still killed Chris and Bruce, so his arrival was inconsequential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What shocked Bryce the most was that Osborne was actually the man of the Night Witch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did he manage to do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Bryce stared intently at Osborne as if looking at a monster.</span></p></div>
