        <h1>Chapter 1385 Vance's Provocation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, had no intention of revealing his Essence Crystals just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, he sensed that even if they managed to submit the required amount in seven days, Patrick wouldn't let them off easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The priority now is to recover my strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick is a Superior Deity. If I can regain even one percent of my power, I could effortlessly crush him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then can I devise a way to change Harry and Amelia's situation and not just keep them here as exploited miners."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With cold determination flickering in his eyes, Osborne retired to his room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt the faint energy seeping from the revived tendrils of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, slowly healing his battered body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to eliminate a large number of </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only by doing so can the Lotus absorb enough of that high-grade death scent, accelerating my own recovery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This mining zone is the perfect place for me to slaughter </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, as the higher-level ones have already been dealt with here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'll rest for a bit and then head out again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne pondered his plan, suddenly, the door to the stone hut was kicked open with violent force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harry, Amelia, get your asses out here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That obnoxious voice belonged to the shifty-eyed Vance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell's gotten into you, Vance?" Harry's indignant voice came.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment, then hurried outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There</span><span> stood Vance, a look of arrogance smeared across his face as Harry and Amelia glared at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vance, are you asking for death? We've always tolerated you because we're all from the same village, but don't think we're scared of you! If you don't give us a good </span><span>reason today, don't blame us for being rude!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry looked </span><span>furious,</span><span> his gaze fixed on the shattered remains of their door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia mirrored his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Vance showed no fear. He sneered. "Reason? You want a reason? You think you can be rude to me? Hahaha! Then take a good look at this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Vance slowly pinned a bronze insignia to his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia's faces paled instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Assistant overseer! You've become Patrick's assistant?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vance's eyes gleamed with satisfaction as he looked at the shocked pair. "That's right! I'm now an assistant overseer! You lowly human miners are under my command now! Disobey, and I'll whip you till you bleed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia seethed with anger, yet they dared not respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As assistant overseer, Vance could, to some extent, act on Patrick's behalf and punish them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't expected Vance to actually rise from their ranks by currying favor with Patrick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vance smirked. "Harry, Amelia, are you scared now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Swift wants triple the Essence Crystals from you. Worried about the consequences if you can't produce them? Despite everything, we're still from the Rodriguez Village. If you behave, I might intercede on your behalf with Patrick."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry, knowing exactly what Vance wanted, still couldn't help but frown. "What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vance's smile widened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fixed his gaze on Amelia and declared, "What I want is simple. I want Amelia to marry me! Once she's my wife, we'll be family, and I'll do everything in my power to help you all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right now, I'm just an assistant overseer, but I'm confident I'll soon become the real overseer. If your sister Amelia marries me, we'll have a good life ahead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A glint of greed flickered in his eyes as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry, infuriated, retorted, "Vance, are you seriously trying to set your sights on my sister? Who do you think you are? You should take a long, hard look in the mirror; do you really think you're worthy of her? Get out! I want you to leave&mdash;now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Harry's words, Vance's anger flared. "Harry, what's with that attitude? You should consider it an honor that I'm interested in your sister! How dare you turn me down? Do you really want to test me? I could make your family's life a living hell if I wanted to!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry's fury escalated, and if it weren't for Amelia stepping in, he would have lunged at Vance right then and there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You lay a finger on my sister, and I swear I'll make you regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Harry looked ready to explode.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vance, slightly taken aback but trying to maintain his composure, scoffed. "Fine, fine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vance said, his voice dripping with disdain, "Harry, this is on you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You just wait; I'll make you beg me to marry your sister in no time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Vance stormed out.</span></p></div>
