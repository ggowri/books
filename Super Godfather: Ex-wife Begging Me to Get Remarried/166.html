        <h1>Chapter 166 Conflict</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne remained calm. When he observed the arrogant enforcement team members, his suspicions grew more certain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It must be that person who had returned!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's nominal fianc&eacute;, the man feared by Donna and the entire Radcliffe family, the future heir of the ancient Chevalier family, Apollo Chevalier!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Chevalier family had been influential in Skyefall for centuries, holding sway in both the underworld and high society. In terms of influence, not even the Radcliffe family could compare, and even the Godfather's power paled in certain respects to that of the Chevalier family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only family capable of making the Mayby City Enforcement Team strut around the Radcliffe Manor would be the Chevalier family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo's arrival exerted tremendous pressure on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what, Apollo was Clarissa's fianc&eacute;. Their marriage was arranged by the elders of the Radcliffe and Chevalier families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Osborne to complete his test as the heir, he inevitably had to become Apollo's enemy and take Clarissa away from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo's early appearance disrupted Osborne's plans, but there was no other choice now. He could only adapt as things unfolded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, a few imposing figures emerged from the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne noted their insignias, identifying them as mid-level leaders of the Enforcement Team, with the one in the lead being the deputy captain of the Mayby City Enforcement Team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a man in his thirties, standing nearly 6.5 feet tall, built like a bear, with a ferocious scar on his face that radiated a menacing aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man asked coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Captain Rudy, this man tried to force his way in. I stopped him, but he assaulted me and said that even if he killed me, nothing would happen to him. He even threatened to sue the enforcement team!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The enforcement team member immediately accused Osborne, his face full of contempt and mockery, as if saying, "You're done for."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Rudy Gay, the deputy captain of the enforcement team, looked even colder. He glanced down at Osborne with disdain in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you courting death?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know who we are? We are the Mayby City enforcement team. If you don't want to die, get out of here immediately, or I'll be unkind to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Rudy waved his hand, and the enforcement team members immediately raised their guns, all aiming at Osborne with cold expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Violet and the others' faces changed instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they did not hesitate, lifting their own guns and aiming at the enforcement team members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, they could only stand by Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only because Osborne was their captain, and seeing him humiliated brought them disgrace, but also because Osborne had saved their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During their recent expedition to the slums south of the city, they had been betrayed by Harris and ambushed. If Osborne hadn't arrived in time, they might well have perished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you planning to rebel?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rudy's face turned icy cold as he shouted angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne narrowed his eyes slightly and said calmly, "Are you all brainless? Do I need to repeat myself? This is the Radcliffe Manor, a sacred private domain. This is not a place for your enforcement team to show off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rudy frowned, his expression turning ugly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what if it's a private domain? Do you think the Radcliffe family would offend Enforcement Team for an outsider like you? Do you believe I could shoot you dead, and the Radcliffe family wouldn't pursue it, but instead help cover it up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne responded coldly, "I believe it! However, I bet you can't kill me! Want to try?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think I don't dare?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rudy aimed his gun at Osborne, disengaging the safety. The muzzle was less than 1.6 feet from Osborne's head. With a pull of the trigger, the bullet would instantly pierce Osborne's skull.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Violet and the others turned pale and quickly disengaged their gun safeties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, raised his hand, signaling them not to act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled at Rudy, showing no panic or fear in the face of the dark muzzle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even stepped forward, pressing the gun almost against his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said calmly, "Go ahead, shoot me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rudy's face grew intensely cold. Osborne's provocative stance filled him with fury, a hint of murderous intent flashing deep in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, he moved abruptly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you want to die, I'll grant your wish. Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rudy's finger pulled the trigger sharply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gunshot rang out suddenly, and smoke billowed from the barrel. Rudy's face initially bore a cold smirk, but it quickly turned to astonishment, then fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of piercing Osborne's head as expected, the bullet stopped mysteriously at the muzzle, hovering in front of Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The muzzle was only four inches from Osborne's head, but the bullet couldn't cross that four inches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you a mind control metahuman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rudy, as the deputy captain of the enforcement team, with his broad knowledge and experience, instantly grasped the key point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had used mind control to block the bullet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rudy's face darkened as he immediately tried to retreat, but it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered coldly, his ocular energy forming into a fist, which he slammed fiercely into Rudy's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rudy was sent flying, blood spurting wildly from his nose and mouth. The powerful blow flattened his nose, and he lay on the ground, unable to get up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing this, the other enforcement team members' faces changed drastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, they pulled their triggers at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Intense gunfire echoed through the quiet Radcliffe Manor.</span></p></div>
