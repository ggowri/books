        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know." Under the effect of the truth serum, Raymond spoke without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing his answer, Osborne frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Raymond not know?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond continued, "I just followed the orders from my superior. I don't know why they wanted to kill Clarissa, and I don't want to know about it. However, I can probably guess a little."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? What is it?" Osborne raised an eyebrow and became curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond said, "It is very likely related to her power. Her Holy Light Healing can stimulate people's potential and replenish vitality. She can prolong the dying person's life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I once heard that the Aberrants will return to Rosmandi, but a few old guys are the biggest obstacle. Only when they die can the Aberrants come back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The defenses around those old guys are extremely tight. Even the masters of the Aberrants have difficulty assassinating them. Fortunately, they are old, and they will die a natural death soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But as Clarissa's power enhanced, she could prolong the lives of those old guys for a long time. I guess the organization is worried about this happening, so they want to get rid of her in advance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Raymond finished speaking, Osborne was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Aberrants wanted to kill Clarissa because of her power, Holy Light Healing. Was that really it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just Raymond's guess, and there was no way to confirm whether it was true or not.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne asked, "How determined is the Aberrants to kill Clarissa? If you fail this time, will it send someone more powerful to kill her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond hesitated as if thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he said, "The organization asked me to kill her because the Class B metahumans are rare. For any organization, they are elite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once they have appeared, they would be easily monitored and suspected by various forces. Generally speaking, they won't come out easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Class B metahuman entering Rosmandi would be easily discovered by the Godfather's people. So I don't know whether the Aberrants will send a stronger metahuman to kill Clarissa. I think the possibility is not high. I don't think she is worth the organization taking the risk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not the King of the Aberrants, and I don't know what the King's thoughts, so everything is possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond's answer was useless to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued to ask a few more questions, but Raymond's answers weren't what he wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, Raymond was not a core member of the Aberrants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could not get any useful information, and the effect of the truth serum began to wear off. He didn't bother to ask anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was time to devour Raymond's lightning elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes turned cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Satan's Eye had reached level four, which was much stronger than level three. However, the new power of level four had not yet been activated, and it required the absorption of an elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whichever element's essence he owned, he would be able to have the corresponding power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lightning elemental was the first elemental Osborne chose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was one of the most powerful elementals in nature. It was not as hot as fire, but it was more bizarre and difficult to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could control the power of lightning elemental, Osborne's power attack ability would be significantly enhanced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Raymond was still unconscious, Osborne immediately began to devour his elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A light suddenly burst out from Osborne's left eye, enveloping Raymond's body. Osborne instantly sensed that there was an explosive source of power deep within Raymond's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The essence of the lightning elemental was integrated with Raymond's body, and it was impossible to separate it by ordinary means. However, in the light of Osborne's Satan's Eye, the essence of the lightning elemental had no resistance at all. It was separated bit by bit, flying out of Raymond's body and merging into Osborne's left eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a tingling sensation spreading throughout his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he vaguely felt that there were many invisible forces in the void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are these the lightning elemental?" Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was shocked. This feeling was extraordinary. He felt that there was an extra sensory organ in his body, and it could help him to sense the energy that ordinary people could not perceive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought about it, and soon, a flash of lightning appeared and struck not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was surprised, thinking, "It is indeed the power of the lightning elemental. I can control lightning and create it. From now on, I have one more power to deal with my enemies. How powerful my lightning is? How does it compare to Raymond's full-strength attack?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Raymond woke up. He widened his eyes in shock and trembled all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond roared madly, "You... What did you do to me? Why is my lightning elemental essence gone? Why can't I sense the power of lightning now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell did you do to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Losing the lightning elemental made him become an ordinary person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each metahuman could not accept this fact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond went crazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't bother to explain. He smiled, "Raymond, what do you think of my lightning?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, he used all his strength to control the lightning elemental in the void, gathering a massive bolt of lightning, which struck in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the bang of lightning, Raymond was dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said in disbelief, "You... You also have the Class C+ lightning elemental! Your lightning attack is even more powerful than my full-strength attack, almost reaching Class B!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can this be?"</span></p></div>
