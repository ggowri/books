        <h1>Chapter 640 Owen's Move</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since assassination wasn't working, Osborne had no problem going for a full assault. He had the strength to do it now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took out the Death Sickle but quickly put it away. "I almost forgot. These Medusas don't seem to be affected by mental attacks. They don't seem to have souls."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne began to think of alternatives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized that quickly inflicting significant damage on these Medusas was proving difficult. His most powerful attack right now was the Intermediate Level of lightning elemental, Thunder Explosion. However, Thunder Explosion was quite noisy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he didn't gather enough power, the Medusas would likely have time to prepare their defenses, and the effect of the Thunder Explosion would be limited. Another option was the Intermediate Level of light elemental, Dissolving Light. But Dissolving Light could only cause penetrating damage and was hard to make fatal. Plus, it could only affect one enemy at a time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "It looks like after this battle, I need to boost my abilities. I should at least master more Intermediate Level applications of other powers, like spatial power or dark power. If I could master a high-level application of any power, forming a power realm. Then even if I faced a Class AAA, I wouldn't need to fear them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne decided to go for a brute-force attack. "Let me crush them with sheer power. I hope this doesn't take too long."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, at the Draco Group headquarters in </span><span>Skyefall</span><span>, Owen was in a meeting. S</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since discovering that Osborne had earned 540 points, Owen felt intense jealousy and anger, along with a powerful sense of crisis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Currently, Owen was ranked fourth on the leaderboard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His score was negative in 2060, just 500 points more than Osborne's. If Osborne gained another 540 points, he would surpass Owen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen gripped his teeth and said, "We should send people to attack the lost rare metal mines. If Osborne alone could take back a mine, it means the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> don't have </span><span>strong defenses there. We can definitely reclaim all three rare metal mines."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent as everyone frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone advised, "Mr. Owen Augustine, we're already struggling to hold the headquarters. Sending forces to retake the mines now seems too risky."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen waved his hand and said seriously, "It's not risky. I'm suggesting this to relieve the pressure on our headquarters. Think about it. If we attack the metal mines, how will the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> react?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before anyone could respond, Owen continued, "The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> will surely send more high-level fighters to defend the mines. That means they'll weaken their forces attacking our headquarters, reducing our pressure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a confident smile, Owen added, "Osborne only killed four Class A enemies to reclaim a metal mine. That means the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' forces at the mines aren't very strong. We can send a small force and easily take them down, reclaiming the mines."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked at each other but was eventually convinced by Owen's argument.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone said, "Since Mr. Owen Augustine says so, we'll do as you say."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone echoed, "I also agree with the plan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen smiled and said, "Since everyone agrees, let's discuss who will attack the mines. Since we're doing this, let's go big. We'll split into three teams, each attacking a different mine. Each team will have two Class AA leaders and five Class A members. This strength should be more than enough to handle any surprises."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen started making arrangements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mother, Margaret, was from the powerful Powell family in Newport City, which had several Class AA experts. With ten elders from the Augustine family backing him, his support included over twenty Class AA fighters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sending just six Class AA fighters to attack the three rare metal mines wouldn't significantly impact the headquarters' defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one anticipated any issues with their plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the three teams set off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne was in the middle of an intense battle with six Medusas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three were Class AA, and three were Class A+. Right from the start, Osborne's terrifying strength took down two Class A Medusas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quickly, the last Class A+ Medusa was also destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the remaining three Class AA</span><span> Medusas were incredibly tough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite using all his skills, Osborne could only gain the upper hand. Killing them all was difficult. Their vitality was strong, and they could even transform into beasts. Their teamwork was flawless, making it hard for Osborne to find a weakness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fight was fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's brow furrowed as he used Thunder Explosion, only managing to injure one Medusa heavily. The other two saved her, and he couldn't get a kill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "This is tricky. Class AA enemies are indeed not easy to deal with. Beating them is one thing, but killing them is incredibly hard. I need to finish them off quickly. If a stronger Class AAA shows up, I'm in trouble. What should I do?"</span></p></div>
