        <h1>Chapter 1297 Make Our Move</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warriors of the Deschanel Clan were left utterly stunned as they watched the injured Blood Demon members. Despite their wounds, the warriors maintained an icy composure, showing no signs of panic or fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The injuries on their Divine Bodies were healing at a visible rate!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within just a few breaths, their wounds had completely mended, restoring them to peak condition. The Blood Demon members were ready to unleash their divine power once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Terrence and his companions paused their assault, the Blood Demon members stood firm; not a single one had fallen, and each warrior was back to their prime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This turn of events left Terrence and the others in a state of disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, breaking the silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It appears the Deschanel Clan's tricks are only so effective. If this is all you've got, then it's time for your clan to meet its end!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I told you, today, every last one of you from the Deschanel Clan will die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Blood Demon members, advance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his command, the Blood Demon warriors sprang into action, swiftly shifting from their defensive formation to an aggressive stance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon members launched their counterattack with ferocity, merging their divine power to compensate for any weaknesses in strength. Their combined assaults rained down on the Transcendent Deities and Superior Deities of the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One particularly stubborn warrior from the Deschanel Clan scoffed and chose to withstand the onslaught head-on, only to be sent flying, blood spewing from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the chaos, a Superior Deity from the Deschanel Clan was overwhelmed by the barrage of attacks, his Divine Body exploding in a horrific display, his agonized screams echoing through the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining members of the Deschanel Clan were truly dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon warriors were not only a solid wall of defense but also turned into a razor-sharp blade that pierced straight for their hearts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Transcendent Deity warriors found themselves injured, forced to rely on quick movements and evasive maneuvers just to survive the relentless onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic ensued among the Deschanel Clan warriors as they scrambled to regroup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched the chaos unfold, a satisfied smile spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Divine Shadow and God of Star stood in shock, witnessing the Blood Demon members overpowering the Deschanel Clan's Transcendent Deities and Superior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandma Divine Shadow, God of Star!" Osborne called out, snapping them back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They quickly turned their attention to him, their expressions a mix of awe and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's hidden strength had taken them by surprise!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before today, they hadn't regarded Junior and Intermediate Deities as much of a threat. They believed that no matter how many Junior and Intermediate Deities were, they could never truly challenge Transcendent Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here they were, nearly five thousand Junior and Intermediate Deities managing to dominate twenty-nine Transcendent Deities from the Deschanel Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yikes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Star and Divine Shadow exchanged serious glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They realized that if they were in the shoes of the Deschanel Clan's Transcendent Deities, facing the Blood Demon members, they wouldn't have a solid plan either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Attack?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon members would effortlessly counter their strikes. Even if they managed to breach the defenses and inflict damage, the Blood Demon warriors could heal almost instantaneously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Defend?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The combined firepower of the Blood Demon members was like a single entity in battle, nearly impossible to withstand!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only option left would be to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sole advantage the Deschanel Clan's Transcendent Deities had was their speed, but even that felt like a flimsy lifeline against the overwhelming might of the Blood Demon warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandma Divine Shadow, God of Star, it's our turn to step in! The Blood Demon members might be able to hold off and distract the Deschanel Clan's Transcendent Deity warriors, but unless the Deschanel Clan members are total morons, it's going to be incredibly difficult for the Blood Demon to take them down! So, we should make our move now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne finished speaking, Divine Shadow and God of Star nodded eagerly, their eyes sparkling with excitement and anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly, it's time for us to jump in!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we can just pin down a few of them, giving the Blood Demon members a chance to surround them, then... game over for the Deschanel Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're toast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow sneered, her gaze fixed on the Deschanel Clan Transcendent Deities, who were frantically dodging attacks from the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly; what Divine Shadow said aligned perfectly with his plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon members alone couldn't wipe out the Deschanel Clan; their Transcendent Deity warriors were simply too fast. If they decided to avoid battle and flee, the Blood Demon members wouldn't be able to stop them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with Osborne and Divine Shadow, God of Star joining the fray, the tide would turn!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the trio could just hold the Deschanel Clan warriors in place for a moment, the Blood Demon members could encircle them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And once trapped, no matter how fast they were, it would be curtains for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take care, both of you," Osborne said before his form vanished from the spot, using Phantom Steps to appear behind one of the Deschanel Clan's Transcendent Deity warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Transcendent Deity in question was skillfully dodging the Blood Demon's attacks while simultaneously unleashing his full power to counterattack, hoping to wear down the Blood Demon members through a hit-and-run strategy. Once the Blood Demon members were exhausted, he planned to finish them off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, this was the tactic all the Deschanel Clan Transcendent Deities were employing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But suddenly, he felt an uncanny sensation at his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A surge of imminent danger jolted through his senses.</span></p></div>
