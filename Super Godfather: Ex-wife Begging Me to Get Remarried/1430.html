        <h1>Chapter 1429 Counter</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne fixed a cold glare on the squad leader. He recognized him as Elroy Alick, a member of the same race as Jeffrey and, in a way, his younger brother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elroy had always been a bully, taking full advantage of his connection to Jeffrey to push around the likes of Lachlan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was no surprise that he was now targeting Osborne, flaunting his superiority with an air of arrogance. With Elroy's biting words, all eyes turned to Osborne, filled with a mix of amusement and disdain. No one seemed inclined to intervene, clearly entertained by the spectacle unfolding before them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Jeffrey chose not to step in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, Lachlan was just an insignificant human, and had it not been for the Essence Crystals Lachlan occasionally provided, Jeffrey would have kicked him out of the squad long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, watching Elroy browbeat Lachlan, he felt no inclination to protect Lachlan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey was standing firm at the entrance of the cave, pushing back against the relentless onslaught of the Deathborn. To Jeffrey, even if Elroy dared to point his finger in Lachlan's face and hurl insults, Lachlan would likely cower, forcing a fake smile and probably offering Elroy Essence Crystals just to appease him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, this had happened too many times before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But tonight was different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The so-called "Lachlan" was no longer the same person&mdash;Osborne had taken his place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Osborne wasn't the type to let anyone insult him or the entire Human Community without a fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne had already regained his status as a Superior Deity, but even if he hadn't, he still wouldn't back down any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, he knocked Elroy's finger away from his face and retorted with icy disdain, "Your squad members died because they were incompetent! Why is it that the other teams managed to survive while yours didn't?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're so useless yourself, why blame me for mocking you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you've got any guts, go out there and take down some Deathborns to avenge your comrades instead of cowering behind here, barking at me like a dog!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cavern fell deathly silent, an almost tangible hush blanketing the space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Jeffrey momentarily paused in his battle against the Deathborn, turning his head to stare at Osborne in shock, bewilderment painted across his face. Then, as if shaking off a daze, he resumed fighting, though the surprise lingered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other squad members stood frozen, astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of them had expected Osborne to strike back at Elroy, let alone with such ferocity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "Has Lachlan decided he doesn't want to be a part of the Wild Flame Army anymore?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elroy, too, was momentarily stunned. The numerous times he had humiliated Lachlan stood out in his mind, with the other man always smiling and handing over Essence Crystals in a meek apology.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he anticipated the same submissive response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead, "Lachlan" had fired back ferociously and even insulted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a heartbeat, Elroy's face flushed crimson, rage and murderous intent swirling in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lachlan, you're asking for it! Do you really think I won't kill you? You pathetic human&mdash;you dared to insult me! You're dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Elroy's fury erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a Transcendent Deity warrior, and he unleashed a surge of divine power, striking out at Osborne with a forceful slap aimed squarely at Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Around them, the other soldiers watched with cold, expectant stares, waiting for Elroy to make a brutal example of Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, the sound of a resounding slap echoed through the cave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To everyone's shock, it was Elroy who was sent flying, spinning through the air before crashing against the hard rock wall with a thud that reverberated throughout the cavern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A stunned silence enveloped the space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone stared wide-eyed, jaws dropped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The one who had just been struck was not Osborne but Elroy himself, knocked sideways as if he were nothing more than a ragdoll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Elroy launched his attack, Osborne reacted with lightning speed, his hand shooting out to land a blistering slap right across Elroy's face before he even had a chance to register what was happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't hold back; he poured all his strength into that strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that split second, the Malevolence Amulet hanging around Elroy's neck flared to life, glowing fiercely as it absorbed the impact of Osborne's blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, even with the amulet's protection, Elroy was sent sprawling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The activation of the Malevolence Amulet was a clear sign: Osborne's attack had posed a genuine threat to Elroy's life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had it not been for that amulet, Elroy might have been knocked out cold&mdash;or worse, killed&mdash;by that single slap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers stood frozen in disbelief, their faces a mixture of shock and astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A collective gasp echoed through the cavern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected Osborne to fight back, let alone with such ferocity that it forced Elroy's amulet to activate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pathetic fool!" Osborne sneered, his expression dripping with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Has he lost his mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whispers rippled through the crowd. They couldn't fathom how "Lachlan" dared to strike back. After all, Elroy was part of Jeffrey's bloodline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could he be so reckless? Does he really think he can survive this? Hitting Elroy is like declaring war on Jeffrey himself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew how ruthless Jeffrey could be. They imagined the worst for Osborne, picturing him at the mercy of Jeffrey's wrath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd's gaze shifted to Osborne, filled with scorn and pity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After all these years of putting up with it, and now he decides to fight back? He's as good as dead!"</span></p></div>
