        <h1>Chapter 1397 Help Harry and Amelia</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Harry and Amelia tirelessly dig for Essence Crystals, Osborne couldn't help but notice their sheer joy and excitement every time they unearthed a low-grade Essence Crystal. It struck him that what he had previously dismissed as worthless was, for them, incredibly important and precious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the human cultivators in </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, this was the norm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They lived in the cracks of survival, where every single low-grade Essence Crystal was vital&mdash;essential for their survival and a glimmer of hope for becoming stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, not having been born in </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, had never fully grasped this reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he had the means to easily acquire a wealth of Essence Crystals, he had never bothered to collect them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But seeing Harry and Amelia's enthusiasm stirred something within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have to change the plight of human cultivators in </span><span>Celestara</span><span>! Why should they toil endlessly just to hand over most of their hard-earned Essence Crystals to the Dark Deity Legion? They struggle day in and day out and often end up with nothing to show for it. If they can't meet their quotas, they face punishment, or worse, death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celestara</span><span> is the homeland of humanity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dark Deity Legion has ruined this place and enslaved our people to mine for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's outrageous! One day, I will turn the tables and make the Dark Deity Legion mine for humanity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for now, I need to start by improving Harry and Amelia's situation. I have plenty of Essence Crystals that I don't need at the moment. Instead of just handing them over, I'll hide them in the mine they're about to dig into so they can find them themselves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that resolve, Osborne sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using the Eclipsing Mantra to cloak his presence, he carefully placed Essence Crystals&mdash;one after another&mdash;into the area where the siblings were about to mine, dramatically increasing the density of Essence Crystals there by dozens, even hundreds of times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them were even a hundred mid-grade Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That should do it. With this many Essence Crystals, they'll be set for a while and finally have enough to train and improve!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any more, and it might raise some eyebrows," he thought, then settled down to observe from a hidden spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia swung their massive mining picks, striking the hard rock vein with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These picks weren't ordinary tools; they were divine artifacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, even with such weapons, their progress was slow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne estimated that it would take the siblings at least a year to fully extract everything from this small vein.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This particular vein held only about 30 thousand low-grade Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given their quota, they needed to submit one thousand three hundred low-grade Essence Crystals each month, totaling fifteen thousand six hundred for the year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all their hard work, they would be lucky to keep even half for themselves!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that was in this deeper section, where the density of Essence Crystals was significantly higher than in the shallower layers. If they had been mining closer to the surface, finding enough to meet their quota would have been a small miracle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder Harry and Amelia have had such a tough time! Just the monthly quota of Essence Crystals must have nearly crushed them, leaving little time for anything else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But thankfully, I'm here now, and that's about to change!" Osborne murmured to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he watched Amelia bring her pick down with a loud crack, shattering a large rock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Amelia's excited gasp pierced the air. Peering behind the rock, she was utterly stunned to see countless Essence Crystals embedded in the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harry! Come quick!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was breathless, eyes wide with disbelief as she gazed at the treasure before her, half-convinced she was lost in a dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry, thinking something was terribly wrong, sprinted over with his mining pick raised, ready to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when he reached Amelia and caught sight of what lay before them, he froze in a mix of disbelief and awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both siblings stood there, mouths agape, staring at the glimmering Essence Crystals encrusted in the rock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia swallowed hard, struggling to process what she was seeing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this even possible? How many are there?" she murmured, and then her excitement bubbled over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia added, "Harry, pinch me! Make sure I'm not dreaming! Just look at this&mdash;there must be at least a hundred Essence Crystals here! Oh my god, did we just strike a vein of high-grade crystals?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry's eyes lit up with realization. "It's got to be a high-grade vein! There's no way the density of Essence Crystals in a low-grade or even a mid-grade vein could be this high!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And wait... not only are there hundreds of low-grade Essence Crystals, but look closely&mdash;there are several mid-grade ones too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Mid-grade?" Amelia gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She squinted, heart racing, and then let out a jubilant scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The light blue Essence Crystals&mdash;these really are mid-grade!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! Each mid-grade Essence Crystal is worth a hundred low-grade ones! Harry, we're rich!"</span></p></div>
