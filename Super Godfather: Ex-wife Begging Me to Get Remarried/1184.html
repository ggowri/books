        <h1>Chapter 1183 Kill or Not</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain, who had been silent all this while, finally spoke up, "Hmph! What a waste!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Using such a precious resource like the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity's core energy to boost your elemental essence?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's just disgraceful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your elemental essence would reach Level Five eventually if you just invested the time. You've squandered two cores of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've really missed the mark."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne simply smiled at Cain's words, sensing a hint of jealousy from his tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As far as Osborne was concerned, what mattered was whether he felt it was worth it, and he certainly thought so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "Elemental essence can be improved over time? Sure, but I don't have that kind of luxury. How long would it take to advance both my dark and space elemental essences to Level Five naturally?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Years? Decades?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm not here for a leisurely stroll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If one core of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity can save me years of training, then it's a huge win."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided to ignore Cain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the fusion of the Lotus with his body was complete, granting him initial immortality, he would be ready to deal with Cain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain, fused within him along with the lotus, could see everything Osborne did, which was unacceptable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, Osborne knew Cain bore him ill will.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain intended to use Osborne's body to escape the hidden depths of the earth, eventually regain his strength, and return to seize the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity for himself. Osborne was onto him from the start.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Osborne was wrong, Cain still deserved to die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the God of Sin, Cain had countless lives on his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This demon, this monster, was a ticking time bomb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, Osborne quietly awaited the completion of the Lotus' fusion with his body, preparing to strike against Cain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kid, why so silent? You're on the brink of achieving partial immortality with the Lotus' second phase of fusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This should be a joyous occasion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But this is merely the beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to know how to proceed to the third, fourth, or even fifth phase of fusion with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow. "How do I do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain smirked, not revealing the method right away but instead saying, "Once the second phase is complete, the roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity will permeate through every cell in your body, granting you immortality as long as your soul remains intact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When you complete the third phase, some of the roots will detach and enter those you've sired as Blood Clan descendants, allowing you not only to control them better but also to bestow immortality upon them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "So completing the third phase of the fusion with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity means my Blood Clan progeny could also achieve immortality?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This means I could make every member of the Blood Demon immortal! Imagine how much more formidable the Blood Demon will become!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A well-trained and coordinated team, fearing nothing&mdash;not even death&mdash;what level of strength could they unleash?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just the thought of it filled Osborne with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked, "And what happens after the fourth phase of fusion?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain smiled subtly, "Reaching the fourth phase means achieving true immortality. At that point, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity's roots will enter your soul sea, connecting with your very soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if your soul is obliterated, the lotus can resurrect you. As long as it remains within you, you'll be invincible. No one will be able to kill you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was thrilled at the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"True immortality? Just by reaching the fourth phase? I must complete this fusion as quickly as possible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He resolved to make it happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Cain casually added, "However, fusing to the fourth phase isn't easy. Back in the day, I barely survived the process by sheer luck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Without the right method, your chances are slim to none. It's ten times more perilous than anything you've faced before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, since we're partners, I'll share how to achieve the third and fourth phase fusions with you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But right now, you're too weak. It's not time to reveal it yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback by Cain's words, furrowing his brow in suspicion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pondered, "Why is he saying this now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could he know I plan to kill him? Is he upping his value to me on purpose, dangling the fusion method so I'll hesitate to finish him off?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne fell silent, his mind racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To kill or not to kill?"</span></p></div>
