        <h1>Chapter 427 Driven to the Edge</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan clenched his fists tightly, his face flushed with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued, "Your father was exceptional, and you idolized him since you were young. You believed he was far superior to Yulissa's father, Allen, and that he should have been the head of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But instead, your grandpa chose to pass the position to Allen, not your father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're a smart guy, so you started having doubts right then and there. You wondered if your father might not actually be your grandfather's biological son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, years ago, you snuck some hair samples to the hospital for a paternity test, and the results confirmed your suspicions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your father and Isaac aren't related by blood! Neither are you and Isaac. In fact...neither of you has any ties to the Augustine family whatsoever. You're not an Augustine at all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, Ryan began to breathe heavily, his eyes bloodshot as he glared at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a slight smile. "Ryan, there's always a trail when something's done. Do you need me to show you the evidence of the paternity test you took back then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan bit his lip, remaining silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged and continued, "When you found out you didn't have Augustine blood, your mindset changed. You hid this secret, thinking Isaac would never tell anyone. As long as you were outstanding enough, you believed you'd have a chance to become the head of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But unfortunately, you were wrong! Isaac truly treated you like a grandson, but he also knew the Augustine family wasn't his alone! No matter how much he loved you, he could never allow someone without the Augustine family blood to become the head of the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You felt it, didn't you? That's why you started to hate Isaac! You don't just hate him. No, you hate everyone in the Augustine family. You think you're good enough, that you should have been the heir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When you realized you had no chance, you began to take revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You started working with Alexander Paltrow, giving him Augustine family secrets. You even pushed him to strike first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you going to deny any of this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's words hung in the air, leaving the room in stunned silence. Everyone was too shocked to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it... true?" Yulissa murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan was equally shocked. "Could this be real? Ryan... I still can't believe it. Was Ryan the traitor all along?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough!" Ryan suddenly roared, glaring at Nathan. "Drop your act! Haven't you all already decided to believe him? You've already convinced yourselves that I'm the traitor, so why bother pretending you don't want to believe it in front of me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan was at a loss for words. He bit his lip, staring at the seemingly crazy Ryan, but ultimately said nothing more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan turned his gaze to Osborne, his voice cold. "Osborne, so what if you've said all this? It's all just your speculation! Yes, I've known for a long time that I don't have Augustine blood, but that doesn't mean I betrayed the Augustine family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but shake his head, a look of pity on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan was just struggling in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He calmly pulled out a vial of medication and said in a cool tone, "Ryan, it doesn't matter if you don't admit it. Do you know what I have here? This is the Draco Group's truth serum, the highest grade of truth serum!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even a regular Class A master can't help but spill their secrets after taking this. They'll answer whatever you ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you refuse to confess, I'll have no choice but to use the truth serum on you! Even though just one dose costs a billion, it's worth it if we can find the mole."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Ryan heard this, his expression changed drastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took two steps back and shouted angrily, "What gives you the right to use the truth serum on me? Everyone has secrets! Why do you think you can treat me like this? Just because you suspect me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This truth serum has side effects! What if you use it, and I'm not the mole you're looking for? How will you make it right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just afraid I'll steal your inheritance, so you want to destroy me with the side effects of the truth serum!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, "Ryan, calm down. Since you refuse to confess, I'm going to use the truth serum on you, and no one can stop me. But, since you're worried that I'm trying to ruin you, let me make this clear. If you're not the mole in the Augustine family, then I, Osborne... will hand over the inheritance to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was shocked to hear this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't hesitate any longer. He walked toward Ryan, truth serum in hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to be the Augustine heir, right? You swear you're not the mole? Then take the truth serum! Prove you're innocent, and the inheritance is yours!" Osborne took one step closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan began to back away, his face twisted in conflict, with a flicker of madness in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had driven him into a corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Osborne closed in, Ryan snapped. "Osborne, you ruined me! I won't let you get away with it! I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Ryan unleashed his powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A crushing force weighed down on Osborne, and in an instant, Ryan drew a dagger, pressing it against Osborne's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nobody move, or he dies!" Ryan snarled, face twisted in fury.</span></p></div>
