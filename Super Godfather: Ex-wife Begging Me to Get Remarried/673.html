        <h1>Chapter 673 I'm the King of the Vampires?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne recalled the introduction of the Blood Cross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Cross of Cain was a divine artifact. It belonged to Cain, the ancestor of vampires, possessed unimaginable magical power, and was rumored to be capable of imprisoning a person's soul and bestowing vampiric abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A crazy idea suddenly emerged in Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bestow vampiric powers... Could it mean that after obtaining the Blood Cross, I can grant the power of vampires to anyone and help them rapidly grow?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This thought startled Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his understanding, all the metahumans were chosen ones. It wasn't easy for people </span><span>to awaken their supernatural powers. Only a few top-notch research organizations in the world had developed special genetic potions that allowed ordinary people to obtain supernatural power at a great cost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But these potions were usually extremely expensive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could the Blood Cross of Cain really allow me to bestow vampire powers upon anyone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne decided to give it a try.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He called for Valentin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin was the overall manager of </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security, a talented manager whose strength had reached Class B, which meant he wasn't weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, given the current situation, Class B strength was not enough to make a significant impact, at best only serving as cannon fodder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had known Valentin for a long time. They had fought side by side before, and Osborne would never treat him as cannon fodder. He hoped that Valentin could become stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, everyone's talent had limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin reaching Class B was already his limit. It was nearly impossible for him to continue breaking through and become a Class A master in this lifetime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Osborne again, Valentin showed great respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that Osborne had already become incredibly powerful, surpassing his imagination. The help he could offer Osborne was merely helping him earn money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, you were looking for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly. "Valentin, there's no need to be so polite. We're old friends. I called for you here because there's something I want to test with you. It might be a bit dangerous, but it could also bring you great benefits and help you rapidly improve your strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can think it over and decide if you want to try it. If you're unwilling, I won't blame you. You'll still be the overall manager of </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security, and I will find someone else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin was stunned upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, his eyes lit up. "Boss, is it really possible for me to quickly improve my strength? I'm willing to try, even if there's danger. I don't care."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin was resolute in his decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Good! Rest assured. I will do my best to ensure your safety!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Osborne didn't immediately proceed with the experiment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He brought Clarissa over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Clarissa present, even if something unexpected happened to Valentin, she could instantly use her divine healing ability to save him. At the very least, Valentin would live.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa quickly arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She first noticed the change in people from Training Base No. 6 and asked shockingly, "Are they all Class A or above?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, all the members of Training Base No. 6 had finished absorbing the </span><span>blood energy. Among the 520 members, twenty were Class AA, while the rest were either Class A or Class A+.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So many masters gathered together and stood straight like an army, their faces filled with fiery admiration as they looked at Osborne. Anyone who saw such a scene would undoubtedly be shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and gave a brief introduction to their situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he explained his plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was once again surprised, but then she nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pulled Osborne to a corner and whispered, "Osborne, you guessed it right! After reaching Class AA this time, I gained some strange memories in my mind, including information about the Blood Cross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's true that the Blood Cross can help bestow vampire powers. Just a tiny bit of its energy can grant anyone the power to transform into a vampire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Furthermore, those vampires will become your most loyal aides. They can never betray you or harm you. With just a thought, you can strip them of their power and make them die instantly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not only can you distribute the power of the Blood Cross to them and help them grow rapidly, but when the time comes, you can also reclaim their power using the Blood Cross to enhance your strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In short, you are their king!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have fused with the Blood Cross, and all vampires can be considered your subjects. Unless their realms are much higher than yours, they cannot defy you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are the king of the vampires!"</span></p></div>
