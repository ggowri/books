        <h1>Chapter 1311 The Battle Began</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was tired of wasting time and urged Terrence to get started.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence made an effort to calm himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This fight was about his life; despite the overwhelming impression Osborne had made, he needed to focus and treat it with the seriousness it deserved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing that Osborne was merely an Intermediate Deity increased Terrence's sense of confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An Intermediate Deity like Osborne could indeed defeat a standard Transcendent Deity, but Terrence was far from ordinary. He had once reached the pinnacle of Deity Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His skills, mastery over power, and combat experience surpassed those of the average Transcendent Deity by leaps and bounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne might have been an Intermediate Deity capable of taking down regular Transcendent Deities, but Terrence didn't believe for a second that Osborne could</span><span> be better than</span><span> him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see what you've got!" Terrence declared, his divine power flaring up dramatically, towering like a god of war.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me show you, young one, what true power looks like!" he added, a fierce grin on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm </span><span>starting the </span><span>game!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was eager to gauge just how he measured up against one of the most formidable Transcendent Deity warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence would make for an excellent test.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had no trouble dealing with ordinary Transcendent Deity warriors, and his strength placed him on equal footing with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Terrence was different&mdash;if he could defeat Terrence, then on this Blue Planet, where even the peak Transcendent Deity was the limit, Osborne would no longer fear anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not even a reincarnated Deity King would stand a chance against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here I come&mdash;watch out now!" Osborne announced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Divine Shadow and God of Star looked at them intently, the battle commenced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne vanished from his position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone felt a blip in the air; suddenly, Osborne was right behind Terrence, delivering a powerful kick aimed straight at his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed was blinding, leaving Terrence with no time to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In truth, there was indeed no time for him to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne utilized his time power to freeze Terrence's moment in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Terrence's strength was greater; Osborne's time manipulation only managed to freeze him for half a second. Before he could launch his attack, the flow of time returned to Terrence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he couldn't stop Osborne from closing in, Terrence still had enough time to evade the blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he chose not to evade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence braced himself to take the hit with pure divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's kick collided with Terrence's divine power shield, sending a shockwave through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence was propelled backward, while Osborne staggered back, astonished at the force of his opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence regained his footing with a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your techniques are indeed peculiar; I didn't even know how you suddenly appeared behind me! Your power is formidable, matching that of an ordinary Transcendent Deity perfectly. Any regular Transcendent Deity would have no hope of enduring such a blow&mdash;you'd grind them down eventually."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His confidence was palpable as he continued, "But as I mentioned, I'm not just any Transcendent Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your strength might be impressive, but it won't break my defenses. I even have special means to reflect your power back at you. You must be feeling the strain, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, while I must admit your abilities are unusual and your strength commendable, you're not a threat I can't handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In fact, it's safe to say you're bound to lose."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but nod in agreement despite the slight ache in his right leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Terrence has a point. He doesn't quite feel like the Transcendent Deity warriors I've faced before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to think I'm beaten already? That's a bit rash, isn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold snort, Osborne retorted, "Terrence, the battle's just begun. Getting ahead of yourself, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take this!" he shouted, his right eye suddenly blazing with a blinding light that engulfed Terrence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The petrification power of Medusa's Gaze was activated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence's body rapidly sprouted layers of stone, the petrifying energy ensnaring him like quicksand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each joint felt as though cement had been poured into it, rendering his movements painfully sluggish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence scowled, his divine power flaring as he tried to dispel the sensation, but it was a tough battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Such potent petrification power?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even my divine power struggles to counter it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But just like that, you think you can take me down? Dream on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne merely smiled, a glint of mischief in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be so hasty. The fight's just heating up! Abyssal Spiral!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying vortex began to form rapidly, growing larger and larger until it spanned six miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The resulting menacing sucking force finally compelled Terrence to be serious, sensing the threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne showed no signs of stopping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Space Collapse!" he bellowed.</span></p></div>
