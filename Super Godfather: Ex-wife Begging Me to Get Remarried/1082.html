        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm? Something's off!" Osborne furrowed his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne observed Gerardo crash to the ground, blood spilling from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the apparent severity of Gerardo's injuries, Osborne held back, sensing that something wasn't right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's injury seemed far too easy to accomplish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a man who had merged with the remains of two formidable divine beings: the corpse of Goddess Medusa and that of the Minotaur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The latter brought him fierce power and unparalleled defense, while the former provided him with astonishing healing abilities and petrifying power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How strong was the Minotaur's defense?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't say for sure, but he had faced the Tauren King, a Class S clone whose defenses were near impenetrable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His own experiences had shown him that without a unique strategy, breaking through that kind of defense was no small feat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Slave nutrient solution Osborne had absorbed included Minotaur's heart blood, which enhanced his skin and physique dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If just a taste could boost his defense so much, then Gerardo, fused with a full Minotaur corpse, should possess a truly formidable defense of his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, here Gerardo lay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ease with which Osborne had struck him gave Gerardo pause; something didn't add up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of pressing the attack, he remained alert, watching Gerardo's every move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crashing to the ground, Gerardo lay there motionless, as if he had sustained a life-threatening injury, making it seem like just one more strike from Osborne would seal his fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as Osborne hesitated, Gerardo suddenly sneered, springing back to his feet with a glacial glare that betrayed none of the earlier turmoil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a far cry from the wounded foe Osborne had just seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The earlier scene of blood pouring from him had been an elaborate play staged to deceive Osborne into closing the distance so he could deliver a fatal counterattack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately for him, his ruse had unraveled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The horns atop Gerardo's head began to emit a faint black glow, but with Osborne keeping his distance, the dark light slowly faded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression twisted in anger as Gerardo shouted, "How did you know I wasn't actually hurt? So many chances to finish me off, and you don't take me? I killed your sister, and you're burning with rage over that, yet here you are, not taking the shot?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's response was as cold as ice. "I just figured you couldn't be taken down that easily. Besides, if you went down so quickly, I'd have no rush to finish you. I'd be able to kill you whenever I wanted!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo sneered, saying, "So you weren't fooled after all. Let's take this to the next level! I've got to admit, I didn't expect you to resist my petrification power. This battle just got a lot more interesting. It's been ages since anyone's pushed me to fight seriously!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Gerardo cracked his neck, an ominous aura rising around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His power surged, exuding a palpable intensity, his battle spirit igniting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time to fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Gerardo shifted into attack mode.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black glow from his horns intensified as he charged forward, leaving a hazy afterimage in his wake. He disappeared only to reappear right before Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne narrowed his eyes, sensing the imminent threat. "What is this..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The answer came at him like a freight train&mdash;Gerardo's Bull Charge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The collision was like thunder. The ferocity of Gerardo's attack sent Osborne crashing forcefully against the ground, flesh flying in every direction as his body exploded into a gruesome spectacle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo, propelled by the impact, maintained his fierce posture, barreling forward for over a thousand yards before finally coming to a stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he regained his stance, anger flickered across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the tremendous speed of his charge, he had hit nothing but air. The splintered remnants and bloody mess he had created were nothing more than an afterimage left behind by a swift Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, several hundred yards away, Osborne stood, a cold smirk etched across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, now it makes sense why you pretended to be injured&mdash;to lure me in! Your Bull Charge is undeniably strong, and it comes at lightning speed, but charging straight ahead? As long as I've got enough reaction time, you won't touch me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo scoffed, but there was a glimmer of irritation in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're getting a bit cocky too soon. My tricks don't end there! Watch this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Osborne could react, Gerardo's form vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every nerve in Osborne's body lit up with alarm. A faint ripple in space caught his attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Interdimensional travel combined with the Bull Charge? He's coming from the side!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the moment he recognized Gerardo's sudden appearance, it was already too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's mastery of spatial power eclipsed Osborne's, and the speed at which he executed the interdimensional travel left no room for escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne barely had time to prepare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Martial art aura!" Osborne shouted, channeling his energy in a desperate bid to shield himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was futile. Gerardo's horns radiated a sickly black light as they crashed into the martial art aura, tearing it apart like paper. Before Osborne could fully brace himself, the horns pierced through, striking deep into his flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne spat blood as he was sent flying.</span></p></div>
