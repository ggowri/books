        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Has the attack from the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> already begun so soon? Have we already lost one of the rare metal mining areas?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lance's face looked extremely gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Losing a rare metal mining area would result in a deduction of 500 points. To make up for such a loss, they must either take back the rare metal mining area or kill 500 ordinary members of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> or 50 Class A masters of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, 500 points were definitely not easy to obtain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, just as the selection of the heir had only just begun, he had already lost 500 points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lance was extremely angry. He raised his wrist and looked at the Draco Star Wristlet on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was now a ranking list on his Draco Star Wristlet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were only six names on the list, namely Vincent, Matthew, Owen, Emma, Osborne and him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, the top five people all had 0 points, and only his name was ranked last, with a score of negative 500 points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lance's expression became even more gloomy at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The war has begun!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said sternly, "Gather the men immediately. I will personally lead them to take back this rare metal mining area. These 500 points must not be lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression was filled with determination for battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Scott immediately stopped him and said, "Mr. Lance Augustine, don't act rashly! Since the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> had started a war, they must have made preparations. It will definitely not be a small fight! We don't know how many enemies there are in the rare metal mining area and what their strength is.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we rush over recklessly, we might fall into an ambush! What we need to do now is quickly set up our defenses and send out our intelligence personnel to gather information about the enemy as soon as possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Lance was immediately furious, saying, "Damn it! Why did the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> choose to attack </span><span>Oillpuee</span><span>, where I am stationed? They caught me off guard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite saying this, he still calmed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Immediately send all intelligence personnel to investigate the situation. The remaining two rare metal mining areas must not be lost! Act now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his order was given, everyone started taking action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd split into two groups and quickly rushed to two other rare metal mining areas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, more bad news came.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lance Augustine, something happened! Our two industries in </span><span>Tageoair</span><span> were breached by the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lance's face was gloomy, and he waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already decided to give up these two industries. After all, they only amounted to a total of 200 points in value.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lance Augustine, something bad has happened! We..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, bad news came one after another. The six ordinary industries that Lance gave up were quickly conquered by the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> within just half an hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Up to now, his points had reached negative 1,100 points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, they didn't even see the enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lance's anger grew as he clenched his fists. He felt a sense of foreboding in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The offensive of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> was too fierce!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lance Augustine, something has happened! Another rare metal mining area of ours has been occupied by the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>! The people we sent to guard it has engaged in a battle with the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, resulting in heavy casualties! We lost a Class AA elder and six Class A masters!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the new news came, Lance stood up suddenly with an incredible look on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you say?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Has another rare metal mining area been occupied by the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>? Have we lost another Class AA elder?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face turned extremely red, and he suddenly felt dizzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was a Class AA elder!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he die just like that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There </span><span>were</span><span> only a dozen or so Class AA masters on his side, and now he hadn't even killed a single enemy, but already he had lost a Class AA elder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lance felt a little dizzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked up at the sky and seemed to see endless rolling dark clouds sweeping towards him, trying to drown him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the situation with the last rare metal mining area? Contact the people there immediately!" Lance shouted loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone started to make contact, but soon, his face turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lance Augustine, something terrible has happened! The last rare metal mining area is now under attack and can no longer withstand the attack! We have lost another Class AA elder! The strength of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> is very strong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems that there is a Class AAA master!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Lance heard this, his body shook, and his face turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One place lost!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another place lost!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There </span><span>were</span><span> a total of ten industries in </span><span>Oillpuee</span><span> that needed to be protected. Except for the </span><span>Oillpuee</span><span> Headquarters of Draco Group, all other industries had been breached by the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> in a short period of time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The offensive of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> was too fierce!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It couldn't be stopped. It couldn't be stopped at all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was there a Class AAA master taking action?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lance's face turned pale, and he gritted his teeth and said, "Call everyone back immediately. We will guard the </span><span>Oillpuee</span><span> Headquarters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the next second, someone said in panic, "Mr. Lance Augustine, something terrible has happened. Our intelligence personnel </span><span>has</span><span> discovered that a large number of masters from the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> are heading towards our location!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their target is the </span><span>Oillpuee</span><span> Headquarters!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lance Augustine, there are too many enemies, and they are too strong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For your safety, we have to retreat quickly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Lance trembled and almost fell down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Were a large number of masters from the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> heading towards them? Was the quantity too overwhelming? Were they exceptionally powerful?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Were they telling him to retreat?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only the first day of the war, or even just a few hours had passed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Oillpuee</span><span> that he was in charge of defending was about to be completely lost amidst the overwhelming offensive of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>?!</span></p></div>
