        <h1>Chapter 74 New Ability at Level Three</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Money is just a number. But Satan&rsquo;s Eye is related to my strength and whether I can complete more successor tests. I must improve it as soon as possible. As long as I become stronger, I can make more money in the future.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne took a deep breath and picked up the entire piece of Imperial Green diamond. He opened Satan&rsquo;s Eye and placed the Imperial Green diamond tightly on his left eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In an instant, Osborne felt as if his left eye came alive and was twitching slightly. At the same time, a powerful suction force spread.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne felt that a strange power surged out from the Imperial Green diamond. His left eye absorbed it. Suddenly, his left eye felt extremely clear and comfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His eyes became brighter and brighter, as brilliant and profound as the Milky Way. Some changes that were difficult for science to explain were taking place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Half an hour later, everything finally stopped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this time, a third silver star appeared in Osborne&rsquo;s left eye. Although these three stars were tiny and could not be seen without careful observation, they were extremely bright.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Satan&rsquo;s Eye reached level three,&rdquo; Osborne whispered. He could clearly feel that Satan&rsquo;s Eye had become more powerful. Both his dynamic and static vision had been improved. His ability to see through things was also stronger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But what made Osborne most happy was the new ability of Satan&rsquo;s Eye in level three.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Manipulating matter?&rdquo; Osborne murmured. He wanted to try it immediately. But when he suddenly saw the diamond in his hand, he was surprised. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not completely destroyed! It&rsquo;s just that the quality has changed from Imperial Green diamond to ordinary diamond. It&rsquo;s still a top-grade diamond. It is worth at least over 10 billion dollars!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was thrilled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He thought that this piece of Imperial Green diamond would be completely ruined and worthless. But it turned out that its quality was only reduced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I will give it to Alison later.&rdquo; Osborne carefully put down the diamond and began to test the new ability of Satan&rsquo;s Eye. According to what Godfather said, when Satan&rsquo;s Eye reached the third level, Osborne could control matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne opened Satan&rsquo;s Eye and stared at Draco Model H mini-handgun. He whispered in his mind, &ldquo;Take the gun out of the holster.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The next second, something magical happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne felt like he had an invisible pair of hands. He nimbly unhooked the holster, took out the pistol, aimed the muzzle at the distance, and pulled the trigger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A slight gunshot was heard. A vase shattered in the distance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was extremely surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">All these movements were easy and flexible for him. The invisible pair of hands were just like a part of his body. He could even do many more things than before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know my limit&hellip;&rdquo; he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne used the top-grade Imperial Green diamond to upgrade Satan&rsquo;s Eye. In theory, this upgrade was perfect.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">So, Satan&rsquo;s Eye would be more robust than usual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Let me try how much weight I can control.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne left the room and came to the hospital&rsquo;s backyard. Osborne used some huge lead blocks to test his strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The smallest lead block weighed only 20 pounds. The largest lead block weighed more than four thousand pounds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne first came to the smallest lead block and opened Satan&rsquo;s Eye. His pupil light covered the lead block. The lead block instantly flew up and floated in front of Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy.&rdquo; Osborne was delighted. He came to the lead block that weighed 100 pounds. He lifted the lead block easily and moved it flexibly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then he came to the lead block that weighed 200 pounds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This time, although he lifted the lead block, the speed of movement was greatly reduced. Osborne felt the difficulty for the first time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Finally, he felt the limit of Satan&rsquo;s Eye when he tried to lift the lead block, which was 800 pounds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne could barely lift that lead block and move it at all. He only held on for ten seconds. He was sweating, and his eyes were sore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;It seems that my current limit is to control an 800-pounds object. However, as the level of Satan&rsquo;s Eye increases, this limit will definitely increase. If I want to maintain the flexibility of manipulating objects, the weight cannot exceed 100 pounds and the distance cannot exceed 33 feet.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne roughly understood the capability of the third level.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Overall, he was very satisfied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The ability to manipulate matter was similar to mind control. His combat methods would become more flexible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If the situation at the Radcliffe Manor reappeared, Osborne wouldn&rsquo;t have to brave the hail of bullets to get the riot shield. Now, with a glance, the riot shield would fly to his side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Can I use Satan&rsquo;s Eye to control the bullets that are coming at me at high speed? If I can, I won&rsquo;t be afraid of bullets shooting at me,&rdquo; Osborne said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A thought suddenly emerged in his mind. He became excited. &ldquo;I am going to try it now.&rdquo;</p></div>
