        <h1>Chapter 1155 Evacuation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dave said, "Mr. Reinhart, just hang on a bit longer. Reinforcements are on their way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to Newport City myself to get those reinforcements&mdash;no matter what it takes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic coursed through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the other factions in Eidolon City decided to retreat, who would stand against the oncoming Dark Exotic Beasts?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Carey family's ancestral land was right here; they were the first to be in the line of fire!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time aid arrived, the Carey family could be devastated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Finn replied tersely, "Then hurry and find those reinforcements!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can't hold this position any longer! We've already lost over a hundred lives, and if we keep defending, who knows how many more will fall?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've decided to pull back. Once the Augustine family from Newport City sends help, we'll return. But to secure this rift, they'll need to send at least dozens of Class S Warriors our way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you honestly think you can convince the Augustine family to send that many Class S Warriors?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind him, members of the various factions shook their heads in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, they shared the same skepticism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their mind, the entire Rosmandi was in chaos, with Beast Tides occurring left and right. Everyone was calling for help from the Augustine family. How many Class S Warriors could the Augustine family mobilize?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way they could spare dozens for Class S Warriors!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finn said, "Let's go back and wait. If the Augustine family really sends someone to help us, we'll come back and join the fight. If not... well, we figure out a way to make our escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eidolon City just isn't safe anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dave's face went pale at that. "You're ready to abandon Eidolon City? What about the million ordinary citizens living here? Without our protection, how will they survive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finn smirked, a cruel gleam in his eyes. "If we're barely making it ourselves, how do you expect us to worry about others? We have to preserve our strength. As long as we have that, we can rebuild anywhere! Let those ordinary folks fend for themselves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a dismissive wave, Finn turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dave insisted, his voice rising in desperation, "You can't just up and leave like this! You're all wealthy families, Ancient Families&mdash;your roots are here, cultivated by those ordinary people! Now that danger is at our doorstep, you choose to run?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And what about the energy in the rift? The ambient energy here is dense; training here boosts your level at a rate far beyond anything outside! You don't want that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finn laughed, a harsh, mocking sound. "Of course we want it, but we have to live to enjoy it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can't climb the ladder of power if we're dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So let's move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, over ninety percent of the thousand-strong warriors from Eidolon City followed Finn's lead and left, leaving behind a mere thirty or so, primarily warriors from the Carey family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confusion flickered in their eyes as they exchanged worried glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What now? Everyone's gone&mdash;we can't hold this position!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Should we leave too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dave bit his lip, torn between choices, a storm of conflict echoing in his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Leave? Abandon the Carey family's heritage?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abandon the million ordinary folks in Eidolon City to hide in another city?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, as if a spark ignited, Cillian seized the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad! We don't have to go! I told you, we've already secured reinforcement! Godfather himself is coming to help us! With Godfather here, the danger will soon be under control!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dave turned to Cillian, anger flashing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cillian! What is wrong with you? This is no time for jokes! When will you ever grow up? How can I ever trust you with the leadership of the Carey family if you keep this up?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is this 'Godfather'? And how could he possibly come to our aid?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop with these ridiculous jokes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cillian was on the verge of tears; his father simply wouldn't believe him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia and Zoe couldn't hold back their laughter, their eyes twinkling with mischief as they looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, it seems no one believes your identity. But seriously, it's hard to connect your looks with the title 'Godfather,'" Anastasia teased with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe nodded. "Osborne looks terrifying in battle. But at other times, he's just... you know, strikingly handsome. He doesn't exactly fit the 'Godfather' image!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a bit exasperated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The truth was, after becoming the Godfather, he should have held a coronation ceremony, inviting all the Ancient Families and superpowers of Rosmandi to attend, making sure everyone knew what the new Godfather looked like.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But during that period, the Augustine family was in turmoil, and Osborne was busy </span><span>breaking through to Class S, enhancing his strength. Thus, his inauguration ceremony never took place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, apart from a few insiders who knew his identity and appearance, most people had no clue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dave, being the head of a wealthy family, didn't recognize Osborne. It was only natural for him not to believe that this young, handsome man could be the Godfather.</span></p></div>
