        <h1>Chapter 901 The Light Realm</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the crowd beneath the arena could no longer see Osborne. He was completely engulfed by Marlon's overwhelming attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each solar sword sliced through the air, brimming with terrifying power. Even the lower-ranked Godsons on the Godson Rankings were in shock. They even thought that they might fail to withstand a single solar sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne might very well be killed under such an overwhelming barrage, they thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family was very worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had always known Marlon was powerful, but this was beyond their expectations. This level of strength could easily take down an ordinary Class S Supreme Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marlon was a true prodigy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smugly, Marlon peered down in Osborne's direction with a smirk. Merged with the solar orb above, he looked as if he was a haughty deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can challenge me?</span><span>&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not even in the running!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as he spoke, Marlon's expression suddenly changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back on the arena, something happened. A shining radiance erupted from Osborne's position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The light kept being stronger, building up until it exploded with a thunderous sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, every solar sword shattered, replaced by a dazzling hemispherical light that puffed and engulfed the entire arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Light Realm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The powerful Light Realm came out and instantly enveloped Marlon's Solar Realm, causing it to quake violently with cracks. Even the nine suspended solar orbs trembled as if they were on the verge of breaking down.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is happening?" Marlon was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His summoned huge mental strength to stabilize the Solar Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Marlon turned his astonished gaze back to the floor. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There, Osborne's figure slowly appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fierce attack from the solar swords was fierce enough to break his strong defense. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he looked slightly battered, with blood on the corner of his mouth from the heavy attack, his eyes remained sharp and icy, fixed on Marlon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marlon, I have to hand it to you</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>you've pushed me to my limits! This was supposed to be my trump card for someone else, but it looks like you get to enjoy it instead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then the Light Realm around Osborne flickered, pulsing with almost life-like energy. It surged forward, launching an all-out assault on Marlon's Solar Realm, forcing it to crumble piece by piece.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s impossible!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marlon exclaimed, staring at Osborne in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the overwhelming pressure from Osborne's Light Realm, he murmured,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Level Four Light Realm? This can't be real!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His astonishment was shared by the audience. Gasps echoed around the arena as they absorbed the shocking revelation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Class S Supreme Overlords on the elevated stands rose up suddenly and stared wide-eyed at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Level Four Realm? "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is that possible?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only a handful of us Class S Supreme Overlords can have a Level Four Realm! He's just a Class AAA! How does him make it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is unbelievable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Marlon with a calm smile. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing is impossible! Just because you can't do it doesn't mean others can't. Now, you</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>ll be defeated!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne unleashed his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Disintegration Rays!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beams of light with destructive force erupted from Osborne, shooting in all directions, dissolving everything they touched instantly, including Marlon's Solar Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marlon was no slouch at mastering Solar Realm; it had reached Level Three for quite some time, making him one of the most formidable candidates among the younger generation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, before Osborne's Disintegration Rays, his once-mighty Solar Realm now seemed painfully fragile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chi-Chi-Chi!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marlon</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s Solar Realm began to unravel, the nine solar orbs hovering above him fading slowly into air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel himself being pushed away from the orbs, unable to merge with their power any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time he started to panic as he realized the dire situation he was in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marlon shouted, his voice filled with desperate anger, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am Marlon! The heir of the Thornberry family! Helios, the world's strongest, is my great-grandfather! I will not be defeated by someone of my own generation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am the strongest of the young! I refuse to lose!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Solar Descent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce roar, Marlon summoned every ounce of his strength. The nine fading solar orbs instantly regained their stability, burning brighter than ever under his command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fueled by his power, they transformed into fire balls, hurtling toward Osborne with deadly speed like nine meteors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Marlon's last-ditch effort, a desperate strike that he believed would turn the tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he couldn't land a crushing blow on Osborne, he knew he would be left in a hopeless position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marlon was extremely confident about this attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, go to hell!" Marlon bellowed.</span></p></div>
