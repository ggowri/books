        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce waved his hand. "Nothing. My sister is Kendra. It seems that she is with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "She is indeed with me. She met pirates and was imprisoned by them. I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne simply recounted the incident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he talked, Bryce's expression became weird. After Osborne finished speaking, he touched his chin and said, "Since she wants to stay with you and play for a while, I won't bother her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you have to take good care of Kendra."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned. "Mr. Clarkson, aren't you going to take her back? I'm still too weak to protect her well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce smiled, "No need. It's rare for her to go outside. Let her have some fun. Don't tell her that you have seen me. She probably wants to avoid me. If she knows that you have seen me, she will probably run away to other places, and I will be even more worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your strength is indeed a little weak, but you don't have to underestimate yourself. At your age, your achievement is very impressive. You're only slightly worse than the most talented people. However, you are the one that the person has chosen. I believe that as long as you don't die, your future will be promising.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In fact, you may catch up with me soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce patted Osborne on the shoulder and said, "Work hard, and don't let that person down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Bryce prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne opened his mouth and wanted to ask Bryce if the person he was talking about was Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, he held back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Bryce didn't directly say her name, it meant he didn't want to tell him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, answers weren't necessary in some cases.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The answer was already in Osborne's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Clarkson. Don't worry, I will take good care of Kendra like my own sister."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce smiled and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he left, Serena suddenly coughed, and blood flowed from the corner of her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly held her in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Hernandez, are you okay? It's all my fault. If I hadn't proposed holding the Maritime Auction, you wouldn't have been injured."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena smiled, "Don't worry. I'm just slightly injured. I want to thank you for your ancient magic weapon. If it hadn't helped me block Chris' third attack, I would have been seriously injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I'm giving it back to you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a pity that it became more damaged because it blocked the attack for me. I owe you a favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for the Maritime Auction, it's not your fault. I was so arrogant that I thought I could strike a blow against the Aberrants, but I didn't expect them to send out so many elites."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena returned the Bronze Mirror to Osborne and coughed up blood again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Serena's mental state improved a lot after coughing up the blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Aberrants suffered a great loss with several Class A masters being killed. Now that Bryce is here, they won't dare to take action again. There will be no more accidents at the auction, so you can rest assured."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne became curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Hernandez, is the Supreme Overlord a level?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena smiled, "I knew you would ask about it. You are already a Class A martial master now, and you should know this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She waved her hand, motioning Osborne to sit down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne helped her sit down, looking at her with curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena said, "Supreme Overlord can be said to be a level or a title. It's a title for people who reach the top of human power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Each Supreme Overlord possesses the power comparable to that of a god. Their existence determines the peace of a large area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Supreme Overlord is Class S."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was surprised. "The Supreme Overlord is Class S? I remember that above Class A is Class S, right? But I feel that you are already several levels stronger than a Class A like me. Aren't you Class S?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I'm not Class S. I'm still far from it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena sighed and said, "You have such a misunderstanding because you don't know about Class A. There are several small levels between Class A and Class S. The Class A you know is just the beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For example, you just broke through and are Class A.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have been at Class A for decades. I am much stronger than ordinary Class A people like you. So I am Class AA. Bruce and Chris are both Class AA."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Class AA?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne never thought that there was a Class AA between Class A and Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't interrupt Serena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena continued, "There is actually a small level between Class A and Class AA, which is Class A+. However, the gap between Class A and Class A+ is not that huge, so I usually don't bother to mention it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And above Class AA is Class AAA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Class AAA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bryce's real level is Class AAA, but his strength is the strongest among this level. In addition, he has an ancient artifact Poseidon's trident. Poseidon's trident can unleash terrifying power at sea, so he can even unleash the strength of Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even Godfather and the King of Aberrants won't fight him at sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Bryce can also be called the Supreme Overlord."</span></p></div>
