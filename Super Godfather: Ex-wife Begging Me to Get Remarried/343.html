        <h1>Chapter 343 Reversal</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The huge sphere was still floating on the sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle used his powers to freeze the sphere from time to time, making it stronger and preventing Osborne from escaping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next to him was Eric.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was seriously injured. Osborne attacked him with two knees, which broke his jaw and seriously injured his chest. Even though Eric was a Class A- martial artist with robust vitality, it would take a long time for him to recover from such a severe injury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That bastard!" Eric couldn't help but curse. "Kyle, who is that brat? What is his power? It's a bit weird."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Kyle frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also felt that Osborne's power was a bit strange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the very beginning, he thought Osborne had the mind control power so he could resist his ice blades. But then, a layer of blue light enveloped Osborne's body, which was terribly powerful and had an abnormal defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, Osborne's body showed its stunningly strong side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could actually endure three Class A- martial artists' attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he even transformed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the transformation, Osborne injured three Class A- martial artists and almost killed Eric.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His strength was really scary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle said, "Osborne is simply almighty. He has so much strange power. Fortunately, we trapped him. Otherwise, if he continues to improve his strength, he will definitely become a serious threat to us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric nodded. "The Augustine family actually has such a talent. Fortunately, we took action early, or it would be difficult to deal with the Augustine family when he became stronger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right." Kyle thought so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric said, "Leon and Daly have already started the fight. Jacob and Layla are no match for them. They will kill everyone and come back soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle sneered, "This time, the Augustine family lost their heir, two elders, and the last ship. They will have no chance to stage a comeback."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric nodded. "The Augustine family is finished."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two chatted while sensing the battle fluctuations in the distance. They did not notice that Osborne, who was trapped in the huge sphere, was changing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless metal elements and solid ice trapped him. No matter how hard Osborne struggled, he could not break free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the two Class A- metahumans exerted their full strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne tried several times, but seeing that there was no way to break free by force, he simply stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "The metal elemental can be used in this way. It wraps around my body and then solidifies into steel, limiting my activities. After that, it bound me layer by layer, creating a huge steel sphere in a short time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I were outside the sphere, it wouldn't be hard to break it. Unfortunately, I'm trapped inside, which makes it difficult to exert force and escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ice is not threatening at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was not in a panic. It was easy for him to escape. After all, those people didn't know that he had spatial power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could use the spatial power to open a dimensional rift. Then, he could easily leave this steel sphere by interdimensional travel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne was not in a hurry to escape. He activated the X-ray vision of Satan's Eye and checked the situation outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were five Class A- metahumans outside. Even if he escaped, it was almost impossible to kill the five of them under their siege.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had almost killed one of them before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The enemies were on guard, making it more difficult for Osborne to take action successfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was waiting for a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he got it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The five people thought Osborne had been trapped, so they only left two of them to control him. The other three left and went to attack those people on the Alisa Ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew that it was his chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the three people went far, Osborne took action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dimensional rift appeared in front of him. The metal sphere was solid, but it could not prevent the formation of the dimensional rift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered and walked into the dimensional rift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, he went outside and appeared behind the two people who were guarding him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two were staring into the distance, feeling the fluctuations of the battle over there. They never expected that Osborne could escape from the metal sphere, let alone that Osborne would appear behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time they sensed that something was wrong, Osborne had started attacking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric was already seriously injured. He suddenly felt a chill in his body. He turned his head quickly but only saw Osborne's fist approaching him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, it punched him hard on the head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Eric was a Class A- martial artist, under this defenseless attack, his head exploded. He died in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne did not stop and kicked Kyle hard in the chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle reacted quickly and condensed countless ice shields on his chest, dissolving most of Osborne's strength. But even so, he still vomited blood and flew backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Eric, whose head was broken, in disbelief, with fear in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kyle widened his eyes in shock. "You... actually killed Eric!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did you escape?"</span></p></div>
