        <h1>Chapter 1156 Believe It Now?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't shake off the feeling of being misunderstood; it was becoming quite a nuisance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pondered whether he should hold a formal succession ceremony or perhaps send out his photo to all the wealthy families and Ancient Families in Rosmandi to avoid any mix-ups in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was just a passing thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, being misidentified didn't really hurt him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, it made it easier to see people's true colors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For example, if the wealthy families and Ancient Families of Eidolon City knew he was the Godfather, they wouldn't even think about leaving. They certainly wouldn't be talking about fleeing Eidolon City while disregarding the lives of its million ordinary citizens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This way, Osborne could discern which factions were selfish and which had a sense of responsibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The selfish ones needed to be kept in check, while the responsible ones deserved support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that he was the Godfather of Rosmandi, Osborne had the power to make that happen. With just a word, he could cause all the factions in Eidolon City, except for the Carey family, to plummet into decline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast, he could elevate the Carey family to new heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, seeing Cillian on the verge of tears from Dave's scolding, Osborne decided it was time to step in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you're the head of the Carey family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dave turned to Osborne, his eyes wide with surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he didn't believe that Osborne was truly the Godfather, he was grateful for the help. Dave had been scolding Cillian quietly, but Osborne's keen ears had picked up everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm Dave Carey, the head of the Carey family. May I ask how to address you?" Dave said, trying to sound respectful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "Didn't your son just tell you? I'm Osborne Augustine. What's the matter? Do you seem a bit skeptical?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dave forced a smile. "Ah, so it's you, Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't realize you shared a name with the new Godfather of Rosmandi. That's quite the coincidence! I wasn't doubting you; I was just surprised. Regardless, thank you for stepping in to help us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow with a smirk. "Why do you think I'm just sharing a name with the new Godfather? Am I not allowed to be him? Or have you met the Godfather </span><span>of Rosmandi, and you know he looks different from me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dave's face turned a shade of crimson, caught off guard by the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shot a glare at Cillian, clearly doubting, but he didn't want to offend Osborne, so he held his tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't want to waste any more time with Dave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was about to reveal his true identity when suddenly, a piercing scream echoed from the rift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a dozen Class S Dark Exotic Beasts erupted from the fissure, their menacing forms cutting through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dave exclaimed, his face draining of color, "What the hell? How is this possible? It's only been a short while!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are there so many Class S Dark Exotic Beasts? Is there really a nest down there?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Retreat! Everyone, pull back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Members of the Carey family, evacuate immediately! We can't hold them off! Get back to Eidolon City and set up a defense! The Carey family has thrived in Eidolon City, and now, in its most perilous hour, we must stand firm until the very end!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as there's hope, the Carey family will never abandon Eidolon City!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dave shouted, rallying his remaining thirty or so warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their expressions were grim as they prepared to retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dave turned to Osborne, his voice urgent. "Osborne, let's make a hasty retreat! With all the wealthy and Ancient Families of Eidolon City pulling out, we simply can't hold our ground! The only option now is to fall back to Eidolon City!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Dave was about to make a move, but Osborne calmly waved a hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need to rush. Just a bunch of Class S beasts, nothing more. Since I'm here, I'll handle them in a jiffy," Osborne said nonchalantly, then flew towards the pack of Class S Dark Exotic Beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dave was horrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, don't be reckless! Those are Class S Dark Exotic Beasts! A thousand of us from Eidolon City couldn't take them down. They..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Dave's words trailed off, his eyes widening in disbelief as his body trembled violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had suddenly teleported into the midst of the beasts. The Dark Exotic Beasts unleashed their attacks, but Osborne merely flicked his wrist. A series of thunderous bangs echoed, and the dozen Class S beasts exploded into a bloody mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, as if he had just done something trivial, reappeared before Dave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dave was left speechless, his face a mix of shock and terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you..." he stammered, unable to form a coherent sentence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a casual smile. "Mr. Dave Carey, do you believe me now? I am indeed the new Godfather of Rosmandi."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Dave shuddered and almost collapsed, but Cillian quickly helped him steady himself.</span></p></div>
