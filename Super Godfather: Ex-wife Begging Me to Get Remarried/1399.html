        <h1>Chapter 1398 Restoring the Intermediate Deity Status</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hidden in the shadows, Osborne watched as Amelia bounced around, her joy radiating like sunlight. Seeing the siblings so happy brought a smile to his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt a deep sense of gratitude towards Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only had she saved him, but she also offered him shelter, even agreeing to turn in triple the amount of Essence Crystals each month just to help him conceal his identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took note of all this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a man who believed in repaying both kindness and enmity. For the kind-hearted siblings, he was determined to find a way to repay their generosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching their exuberance, Osborne felt reassured that he had made the right decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, to him, these Essence Crystals were trivial; their true value lay in bringing happiness to Amelia and Harry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But this is just the beginning! You saved my life, and no mere Essence Crystals can repay that debt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will change your destinies, give you a bright future, and ensure you'll never again suffer under the oppression of the Dark Deity Legion. No one will ever bully you again!" he whispered to himself before slipping away into the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Osborne returned to the stone hut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, Harry and Amelia came back, their faces glowing with barely contained excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, they had struck gold, but they didn't mention anything to Osborne. Their willingness to help him didn't mean they fully trusted him yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The discovery of a high-grade vein was not something they could share lightly; if word got out, it could spell disaster, especially since this vein also produced mid-grade Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The siblings were kind, but they weren't na&iuml;ve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They kept their lips sealed about their find, but their beaming smiles spoke volumes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not the best acting there, guys. At this rate, someone's going to catch on," Osborne muttered to himself, feeling a mix of concern and hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only pray that nothing went awry; otherwise, his good intentions might backfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The following days unfolded smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia were up at dawn and back late, spending most of their time in the mine, digging out the Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each day, they returned with bright smiles, their haul substantial. In their spare time, they trained diligently, and in just a few days, both had significantly improved their skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, too, was busy with his own plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Harry and Amelia left each day, he would venture deeper into the mine, searching for the Superior Deity </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>. Once he found one, he would eliminate it, allowing the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to absorb the high-grade death scent and accelerate his recovery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, even in the depths of the mine, high-grade </span><span>Deathborns</span><span> were few and far between.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scarcity slowed Osborne's recovery more than he had anticipated, but he remained on track.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If things continued this way, he would need just a few more days to reignite the second Divine Flame and regain his Intermediate Deity strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Almost there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once I restore my Intermediate Deity status, I might finally be able to leave the mine and venture into the wild! With my current strength, it's too risky out there, but the wild has far more </span><span>Deathborns</span><span>, which means the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity can recover faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once I reach the Intermediate Deity realm, as long as I avoid </span><span>Deathborns</span><span> above the Transcendent Deity level, I won't have to fear anything. I just need to be careful, and I can survive out there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, Osborne left the stone hut once more, determination driving him forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a dozen hours, Osborne was the first to return to the stone hut, his face beaming with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, Lady Luck seemed to be on his side. He had encountered not one but two Superior Deity </span><span>Deathborns</span><span> and six Intermediate Deity </span><span>Deathborns</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Consequently, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity had recovered even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's second Divine Flame had finally reignited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had finally regained his Intermediate Deity status! Achieving Intermediate Deity level meant Osborne could at last hold his ground in </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, even if it was just barely. He could now escape a losing battle and survive in the wilderness if he had to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No more incessant tiptoeing around!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this newfound confidence, Osborne decided that come tomorrow, he would bid farewell to Harry and Amelia, planning to venture into the wilds alone. His goal was to quickly restore his Superior Deity level and rejuvenate the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian, Anastasia, and the others, including Bryce and Divine Shadow, were still trapped within the Dimensional Microcosm. Presently, the Dimensional Microcosm was entirely enveloped by the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity's petals, leaving Osborne unable to enter or contact them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only when the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity recovered further, allowing its petals to bloom, would Osborne be able to reopen the Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope they are doing okay," Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Harry and Amelia returned, their faces radiant. Over the past few days, they had managed to mine over 10 thousand low-grade Essence Crystals and over a hundred mid-grade Essence Crystals from the high-grade mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This haul was more than what they usually gather in a year!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after handing over triple the Essence Crystals as required, they still had plenty left. With the pressure off their shoulders, their joy was impossible to contain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold it right there!"</span></p></div>
