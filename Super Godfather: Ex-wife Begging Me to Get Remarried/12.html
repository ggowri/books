        <h1>Chapter 12 X-Ray Vision</h1>
        <div><p>Osborne, visibly embarrassed, quickly took the wristlet but was stunned again.</p><p>The watch looked ordinary, though the dial was delicately designed with a majestic flying dragon surrounded by ten stars.</p><p>Of these stars, nine were dim, with only one shining brightly.</p><p>“This is my reward?”</p><p>Osborne couldn’t believe it. Even if the wristlet were made of solid gold and studded with diamonds, it would only be worth a few hundred thousand dollars at most.</p><p>The Godfather, his grandfather, had sent him into the dangerous clutches of the Caldwell Manor for the first test of inheritance, and all he got in return was a watch.</p><p>This seemed rather stingy.</p><p>“I’d rather have you, the Night Witch, as my reward.”</p><p>Osborne didn’t hide his dissatisfaction.</p><p>Isa chuckled, clearly pleased, “You’ve got a good taste now, realizing my worth? Too bad, it’s too late for regrets.”</p><p>Osborne stayed silent, looking glum.</p><p>Isa, however, explained seriously, “This is the Draco Star Wristlet, also known as the Power Bracelet. Only those who are the Godfather’s absolute confidants possess it. Normally, a Draco Star Wristlet has only seven stars, but yours is special with ten stars. The more stars that are lit, the greater your authority. You will become the new Godfather when you light up all ten stars.”</p><p>Osborne asked, “What can I do with it?”</p><p>“It’s significant. It’s a symbol of identity. With it on, you can go to any enterprise under the Draco Group, and you’ll be treated as a VIP. As your authority increases, you can even use it to mobilize various resources of the Draco Group, including its power, cash, and networks.”</p><p>Osborne’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Moreover, the Draco Star Wristlet is manufactured using the most advanced technology of the Draco Group. It cannot be replicated by others, and only its owner can activate its internal storage space. That’s where your real reward is.”</p><p>Osborne was even more surprised and quickly tried to activate it.</p><p>Soon, using his fingerprint and iris, he activated the Draco Star Wristlet’s storage space.</p><p>The real reward finally appeared.</p><p>Then, Osborne’s eyes widened.</p><p>“Draco Star Wristlet, ID 9002, registered to Osborne, one-star authority. With this bracelet, you may freely enter any non-confidential location of the Draco Group, enjoy VIP status, receive a 10% discount on purchases, cash balance…”</p><p>“One hundred million dollars? There’s actually one hundred million dollars?” Osborne exclaimed, double-checking to ensure there were eight zeros before clenching his fists tightly.</p><p>A hundred million dollars…</p><p>This was the first time Osborne had seen so much money in his life.</p><p>He felt dazed, overwhelmed by the surreal feeling.</p><p>“Calm down.” Isa looked disdainful. “You are the Godfather’s designated heir. His entire inheritance will be yours one day. This hundred million dollars is nothing to him, not even a drop in the bucket.”</p><p>Hearing this, Osborne quickly calmed himself.</p><p>Isa continued, “Don’t just focus on the money. The real value in the Godfather’s gift isn’t just cash. Check out those files. Their worth far exceeds a hundred million dollars.”</p><p>Intrigued, Osborne quickly looked at the encrypted folder within the Draco Star Wristlet.</p><p>Upon opening the encrypted folder, he found two subfolders.</p><p>The first was named Satan’s Eye.</p><p>The second was named The Breath of Celestial.</p><p>Osborne opened the folder for Satan’s Eye and quickly scanned through it before freezing in place.</p><p>Inside the folder was an introduction to Satan’s Eye and methods to enhance its level.</p><p>As a unique ability stemming from the Augustine family bloodline, Satan’s Eye could be upgraded through ten levels. With each upgrade, another white star spot would appear in the pupil.</p><p>The more white star spots there were, the more powerful Satan’s Eye became.</p><p>“White star spots?”</p><p>Osborne frowned slightly. His Satan’s Eye was only at level one, indeed showing only one-star spot, but the star spot in his eyes seemed silver, not white.</p><p>“Perhaps it is described differently?”</p><p>Osborne didn’t dwell on it. At level one, Satan’s Eye only enhanced vision, night vision, and slowing ability.</p><p>As the level of Satan’s Eye increased, its formidable abilities would gradually reveal.</p><p>X-ray vision.</p><p>Manipulating matter.</p><p>Shooting magic light.</p><p>Projecting illusions.</p><p>Stopping time.</p><p>Controlling memories.</p><p>And so on…</p><p>All sorts of terrifying abilities would appear as the level of Satan’s Eye increased.</p><p>“Using the Draco Group’s Alpha Elixir, Satan’s Eye can be upgraded to level two. Level two Satan’s Eye can make me see through anything?”</p><p>Osborne became visibly excited.</p><p>X-ray vision!</p><p>What man could resist that?</p><p>He quickly asked, “So, where can I buy the Alpha Elixir, Night Witch?”</p></div>
