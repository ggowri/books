        <h1>Chapter 1402 Shock</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the group of Intermediate Deities charged at Osborne, Harry and Amelia turned pale, fear etched across their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne merely smiled faintly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Good thing I've been putting in the work lately, regaining my strength. I'm back at the Intermediate Deity level. Otherwise, facing a situation like this would be quite a headache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now? It's simple: I'll just kill you all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The difference in their abilities was stark. Osborne demonstrated to everyone present that even at the same Intermediate Deity level, they couldn't withstand a single blow from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't even break a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne weaved through the crowd, striking casually, each movement effortlessly claiming the life of an Intermediate Deity as if he were swatting flies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, it felt less like fighting fellow Intermediate Deities and more like dealing with a bunch of helpless infants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back on Blue Planet, Osborne had been able to take down Transcendent Deities, and even when besieged by Superior Deities, he could slice through them one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Intermediate Deities hadn't stood a chance against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, although Osborne's realm had returned to that of an Intermediate Deity, his space elemental essence hadn't fully recovered, meaning he wasn't at his peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, taking out a few Intermediate Deities was still a walk in the park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In mere moments, the tide turned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than half of the group attacking Osborne lay dead, and the remaining few were paralyzed with fear, desperate to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's cold laughter echoed in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can run after attacking me? You're better off dying here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he accelerated, his strikes becoming swifter and more powerful, effortlessly reaping lives. These Intermediate Deities, once warriors who commanded respect in their villages and had basked in the favor of Patrick, now found themselves regretting not having a couple more legs to run faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Patrick, help me!" one cried out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! I was wrong! Spare me; I see my mistake now!" another begged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't kill me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their screams fell on deaf ears as Osborne continued his relentless slaughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick, stunned, watched as his once-loyal followers dwindled to just three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fury surged within him, twisting his features into a mask of rage. "Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce shout, Patrick unleashed a powerful palm strike toward Osborne, the overwhelming divine power of a Superior Deity erupting around him, attempting to envelop Osborne's form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled. "A Superior Deity, huh? Now that's somewhat interesting. At least it won't feel like a total cakewalk!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a surge of his own divine power, Osborne shattered Patrick's attack effortlessly. He then swung the Goddess of Grain's scythe, dispatching the last three Intermediate Deities with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the area fell eerily silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground was littered with corpses, a gruesome sight that sent chills down the spines of those still standing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Patrick, his wife, and the two Intermediate Deities holding Harry and Amelia remained, all of them frozen in shock as they stared at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had taken down a group of Intermediate Deities without breaking a sweat! Even Patrick's desperate attempt to intervene had been futile; he could only watch as Osborne effortlessly eliminated his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A collective gasp filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Harry and Amelia were left speechless, their faces drained of color, utterly stunned by the display of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such strength was staggering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick, a Superior Deity, couldn't possibly kill a dozen Intermediate Deities with such ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Patrick realized the truth: Osborne was stronger than he had ever imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face darkened, a storm brewing within him. With a roar, he demanded, "Who the hell are you?! You dare to kill so many of my men&mdash;you're looking for a death sentence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a casual shrug. "Does it really matter who I am? I already told you, let Harry and Amelia go, and let me take them away. Otherwise, you'll regret it. Now, do you regret it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick clenched his fists, his face darkening. He indeed regretted it. If only he had known Osborne's true strength, he would've acted sooner, coordinating with his men to swiftly eliminate him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can we go now?" Osborne grinned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick ground his teeth, his voice dripping with venom. "Go? Where do you think you're going?! This is within the Ninth Dark Deity Legion's jurisdiction. I don't care who you are or how strong you think you are&mdash;you've killed so many of my men, there's no escape for you! I advise you to surrender immediately, or the world, vast as it is, will have no place for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's voice turned icy. "You won't let me go? Is that a challenge to kill you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick burst into </span><span>laughter,</span><span> his face twisted with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill me? Just because you've got a bit of power doesn't mean you can take me on. And do you really dare? I'm a reserve member of the Ninth Dark Deity Legion! Killing me is akin to declaring war on the legion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their million-strong army&mdash;think you can stand against that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finished with a mocking grin. "I'm right here. Go ahead, take a shot."</span></p></div>
