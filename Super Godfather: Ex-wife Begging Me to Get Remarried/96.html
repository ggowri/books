        <h1>Chapter 96 Facing the Thunderbolt</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this moment, everyone watched that terrifying thunderbolt splitting down towards Osborne with incomparable worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Auntie, save him!&rdquo; Clarissa, pale and clutching Donna&rsquo;s arm, yelled anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna looked grave. She immediately wanted to make a move. But then she hesitated when she thought of Osborne&rsquo;s words telling her not to strike for a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that moment, the thunderbolt had swiftly struck Osborne&rsquo;s head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Boom!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In an instant, Osborne was enveloped by the thunderbolt. Everyone couldn&rsquo;t help but close their eyes, thinking that Osborne would be turned into a charred corpse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But the next second, there were cries of surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on? The thunderbolt is avoiding his body.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Look!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Everyone looked at Osborne and was instantly very shocked. The thunderbolt had disappeared. The land around Osborne was scorched black by it, but he was still standing there steadily, smiling calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;How could it be?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Raymond frowned tightly, looking at Osborne incredulously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, he saw the bulletproof armor Osborne was wearing and was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Class B Defensive Soft Armor from the Draco Group?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Damn! How could you possibly have it?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Raymond roared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne smiled, &ldquo;I knew you would come to attack Ms. Radcliffe. How could I not prepare? You can manipulate the thunderbolt, and you are indeed very powerful. Unfortunately, you can&rsquo;t strike me. What&rsquo;s the use of that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;This Class B Defensive Soft Armor was given to me by someone else. It&rsquo;s said to be able to defend against five full-force attacks from a metahuman below Class B with a single charge. It looks like it&rsquo;s really effective.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was happy at this point.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This Class B Defensive Soft Armor had cost him fifty million dollars. It was not only more robust than normal bulletproof armor, but it was also able to defend against all kinds of supernatural attacks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It cost a million dollars for a single recharge and could withstand five attacks by a metahuman under Class B.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Raymond&rsquo;s rank was Class C+, less than Class B. So even with his full attack, he couldn&rsquo;t penetrate Osborne&rsquo;s Class B Defensive Soft Armor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne thought, <span style="font-style: italic;">It&rsquo;s </span><span style="font-style: italic;">really worth</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> fifty million dollars</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Raymond&rsquo;s expression was incredibly grim at the moment. He stared at Osborne intensely, even wanting to eat him up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Such an unexpected situation disrupted their plans.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Raymond wasn&rsquo;t worried and sneered, &ldquo;So what if you have Class B Defensive Soft Armor? It can only withstand five attacks. After that, you are a mole in my eyes. You&rsquo;ll die as I want you to.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne said calmly, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. But I&rsquo;m not fighting alone. Ms. Donna will be showing up soon to attack you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that, Raymond burst out laughing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He said contemptuously, &ldquo;Donna? How dare that old woman show up? If I&rsquo;m not wrong, she can&rsquo;t move now, right? I&rsquo;m afraid she can&rsquo;t even move her fingers, not to mention to use her powers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;When I&rsquo;m done with you, I&rsquo;ll go kill her myself.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At those words, Osborne looked odd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this moment, Donna, inside the car, looked incomparably gloomy. Hearing Raymond&rsquo;s words, she snorted coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Auntie, it looks like Osborne was right. Paul really is a spy! The candy he gave us was really poisoned.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This time, Donna didn&rsquo;t retort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She knew now, even if she was stupid, that Paul had a problem. Only she couldn&rsquo;t figure out how Paul did it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna thought, <span style="font-style: italic;">Why didn&rsquo;t Clarissa&rsquo;s ability to recognize lies work on Paul?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Go to hell.&rdquo; Raymond didn&rsquo;t continue to waste time, immediately controlling the thunderbolt and blasting it at Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was a little envious at this point.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His ability, Satan&rsquo;s Eye, was powerful, but it was ultimately unable to attack directly. Compared to Raymond&rsquo;s ability to control thunderbolts like a celestial god, Satan&rsquo;s Eye was too inconspicuous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Satan&rsquo;s Eye can shoot magic light when it reaches level four. By then, it should be more powerful, right?&rdquo; Thinking, Osborne still didn&rsquo;t dodge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He couldn&rsquo;t dodge it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The thunderbolt&rsquo;s attack was fast, and even with Satan&rsquo;s Eye slowing it down, he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to dodge it with his current physical fitness. If he didn&rsquo;t have Class B Defensive Soft Armor, he would have to use his body to resist it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne wasn&rsquo;t sure he could carry it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After all, the time he had cultivated The Breath of Celestial was too short. His physical qualities were still in a period of rapid improvement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But instead of worrying, he shouted, &ldquo;Ms. Donna, it&rsquo;s your turn.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When he finished speaking, a cold snort rang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne then felt a majestic force instantly coalesce into an earth-colored barrier above his head, keeping all the thunderbolts out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The thunderbolt blasted onto the earth-colored barrier, which exploded, but the thunderbolt also disappeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The next second, Donna pushed open the car door and stepped out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She coldly stared at Raymond and sneered, &ldquo;Raymond, don&rsquo;t you think you can escape again today. You tried to kill my niece Clarissa several times. Just die here today.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna finished, and a yellow light appeared at her feet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her body slowly floated as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Raymond&rsquo;s expression was beyond awful at this point. He looked at Donna in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;How could you not be poisoned?&rdquo;</p></div>
