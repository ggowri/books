        <h1>Chapter 504 The Safe House</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa nodded with a smile. "I can feel it coming. I need a safe place where I won't be disturbed to make the breakthrough! Don't worry, Osborne. I can tell it's going to go smoothly. There won't be any problems."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once I've successfully broken through, I'll really be able to help you," she added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Clarissa actually broke through to Class A, she wouldn't just be able to help him. She might even be stronger than he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Clarissa possessed two divine artifacts: the Fate Staff and the Trident of Poseidon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even before reaching Class A, Clarissa could hold her own against Alexander using just the Fate Staff. Even Bruce, a Class A fighter, was wary when facing her, as if he feared something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she broke through to Class A, the Fate Staff would become even more formidable in her hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then there was the Trident of Poseidon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While its power was most potent at sea&mdash;enough to be called the greatest divine artifact of the ocean&mdash;it was still incredibly powerful even on land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce had already sent Osborne the instructions for using the Trident, and Osborne had been stunned by its capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to it, his Blood Cross, which he suspected might be a divine artifact, seemed like a cheap knockoff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Osborne's first real understanding of just how terrifying divine artifacts </span><span>could be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, once Clarissa broke through to Class A, her power would increase dramatically. Even Osborne wasn't entirely confident he could handle her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, go ahead and focus on your breakthrough," Osborne said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have a secluded villa with a high-standard safe house built underneath it. I'll take you there secretly. No one will know. You can carry out your breakthrough in the safe house, and I'll set up some alert systems. If anything happens, I'll know immediately and come right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was already thinking ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And don't worry about Autumn," he added. "She's my daughter too, and I'll take good care of her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! This breakthrough could take as little as two weeks or as long as a month. I won't be able to be with you during that time, so please take care of yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course," Osborne replied, wasting no time as he sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened a Dimensional Space and took Clarissa to an unassuming villa on the outskirts of </span><span>Pinchide</span><span> City. Beneath the villa was a high-standard safe house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This safe house had been prepared by the Augustine family as a refuge for the family heir in case of a dire threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the perfect place for Clarissa's breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one would disturb her there, and even a Class A warrior would have a hard time breaching its defenses quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Osborne planned to set up alert systems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If anyone attacked the safe house, Osborne would know immediately. With his spatial power, he could arrive swiftly via a dimensional rift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He unlocked the safe house with a password and checked the interior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was well-equipped, with all the necessary amenities, and stocked with enough food to last for a year or two if needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, Osborne, you can go now. I can feel the power building up. I need to start the breakthrough now," Clarissa said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take your time. Don't rush the process. If anything goes wrong, contact me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will," Clarissa replied, smiling as she stepped closer and kissed him on the lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne left, watching as the door to the safe house closed behind him. He took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, let it go smoothly," he murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Breaking through to Class A was no easy feat. The success rate was incredibly low&mdash;out of a hundred people who attempted it, on average, only one would succeed. Ninety would die in the process, and the remaining nine would fail but survive, ending up as Class A- warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was worried about Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though her energy was pure and she seemed confident, he couldn't help but feel anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he knew there was nothing he could do. The breakthrough was her battle, and he couldn't assist her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After calming his mind, Osborne set up the alert systems and returned to the Augustine Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He first entrusted Autumn to Yulissa, asking her to look after the child, then made his way to the meeting hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac, Brian, and the other elders had already returned and were in the hall when he arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces were lit with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne entered, everyone except Isaac, who was in a wheelchair, stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all looked at Osborne with intense respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you're just in time. We were discussing how to deal with the four ancient families. No. Wait... There's also the Paltrow family, so it's actually five ancient families," Isaac said as he moved his wheelchair aside, making room for Osborne at the head of the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment but then sat down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he was still only the heir, not yet the family head, his power and influence now exceeded everyone else's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting at the head of the table felt appropriate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced around the room before speaking calmly, "Have you reached a decision? How do you plan to deal with the five ancient families?"</span></p></div>
