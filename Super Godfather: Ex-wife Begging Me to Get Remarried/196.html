        <h1>Chapter 196 The Soft Spot</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the gunshot shattered the silence, everyone on the viewing platform quickly turned their eyes to the screens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a sniper shot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who fired that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that Chevalier Security's team finally used their invisibility to get close and start the attack?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's been hit?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd buzzed with excitement and speculation as they searched the footage for the shooter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Clarissa's face went pale with surprise when she realized the shooter was Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had found a high vantage point, steadying a massive sniper rifle. His scope was locked onto a dark spot 1500 feet away, where nothing seemed to be visible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with Skyefall Security's top-notch night-vision gear, they couldn't detect anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But through Osborne's Satan's Eye, the scene was clear. Six shadowy figures were creeping up on a few Skyefall Security's scouts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were clustered around a muscular man shrouded in swirling black mist, an invisibility effect that made them completely undetectable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were now only 300 feet away from their targets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then, Osborne fired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The A-grade sniper rifle from the Draco Group was legendary for its terrifying power. It was said to be able to punch through the toughest tank armor and was so precise that even the best marksmen could hit a coin from over six thousand feet away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At 1500 feet, this distance was no challenge for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even hitting a fly would have been a certainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the added suppressor and flash hider, the gunshot's sound was still thunderous. The powerful sniper bullet flew at incredible speed towards the burly man capable of using invisibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bullet reached him long before the sound of the shot did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Relying on his invisibility, the burly man was completely unaware that someone had locked onto his position for a precise shot, and he had no defenses prepared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he even heard the shot, his head exploded in a violent burst, his body flung backward and collapsing 15 feet away, lifeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he was a Class C+ level metahuman, a direct hit to the head left no chance for survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their leader down and their invisibility shattered, the other five figures became visible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stared in shock at their fallen comrade, clearly stunned by the turn of events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In all their past encounters, they had never faced such a threat. They had always been the ones who attacked unseen, never the ones who were hunted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they were caught off guard by an enemy who could see right through their defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Skyefall Security's team, having anticipated the threat, swiftly locked onto the positions of the five people. Seizing the moment while the enemies were still stunned and disoriented, they launched their assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fire!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go for the head! Their bodies are enhanced with mechanical upgrades and they're wearing bulletproof vests. Even if you hit them, it might not be fatal, so aim for the head!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Valentin's command, the snipers, already in position, began their deadly work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of their rifles were Class C, but the firepower was still overwhelming. No mere flesh could withstand it. Even a Class C martial artist would be doomed if struck in the head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flurry of gunfire erupted, and immediately, three of the five had their heads blown apart, falling lifelessly without a chance to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining two, finally realizing what was happening, began rolling desperately, narrowly dodging the incoming bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was no cover nearby to hide behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, never one to shoot blindly, had waited until they were in an open, exposed position before opening fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite dodging the initial barrage, the two men were still out in the open, vulnerable to the snipers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a calm reload, Osborne took aim again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a heartbeat, another bullet found its mark, and another enemy's head exploded, sending him to his end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The final foe met the same grim fate under the relentless fire of the snipers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All six attackers sent by Apollo were now dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin, seeing the success, couldn't help but celebrate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nice work!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, we've got the numbers on our side now. They're down to twenty-four, and we've still got thirty. Haha, thanks to you; otherwise, we'd be in real trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin was brimming with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, offered a calm smile and replied, "Don't get too carried away. The real battle has just begun. These six were good at ambushes and assassinations, but they weren't top-tier fighters. Taking them out will hurt Apollo, but it doesn't decide the outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The real challenge is the upcoming frontal fight. That's where it counts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin's excitement immediately dampened at the seriousness of Osborne's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's our next move? You give the orders."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne considered for a moment, then his eyes gleamed with a new idea. He motioned for Valentin to come closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My goal is to take out Apollo. Here's the plan..."</span></p></div>
