        <h1>Chapter 203 Devil's Light</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After testing the power of the water element, Osborne frowned slightly, "This is strange."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Satan's Eye could devour elemental essence, but there was a limit to it. Throughout history, many holders of Satan's Eye could only absorb two types of elemental essence, and those who could absorb three were considered rare talents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For example, Osborne's grandfather, the Godfather, only absorbed three types of elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If more were absorbed, the host would experience discomfort or even explode from the pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family's historical records mentioned that their ancestor, who absorbed the most elemental essence, was five, but he exploded during the final fusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after absorbing three types of elemental essence, Osborne felt no pressure, as if his Satan's Eye could continue to absorb indefinitely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could my Satan's Eye really be different from the one passed down in the Augustine family? For instance, the stars in their Satan's Eyes are white, while mine are silver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How many elemental essences can I absorb?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne muttered. But being able to absorb more elemental essences meant his strength and potential would be greater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling no pressure now was a good thing for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder how strong I am now? Isa said that a Class B metahuman's body would produce a soul of powers, and since I haven't produced one yet, my strength must still be below Class B."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I feel like I should be able to fight a Class B metahuman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt the immense power within him, full of confidence. After consecutively absorbing earth and water essence, he felt his strength had at least doubled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even without transforming into a Vampire with Blood Cross, he felt he could battle an average Class B metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right, elemental essences can be fused. The fused power is called Devil's Light. Devil's Light is stronger than ordinary elemental powers. Now that I have three elemental essences, can I try fusing them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at Valentin and Apollo's battle. The two were fighting fiercely, and although Valentin was at a disadvantage, he hadn't shown any signs of defeat. So, he decided to fuse the elemental essences first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt confident in dealing with Apollo but wasn't sure he could kill him, so he needed to continue enhancing his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope the Devil's Light won't disappoint me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and began to control the earth and water essences within him and fuse them together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The process went incredibly smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wisp of ocular energy from Satan's Eye merged into the two elemental essences, acting like a catalyst, allowing them to fuse together effortlessly without any energy repulsion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The earth element is thick, and the water element is gentle, complementing each other. And there's the catalytic effect of ocular energy. That's why the fusion was so easy. If I had tried to fuse them with lightning first, it might not have been so smooth, and there could have been a failure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne muttered, waiting for the two elements to fully fuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the process was completed, the two essences taking on a red form that looked like a halo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this Devil's Light?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strength of the Devil's Light could be distinguished by color. The weakest was level one Devil's Light, formed by fusing two elemental essences, and was red. Then came level-two Light, formed by three elemental essences, which was orange. Next, level three was yellow, and level four green.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for level five, no one had ever successfully fused it. An ancestor of the Augustine family once fused level four Devil's Light, but he died right after succeeding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne muttered, "Let me see how powerful level one is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne concentrated his will and opened his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A swirling red halo appeared in his palm, greedily absorbing the surrounding earth and water elements, growing stronger and containing a power that even Osborne found terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't dare linger and quickly threw the red light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The red light struck a massive ancient tree that required five people to encircle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An explosion ensued, and the tree's trunk was pierced with a hole the size of a basin. The red light continued to penetrate several trees before landing on the ground, leaving a pit several meters deep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had only wanted to test it, so he used less than 30% of his strength, yet it caused such destruction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a regular cannonball didn't have such power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne became excited. He continued to channel the elements, and the red light enveloped his body. Osborne found that the red light's defensive power was more than double that of an earth elemental armor of the same thickness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My attack and defense have greatly improved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Indeed, Devil's Light lives up to its name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just by fusing from two elemental essences, it has such power. How terrifying would the level two Devil's Light be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And what about level three? Level four, or even level five?"</span></p></div>
