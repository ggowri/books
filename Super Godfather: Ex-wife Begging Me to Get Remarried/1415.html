        <h1>Chapter 1414 Absorb Memories</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Lachlan dispatched, Osborne quickly turned to assist Albert and Laird.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them were struggling to hold off the remaining four Superior Deities, their situation growing dire. If it weren't for the narrow confines of the mine, the four would have overwhelmed them long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Albert and Laird were covered in blood, but they followed Osborne's orders without hesitation, refusing to back down even with their bodies battered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their determination bought Osborne the precious time he needed to eliminate Lachlan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with Osborne joining the fray, the tide of battle shifted dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four were merely Superior Deities, and in the face of Osborne's power, they were nothing more than stepping stones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He easily injured them, binding their movements with his divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said coldly, "Submit like Albert and Laird, and I'll place a seal on you that will allow you to live.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, death is all that awaits you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four exchanged glances, their eyes burning with defiance and rage. One woman cried out, "You lowly native human! If you dare to kill us, you won't escape unscathed! You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, Osborne swung the scythe of the Goddess of Grain, severing her head cleanly from her shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining stared in shock, their eyes wide with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We yield!" they shouted in unison, their voices trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They allowed Osborne to mark them with his seal, which was, in truth, a transformation into Blood Clan members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jaxton Wolfe of the Wild Bull Clan, at your service, my Lord."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Arlen Margery of the Rainbow Viper Clan, at your service, my Lord."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Darnell Keynes of the Crimson Ironhoof Clan, at your service, my Lord."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three bowed respectfully to Osborne, now fully converted into Blood Clan members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rise," he commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these three added to his ranks, Osborne had transformed all five into Blood Clan warriors, making them his most loyal subordinates. As long as they didn't expose their new identities, no one would suspect they had become part of the Blood Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It struck Osborne as curious that these five came from different Dark Deity races.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaxton's true form was a massive bull covered in tough scales. Arlen was a vibrant, venomous snake adorned with three sharp horns. Darnell was a striking crimson horse with a pair of enormous wings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Along with Albert from the Aether Hawks Clan and Laird from the Fero Tiger Clan, they represented five distinct Dark Deity races.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, "Lord Malevolence's followers seem to come from various races.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lachlan mentioned that Lord Malevolence commanded hundreds of clans. Though Lachlan is dead, I've captured his memories. I can absorb them now, and with that knowledge, I'll gain a clearer understanding of Celestara's dynamics."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne began to absorb the surrounding blood energy, storing it within his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Blood Demon were still trapped in the Dimensional Microcosm, and since the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity hadn't yet been restored, he couldn't contact them. For now, he would save this blood energy to enhance their strength when the time was right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Settling into a meditative position, Osborne focused entirely on absorbing Lachlan's memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lachlan was a squad leader in the Ninth Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though his rank was modest, being a native human from Celestara and rising to such a position within the Legion was no small feat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His understanding of Celestara far surpassed that of Harry and Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne absorbed Lachlan's memories, he gained a comprehensive insight into everything Lachlan knew about. The details of Lachlan's life and knowledge unfolded before him like a vivid tapestry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what felt like an eternity, Osborne suddenly snapped his eyes open, shock and gravity etched across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his astonishment, he had uncovered a wealth of information about Lord Malevolence&mdash;something he had never anticipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through Lachlan's memories, Osborne learned the origins of Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Lord Malevolence is human!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he's not a native of Celestara. He hails from the depths of the cosmos, from a world even more powerful than Celestara itself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This world is known as the World of Racial Convergence, a place where countless races coexist in unparalleled prosperity and grandeur. In that realm, humans are regarded as a weak species, looked down upon by the mightier races.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, against all odds, Lord Malevolence rose to power as a human, founding a formidable empire and becoming an emperor, commanding the respect of many races.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, his ascent provoked the ire of even stronger factions. His empire was besieged, and he suffered grave injuries while making a narrow escape from the World of Racial Convergence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his loyal warriors, he eventually found refuge in Celestara, hoping to rebuild his empire from the ground up and regain his strength before returning to reclaim his former glory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But fate had other plans. Severely wounded, he fell victim to a combined assault from the Seven Deity Kings and was sealed away for a millennium.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't until a century ago that Lord Malevolence was unexpectedly rescued by the Deathborn..."</span></p></div>
