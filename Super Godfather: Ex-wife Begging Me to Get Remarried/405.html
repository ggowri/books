        <h1>Chapter 405 The Attack Is Coming</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was the first to spot the attack with his Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression was icy. "So, someone finally couldn't resist making a move. But I wonder if they are just greedy for the jewels, or is this part of the Aberrants' plan? Their strength is lacking, except for that leader in black."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained calm and didn't rush to reclaim the jewels. The jewels were all secured in sturdy alloy cases. Even a missile hit wouldn't damage the jewels inside, and each case had a Draco Group tracker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see how this unfolds first." Osborne continued to observe with his Satan's Eye without taking action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Draco Group and the Augustine family's security personnel had already mobilized, and drones swiftly arrived over the troubled waters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pirates were still fervently attacking the special operation team when they suddenly noticed the combat drones overhead, their faces changing drastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss has already left with the jewels."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's retreat, too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dozen or so pirates immediately ceased their assault and dispersed. Some tried to flee by boat, others dove into the sea, attempting to escape underwater, and some even used their powers to run swiftly on the water's surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately for them, they underestimated the Draco Group's defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The combat drones' radars locked onto them, and energy weapons fired, unleashing a barrage of terrifying electromagnetic attacks from above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, screams echoed. In a single strike, more than half of the pirates were killed, leaving only a few who had dived into the seabed alive. But their survival was only temporary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, a dozen stingrays swam nearby. These weren't real stingrays but underwater combat drones disguised as such. The drones' eyes began to charge, readying their attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the few pirates attempting to escape underwater were struck by energy weapons. They didn't even have time to scream before their bodies were hit, and they perished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within seconds, the dozen or so pirates were wiped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the leader in black, using waves to propel his small boat, had managed to escape into the distance. Curiously, he wasn't heading away but seemed to be circling around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Numerous combat and underwater drones converged on his location, and more security personnel were closing in on speedboats. Yet, he continued circling, seemingly oblivious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is he lost?" Osborne murmured, frowning as he observed the man's face. Suddenly, his expression changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, something's off! If he had dared steal the jewels, he wouldn't have gotten disoriented so easily. He doesn't look panicked at all. He's deliberately circling, trying to draw attention and defenses to himself. Then..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face darkened. He immediately called Valentin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Valentin, maintain the outer defenses! The man stealing the jewels is likely a decoy to draw our defenses. The real attack is about to happen!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin's face turned pale. "Mr. Augustine, I... Oh no!" He exclaimed, "Mr. Augustine, the radar shows a swarm of small vessels approaching rapidly from the east! The energy readings are strong!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sighed, "So it begins!" He quickly regained his composure and ordered, "Valentin, from now on, your mission is to protect the passengers and the cruise ship. No one is to leave the ship! Forget about the jewels. Leave that to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne finally stood up. His Satan's Eye glowed brightly, piercing through the sea's surface to the distant east, where he saw a fleet of unremarkable small boats approaching rapidly. Shadows stood on those boats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The jewel thief had drawn away the combat and underwater drones, leaving this part of the sea almost defenseless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can't let them get any closer," Osborne muttered through gritted teeth. "If the Aberrants' style holds, they'll likely hijack the cruise ship and use the passengers as hostages. If that happens, we'll be at a serious disadvantage. With our defenses drawn away and unable to block them, the only option left is... I must stop them myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Determined, Osborne opened his Dimensional Space and retrieved a skinmask. He quickly donned the mask, transforming into the appearance of a middle-aged man. With that done, he opened a dimensional rift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stepped into the rift, and simultaneously, a dimensional rift appeared before the approaching fleet of small boats. Osborne emerged from it, surrounded by swirling winds that held him steadily in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The figure on the boat immediately noticed Osborne. "Kill him!" A cold voice rang out.</span></p></div>
