        <h1>Chapter 536 Branch Bloodline Competition</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Owen glared at Evelynn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What kind of stupid idea did you have? If I go to assassinate him, I'll be fine if I don't get discovered. If I'm caught, even if I'm a recognized heir, I'll be imprisoned in the dungeon!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Speaking of which, a hint of fear appeared in Owen's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You know very well the horrors of the dungeon, and I don't want to go back to that damnable place. Besides, if I get locked up in the dungeon now, I'll probably miss the actual selection of the heir.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I would have lost more than I gained."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing that, Evelynn was surprised and said, "Owen, is the heir selection coming up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"According to my estimation, the heir selection is likely to start soon. Godfather will probably announce this after his eightieth birthday banquet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Speaking of which, Owen's eyes were filled with anticipation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I will definitely obtain the top three places in this selection. Only if I become one of the top three heirs, I will have a chance to become the leader of the Augustine family in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Godfather doesn't even have a direct descendant. When he passes away, I can be his heir and get the whole the Draco Group!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen's eyes were filled with excitement and anticipation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evelynn swallowed and said, "If the heir selection begins, you will truly have no way to fight against Osborne. Owen, you should prepare well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen nodded. "I'll be well-prepared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As for Osborne, you don't have to worry too much. Even if I don't fight him personally, he won't make it. Don't forget that there are still a few days left before the Branch Bloodline Competition."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Branch Bloodline Competition? Owen, will Osborne participate in it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen nodded. "He will definitely participate in it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"After all, the two recognized heir places will come from in this Branch Bloodline Competition. The only way to participate in the final selection of the heir is to become a recognized heir.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne will definitely be in it, and he'll work hard to come out on top!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Owen, do you think he'll make it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen smiled, "Of course no! Although he's quite capable, if he wants to come out of the Branch Bloodline Competition and earn a place as a recognized heir, it will be almost impossible!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because Lance, Sam, and David won't agree, and the power of the three is not that simple. Even if I fight against them and don't show my best moves, I won't even win.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If Osborne participates in the Branch Bloodline Competition, these three will surely target him, and they may even kill him on purpose."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Speaking of which, Owen sneered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The branch bloodlines in Yalynch, Marcelin and Ransford have been very restless lately, and they seem to be secretly trying to challenge the authority of the main bloodlines.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can't believe someone is saying that Lance is powerful enough to challenge me and Emma, and that he has a chance to be ranked in the top three in the heir selection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's just ridiculous!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When he becomes a recognized heir, I'll show him just how far he is from me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying that, Owen stood up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Anyway, during this period, you don't need to target Osborne anymore, and you just need to wait in peace for the Branch Bloodline Competition to begin. I'll go cultivate first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Owen left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evelynn's eyes were filled with indifference, and Osborne's disgusting face came to her mind as she bit her lip tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nasty guy. How dare you slap me? I will beat you sooner or later! You can be arrogant for a few more days, and when the Branch Bloodline Competition starts, I'll see how you die!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying that, Evelynn also went to cultivate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the Mount Seven of the Augustine family, the atmosphere became lively for a while because of the arrival of the branch bloodlines from Dampston, and it suddenly became quiet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All nine branch bloodlines from the Augustine family seemed to be cultivating diligently to improve their power.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They seemed to be waiting for something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne ended his cultivation for the day. While he was eating, he finally heard about the Branch Bloodline Competition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Branch Bloodline Competition?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne looked surprised. Henry seemed to talk about it, but Osborne didn't even care about it at that time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nathan, tell me exactly what this Branch Bloodline Competition is all about."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nathan nodded and quickly related what he had found out from his inquiries.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, this Branch Bloodline Competition is being held in four days, and all the branch bloodlines of the Augustine family who are not older than forty-five years old are eligible to sign up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Anyone who comes out on top of the Branch Bloodline Competition and wins the top two places will become the recognized heirs of the Augustine family. Also, they will have the chance to end up as the leader of the Augustine family!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nathan looked quite excited as he spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, you have to go to this Branch Bloodline Competition! If you stand out and become a recognized heir, you might be the leader of the Augustine family in the future!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When the time comes, no matter if they are from the main or branch bloodlines of the Augustine family, they will have to take orders from you! You will definitely be majestic."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's eyes filled with anticipation when he heard that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can I become a recognized heir by coming out of the Branch Bloodline Competition?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It looks like I'm going to participate in it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Otherwise, there's no way I'll accomplish the sixth test of the heir."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After thinking that, Osborne told Nathan, "Nathan, I truly can't miss this the Branch Bloodline Competition, so you should sign me up. Also, find a way to get information about the other branch bloodlines. I want to see who will be a threat to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nathan was extremely excited when he heard that Osborne was going to participate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, I'm going to sign you up now!"</p></div>
