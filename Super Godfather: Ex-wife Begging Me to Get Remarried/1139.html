        <h1>Chapter 1138 Anastasia and Zoe's Strength</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia, so you're skilled with Thunder Power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia nodded eagerly. "Yeah! Ever since I woke up, I felt this connection to lightning! Even Mr. Sebastian Augustine praised my control over it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled at her enthusiasm, asking, "Control? That's an understatement! Your </span><span>Thunder Power is </span><span>terrifying! How about we have a little competition?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's eyes lit up with interest. "A competition? How do we do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne explained, "Let's each unleash a lightning attack and see whose is stronger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sounds great! I'll go first!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, she raised her hand, and suddenly, the sky darkened</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fearsome bolt of purple lightning crackled </span><span>in the distance, not striking down but dancing in the air like a massive serpent under her command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your turn, Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood there, momentarily stunned. Watching Anastasia manipulate the lightning so </span><span>easily</span><span>, he realized he was already at a disadvantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The raw power of her lightning was explosive, and she could control it </span><span>without making it explode</span><span>&mdash;something Osborne knew he couldn't match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But </span><span>it was </span><span>attack</span><span> strength</span><span> they were competing for</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thunder of Judgment!" Osborne shouted, summoning a powerful bolt of lightning that shot toward the one controlled by </span><span>Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two lightning strikes collided with a deafening roar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sky lit up with a dazzling display of purple electricity, illuminating half the horizon before fading into darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the dust settled, only a faint flicker of lightning </span><span>remained&mdash;the one Anastasia had conjured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gasped, taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His strongest thunder attack, Thunder of Judgment, had been utterly shattered by Anastasia's control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> strong!" he exclaimed, genuine admiration in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia beamed at the compliment. "Osborne, you're </span><span>powerful</span><span>, too</span><span>! You almost managed to break my lightning! Just so you know, Mr. Sebastian Augustine couldn't even do that without using Godfather's scepter!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, feeling a surge of pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't even gone all out; his </span><span>used the</span><span> strength from three months ago before he fell into that deep slumber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now</span><span> </span><span>Osborne felt transformed, stronger than ever before, though he couldn't quite </span><span>know</span><span> just how much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Anastasia's prowess was impressive enough to leave him in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was definitely not weaker than Osborne had been three months ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her attack power was even a notch above his</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her defense, however, was still a bit lacking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three months ago, Osborne had been able to take down top-tier Class S warriors like Gerardo, Sin, Armstrong, and Reginald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gently ruffled Anastasia's hair, genuinely praising her, "My little Anastasia is amazing now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face lit up with pride at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Zoe stood a little way off, her expression dimming as she watched Osborne affectionately </span><span>patted</span><span> Anastasia's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flicker of envy crossed her eyes; she wished she could be as powerful as Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than that, she longed for the same closeness with Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne caught a glimpse of Zoe's longing expression from the corner of his eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was about to say something to her, a sudden noise pierced the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of wings slicing through the wind echoed ominously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flock of enormous birds surged from the depths of the jungle below, heading straight toward them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suddenly spoke up, his voice filled with anticipation, "Zoe, how about you take care of them? I want to see what you're capable of now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, Zoe's face lit up with excitement, and she nodded vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing the group of massive birds, each comparable to a Class B metahuman, Zoe softly uttered a single word, "Fall!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strange ripple passed through the air. The </span><span>gigantic birds, which had been soaring with menace, suddenly lost their ability to fly. Their wings ceased to flap, their eyes glazed over, and they seemed to freeze mid-air, as if their thoughts had been abruptly halted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then, they all began to plummet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, the birds disappeared into the dense forest below, none of them </span><span>ever getting to</span><span> fly</span><span> again</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched in astonishment. "Is this some kind of sonic attack?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe shook her head. "It's more than just sound! To be honest, I can't fully explain it myself. But when I make a sound, </span><span>my enemies pause, </span><span>and </span><span>their thoughts freezing, their senses disconnecting from the outside world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The stronger the enemy, the harder it is to affect them! For Class B enemies, a single word is enough to stop them in their tracks. If it's Class A, I'd need three words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it's Class S, I'd probably have to sing a whole song!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face flushed slightly as she finished, quickly adding, "But still, I'm not as awesome as Anastasia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, was thoroughly impressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He ruffled Zoe's hair gently, praising her, "My Zoe, you're pretty amazing too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An attack like that? Even I would have a hard time resisting it! Plus, you can hit multiple targets at once."</span></p></div>
