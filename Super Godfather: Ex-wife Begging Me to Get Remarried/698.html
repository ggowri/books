        <h1>Chapter 698 Eleven Class AAA</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, night had just fallen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The darkness began to cover, making it easier for Osborne to move forward. But to avoid being detected, Osborne chose to dive into the sea and slowly approach Dragon Scale Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dragon Scale Island was a long strip of land. The widest part was about three miles, and the length was around six miles. The area was not small, but the surrounding reefs made it rare for ships to approach. Occasionally, only a few fishermen would visit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, under the dim light, Dragon Scale Island seemed incredibly quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But amidst this silence, Osborne sensed danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few minutes later, Osborne finally landed on Dragon Scale Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hid in the darkness and activated Satan's Eye to survey the situation on Dragon Scale Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I can find where Donna and Barlyn are being held and rescue them quietly, maybe there won't be any need for a fight," Osborne thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the result was disappointing. His Satan's Eye, with its strong X-ray vision, scanned most of the island clearly. Even several dozen feet underground couldn't escape his sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he didn't find Donna, Barlyn, or any other hostages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He only found a group of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' strongmen on the west side of Dragon Scale Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After seeing them clearly, Osborne gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eleven Class AAA? They sure think highly of me and Clarissa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne </span><span>murmured,</span><span> his expression grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne saw three Tauren, three Werewolves, two Titans, and two Medusa there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides them, there was one more person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a middle-aged man, about forty years old. Osborne could sense that he was also a Class AAA expert, but he wasn't an evolved human. The other ten seemed to respect him greatly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No Vampire? It seems the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> know that I can counter them," Osborne snorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't act immediately and continued searching for where Donna and Barlyn were held. But after searching the entire island, he still couldn't find them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could they not be here? Or are they being held deeper underground?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He checked the time and knew he couldn't wait any longer. The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> had given him three hours to arrive. If he didn't make it, they would kill the hostages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The time was almost up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he didn't show up soon, there was no guarantee the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> wouldn't kill the four of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly sent a message to Clarissa, informing her of the situation and advising them not to act rashly, then he approached them on his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne approached, the middle-aged man immediately stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared in Osborne's direction and said with a faint smile, "Since you're here, show yourself. Sneaking around is pointless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne deactivated his dark power and revealed himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne asked seriously, "You could detect me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man smiled faintly. "Your dark power is too weak. This level of stealth might fool those evolved humans, but not me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne's expression grew more serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a deep breath and said coldly, "Your target is me. Now that I'm here, release the hostages immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No rush."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man smiled faintly. "They're not important. You are. If you die here, even if I release them now, they won't survive. If you can defeat me, you can take them with you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, I forgot to introduce myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man said calmly, "My name is Luca! I am the sixth disciple of the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>. Chris, who you killed, was my junior disciple."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he spoke, Osborne's face changed again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A disciple of the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was said that the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> was extremely selective with his disciples, accepting only those with the best talents and special abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For example, Chris' mental attacks had once given Osborne a hard time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luca's strength was undoubtedly formidable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not to mention, behind him were ten Class AAA evolved humans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Osborne's current strength, he could easily handle one or two Class AAA evolved humans. If the number reached five, he would have to go all out, and whether he won would depend on luck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if there were ten Class AAA evolved humans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Osborne was confident, he didn't think he could win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not to mention, there was also a disciple of the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, Luca!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Osborne couldn't back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a deep breath and said coldly, "If that's the case, let's fight! You're a disciple of the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>. If I kill you, he'll feel the pain, won't he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Luca couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered. "You want to kill me? How arrogant! Do you think I'm the same as these worthless, evolved humans?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to fight me, kill this group of trash first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Luca waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p></div>
