        <h1>Chapter 1456 Ten Million</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To become a VIP member of the slave market, you need to spend at least 50 million Essence Crystals&hellip; but I'll give you a break. You only need to spend 10 million! But tell me, do you really think you can pull that off?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana </span><span>sneered,</span><span> her eyes filled with disdain as she looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The standard for VIP status was originally set at 50 million, but Tiana doubted Osborne could muster such an amount. Even the Swift family wouldn't spend that much just to bail him out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she lowered the bar, realizing that killing Osborne wouldn't yield much profit for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Tiana really wanted was to line her pockets, and by setting the threshold at 10 million, she aimed to pressure the Swift family into coming up with that sum to save "Lachlan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten million was a calculated figure based on her assessment of the Swift family's resources and Lachlan's importance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Making a demand for too many Essence Crystals would undoubtedly lead the Swift family to abandon "Lachlan." However, demanding too few would leave her unwilling to let "Lachlan" off so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ten million Essence Crystals? Are we talking low-grade Essence Crystals here?" Osborne asked, his tone calm and steady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana couldn't help but scoff. "Not low-grade! Do you think I'm talking mid-grade? I said 10 million! Ten million mid-grade Essence Crystals&mdash;you really think you have that? The Swift family wouldn't come up with that either!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She figured Osborne was just playing dumb, but what she didn't know was that he actually had 10 million mid-grade Essence Crystals on hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied, unfazed by her attitude, "Oh, so it's just 10 million low-grade Essence Crystals. In that case, I'm relieved!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana rolled her eyes at his nonchalance. "Then hurry up and call your family to send the money! I'm giving you two hours to get that cash together. If the Swift family doesn't cough it up in that time, you can forget about any mercy from me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Like I said, if you don't spend that 10 million today and become a VIP client, you're a dead man! Not even your grandfather Walter can save you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ten million&mdash;get the Swift family to send it over, and I'll come back once the money's here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne called out, a curious look on his face, "Wait!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just 10 million low-grade Essence Crystals. Why bother having them send it? I've got it myself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Ms. Tiana Hart, could you show me around and help me spend that 10 million?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana froze, taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You mean you have ten million Essence Crystals? No need to call the Swift family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled casually, "What's the matter? Can't I have that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the calm confidence on his face, Tiana couldn't shake off a nagging doubt. "Am I really underestimating him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I'll find out soon enough if it's true!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly replaced her expression with a warm smile. "Of course! If that's the case, let's go take a look. We just got a fresh batch of goods in, and there's a top-tier slave auction happening soon. If you can spend 10 million at the auction, you'll officially be a VIP client, and I promise no one will mess with you here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She started leading the way, but Osborne raised a hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's hold off on the auction for a moment. Ms. Tiana Hart, I need you to help me deregister a few slaves and restore their normal identities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's actually the main reason I'm here. Unfortunately, your staff didn't seem to understand that and decided to give me trouble, which is why I had to teach one of them a lesson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he handed Tiana several slave contracts, each one a testament to his intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana was momentarily taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The idea of deregistering slaves and restoring their normal identities was something she had rarely encountered, even after years of working in this line of business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for her, it was just a matter of pressing a few buttons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite finding Osborne's request unusual, she didn't pry further. Tiana activated the scanner on her wrist and began to process the slave contracts he had handed over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost immediately, the contracts ignited in a flash of flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All done! Their slave registrations have been canceled, and their profiles have been wiped from the database. They're free now and can live like ordinary people again. However, there's a fee for deregistration&mdash;five thousand Essence Crystals per contract. That adds up to a total of 80 thousand Essence Crystals. Mr. Lachlan Swift, if you could settle that first?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "No problem at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached into his bag and pulled out a pouch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana took it, curiosity piqued, and opened it, her eyes widening in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mid-grade Essence Crystals?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained calm. "Is there something wrong? There are eight hundred mid-grade Essence Crystals in here, which is exactly enough to exchange for 80 thousand low-grade Essence Crystals."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana raised an eyebrow, measuring his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's true! But remember, those rates are for official exchanges. In the black market, prices tend to inflate by about twenty percent. So, eight hundred mid-grade Essence Crystals would actually get you around 96 thousand low-grade Essence Crystals!"</span></p></div>
