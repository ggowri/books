        <h1>Chapter 1077 Divine Shadow Took Action</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's face shone with surprise and excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a single glance, he recognized that Anastasia was no ordinary woman. After all, he had crafted thousands of Human Slaves himself, so he knew precisely what kind of individuals made the best candidates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never been wrong&mdash;except for that one odd case, Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even then, it wasn't really a mistake; he had simply underestimated Osborne's potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Gerardo had always held high hopes for Osborne, considering him the perfect candidate for creating a Human Slave. Otherwise, he wouldn't have wasted the best serum on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne had proven to be a raw talent beyond his wildest expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a Class AAA body boasting a strength of 9, an energy absorption rate of 99%, and an enhancement speed that reached +3 per hour at its peak, Osborne could even withstand Level 18 pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were feats Gerardo had never encountered before. Their magnitude had caught him off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, before him, the unconscious woman seemed to be even more perfectly suited for his ambitions. While she might not match Osborne's freakish capabilities, she was undoubtedly the best "material" he had seen besides Osborne&mdash;infinitely superior to Lord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a firm grip on Anastasia's shoulder, Gerardo felt her inner power surge, reacting to his presence as if it were fighting back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force emanating from her became increasingly difficult for Gerardo to withstand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He scoffed, saying, "Still trying to struggle? It's time to submit and come with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Gerardo intensified his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clash of their energies erupted, ultimately ending in Gerardo's favor. Anastasia's body was rocked by the impact, causing blood to trickle from the corner of her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe gasped in alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let her go, Anastasia!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe lunged forward, desperate to pry Gerardo's hand away, only to be met with a casual wave of his arm. A massive force sent her crashing against the wall with a dull thud, the impact reverberating through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She crumpled to the ground, blood gushing from her mouth, her insides feeling like they were in freefall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Class A or not, she stood no chance against a top-tier Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that Zoe was still alive was merely a testament to Gerardo's restraint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo chuckled. "Hmm! You two look like identical twins, but your bodies are so different. How intriguing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter, you'll come with me too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who knows, you might just surprise me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a sudden wave of energy emerged from Gerardo's hand, creating a powerful pull that yanked Zoe toward him. She felt as though her very strength was being siphoned away, leaving her utterly immobilized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair washed over her as she locked eyes with Gerardo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a mocking smile, he grasped both Anastasia and Zoe, preparing to make his exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, an ordinary-sounding cat's meow pierced the tense atmosphere. It seemed harmless enough, yet a chill gripped Gerardo's heart, flooding him with a primal fear that he couldn't shake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze shot over, and to his surprise, he noticed a pure gold cat perched on Anastasia's shoulder. Its presence was hidden behind her long hair until now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cat's eyes glimmered, fixated intently on Gerardo, sending an uncomfortable wave through his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo muttered, annoyance creeping into his voice, "What the hell?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just a cat, and it's giving me the creeps? Get lost, or I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flick of his wrist, he unleashed a surge of energy, hurling it toward the cat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Gerardo's energy struck the cat, it seemed to vanish into thin air, as if absorbed entirely by the creature. To his disbelief, the cat exhibited no signs of harm whatsoever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo froze, momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could utter another word, the cat sprang into action, launching itself toward him, claws fully extended and aimed straight for his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, an eerie surge of power radiated from the feline, stunning Gerardo beyond measure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, all thoughts of Anastasia and Zoe flew from his mind as he instinctively recoiled, but it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, three deep gashes carved themselves into his neck, nearly severing it entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell!" Gerardo gasped, panic coursing through him as he stumbled backward, making a hasty retreat outside the safe house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What just happened?" Armstrong exclaimed, eyes wide as he stared at the fresh wounds marring Gerardo's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's expression shifted to one of grim determination as he pointed toward the spot where the cat had been. "Watch out! There's something off about that creature... Wait, where did it go? It's vanished!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He blinked in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The safe house, once bustling with chaos, was now eerily silent. No sign of the cat and both Anastasia and Zoe had seemingly disappeared as if they had never existed at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This can't be happening!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's shock morphed into anger and confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he grappled with the absurdity of the situation, a familiar and powerful energy began to close in around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes widened in recognition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!" Gerardo exclaimed.</span></p></div>
