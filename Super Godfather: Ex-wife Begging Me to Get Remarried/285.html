        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boy, since you are here, I'll leave it to you. Don't worry. Just do it. I will have someone to clean up afterward."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena smiled faintly at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne bowed to her respectfully. "Ms. Hernandez, I'm sorry to bother you with this. Anyway, thank you very much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena waved her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm old. It's good to move around occasionally. I'll go then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena then left with her cane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face turned cold in an instant. He quickly glanced at Ophelia and Evelyn, then stared at Wesley with a cold sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone present was looking at Osborne in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out to be Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was actually Osborne who asked Serena to rescue Ophelia and Evelyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley looked panicked and hid behind his bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing Osborne's cold gaze, he felt a shiver. However, recalling Ophelia and Evelyn's curse that he was nothing compared to Osborne, he mustered courage and fiercely returned his glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered and walked towards Wesley step by step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the next second, Evelyn suddenly rushed over, bumped into Osborne's arms without hesitation, and hugged his waist tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned for a moment, with his hands hanging in the air, not daring to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I knew! I knew it was you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I knew you would come to save us! Osborne, I knew you wouldn't just watch me and Ophelia die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn hugged Osborne's waist and cried loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nearly died moments ago. She could face death with composure, but naturally, no one would choose death if life was an option.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially when Evelyn knew that it was Osborne who saved her, she became even </span><span>more thrilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, she rushed into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her actions stunned Ophelia, and she looked at Evelyn and Osborne in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned and pushed Evelyn away in annoyance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please stay away from me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was full of disgust. Deep down, he felt guilty towards Evelyn, yet his hatred for her remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't feel that the relationship between him and Evelyn had been repaired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn noticed the disgust on Osborne's face, which pained her, but she quickly calmed down and looked apologetic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry. I was just too excited."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then lowered her head silently and walked back to Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia still looked at her in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She believed Evelyn's rush into Osborne's arms, tight embrace, and tears were more than just excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was more like her feelings that had been suppressed for too long finally found an outlet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia wanted to ask but, in the end, said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gazed at Osborne with a strange expression, shocked that it was her ex-husband, once the object of her scorn, who saved her in her hour of need.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia wanted to say something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could say anything, Osborne, with a chilling gaze, interrupted her as if she were a stranger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cut the crap!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't overthink. I came here to save you not because I still care about you, or for any other reason. It's just because I don't like him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at Wesley again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered, "Wesley, do you know who I hate the most in my life? The people who force innocent women to do things they don't want to! And you are not only the behind-the-scenes financier of the Scarlet Gang, but today, you are going to insult them in public.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that I know this, I can't just ignore it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, are you ready to go to hell?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne walked towards Wesley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley was furious. "Osborne, drop the act, okay? You are a coward! What qualifications do you have to say that to me? You want to kill me? Come on, if you can!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see whether you kill me or I kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this ferociously, Wesley snatched the pistol from his men's hands, aimed at Osborne without hesitation, and pulled the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing this, Ophelia and Evelyn were both shocked, crying out instinctively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gunshots erupted, flames spewed from the muzzle, and bullets barraged Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Osborne smiled with a look of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His ocular energy halted all bullets mid-air right before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly and grabbed a bullet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he shook his wrist, and the bullet flew back at a terrifying speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Puff!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hole appeared on Wesley's forehead, from which blood and brain matter leaked slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley's eyes </span><span>widened,</span><span> his face full of fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, he could no longer move. The world before his eyes began to spin and then suddenly became dark and quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley's body fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he fell, those around him fell silent, unable to make a sound, engulfing the area in complete quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia and Evelyn both gaped at Osborne.</span></p></div>
