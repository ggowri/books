        <h1>Chapter 119 Activating the Blood Cross</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of blood-red light erupted violently from the cross necklace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire room seemed to transform into a sea of crimson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne felt paralyzed, as if a monstrous weight was crushing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was frozen with terror, unable to move or react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cross necklace seemed to come alive, slowly drifting toward him, radiating an intense, sinister, blood-red glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The light was eerie and frightening as if countless vengeful spirits were swirling within it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's happening?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in disbelief as he noticed the metal chain of the Blood Cross rapidly dissolving in the red light, leaving only a peculiar cross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cross floated to his chest, pressing firmly against his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the red light flashed violently, and Osborne lost sight of everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he could see again, the room was bathed in normal light, and the oppressive red glow had vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was finally able to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What just happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tore open his shirt and stared at his chest in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There, where the necklace had been, was now a cross tattoo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He exclaimed, "A tattoo? What happened to the necklace?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where did it go? Why do I have a tattoo now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The events that had just unfolded were utterly baffling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "This is completely unscientific!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cross necklace had vanished, leaving behind only the tattoo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel a powerful force near his heart as if it were ready to surge through him at any moment if he wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could this really be Cain's Blood Cross? And this force... could it be the power of the Blood Cross?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hesitant but curious, Osborne decided to test the power. He focused his mind, and immediately, a tremendous force erupted from the tattoo, flooding into his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heartbeat accelerated rapidly, pumping an immense power throughout his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, his body began to change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His short hair grew uncontrollably, transforming into long, flowing locks of blood-red hair resembling streams of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two sharp fangs emerged from his mouth, and his fingers grew into long, dagger-like claws.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even his face became paler and more angular.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned. He felt power coursing through him, a force strong enough to kill a wild beast with a single punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at his red hair, which, with a mere thought, extended and hardened like steel wires. It pierced through the wall, leaving a multitude of tiny holes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My hair can be used as a weapon? Who could withstand a close-range attack?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then turned his attention to his sharp claws. With a gentle swipe on the wall, he left behind five terrifying gashes. They were sharper than any steel knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured, "This is insane!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have I really transformed into a Blood Clan member?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed a mirror, stared at his now menacingly handsome face, and marveled at the changes in his body. The overwhelming strength and the new abilities left him in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, "If I faced Paul again now, I'd be surprised if he could block even a single move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's strange - Paul's Blood Clan transformation seems different from mine. For one, his hair didn't change. What's up with that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his confusion, Osborne relished his current state. After transforming into a Blood Clan member, his strength had at least doubled, possibly even more. This could easily become his trump card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided to practice deactivating the transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't take long for Osborne to get the hang of it. As soon as he focused on reverting to his original form, the power flowed back into the cross-shaped tattoo on his chest, and he returned to his normal appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne noticed that the power seemed a bit weaker than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like the more I use this power, the less it becomes. How can I replenish it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, Osborne delved into studying the cross tattoo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did it allow him to transform into a Blood Clan, but it also could repel metahuman attacks - both tangible and intangible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For example, it could block Satan's Eye's surveillance and Clarissa's lie-detection abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With its current power, the tattoo could withstand several full-force attacks from Class C+ metahumans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The way to recharge the tattoo's power was surprisingly straightforward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the tattoo's strength ran low, it would draw from Osborne's own blood to quickly regain its energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought with a wry smile, "No wonder it's called the Blood Cross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So it needs blood to recharge? How much blood do I even have to give it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hope I can find another way to replenish its power soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, I'll end up being drained dry!"</span></p></div>
