        <h1>Chapter 260 Trap</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's calm words struck Ava Mariposa's ears like a thunderclap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised her head and looked at Osborne in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How are you not affected? How dare you call me ugly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's pretty face was full of anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked, "You are ugly. So, before I get mad, get off me. Do not make me use force."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava grew even angrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard, you deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes blazed with fury, ready to act, but then she paused, seemingly listening to commands through an earpiece.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next second, she calmed down, gave Osborne a strange smile full of contempt, and began tearing her dress and hair into a mess. She clung to Osborne's arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Assault!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone is trying to rape me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's desperate cries echoed far, even reaching the first floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He snorted coldly and gave Ava a light push, making her fall to the ground. Seeing her disheveled state, Osborne frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before Osborne could react, hurried footsteps approached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dozen figures appeared nearby, looking at the shouting Ava lying on the ground with gloomy faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, you dare touch my woman and hit her? You are dead!" shouted a young man at the front, his face dark with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Blake Knight, the second leader of </span><span>Mayby</span><span> City's biggest gang, the Scarlet Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Surround him!" Blake ordered. Instantly, over ten Scarlet Gang members encircled Osborne, each with a cold, murderous look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at them and laughed inwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, this is the game. Use a seductive woman to lure me in, record it if I take the bait, and then use it against me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I do not, Ava screams assault, and I am smeared. With no witnesses, people would believe I did something to her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having figured it out, he let out a cold laugh; now that he knew the enemy's plot, dealing with it would be much easier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, what is the plan now? You dared touch my woman; you must pay the price!" Blake sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "What do you suggest?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking Osborne had surrendered, Blake scoffed, "Ava is mine. Touching her is touching me. But since you did not actually succeed, I would not kill you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kneel, apologize, and let me break your legs. Then this ends. Otherwise, you are dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I do not make you pay dearly, how can I continue to thrive in the world? How can I remain the second leader of the Scarlet Gang?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Blake finished speaking, his expression was cold and cruel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Second leader of the Scarlet Gang?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne realized Blake's identity, and his expression instantly turned cold and fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said coldly, "So you are from the Scarlet Gang. If I am not mistaken, the Scarlet Gang is involved in the adult entertainment business, right? Most of the adult venues in </span><span>Mayby</span><span> City are controlled by the Scarlet Gang, aren't they?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You even force homeless women, and even kidnap respectable women, controlling their bodies and forcing them to sell themselves for your profit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Blake not only did not get angry, but instead looked quite proud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That is right! Most entertainment spots here are ours. Knowing who I am, you should know what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kneel and apologize, let me break your legs," Blake said sternly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne laughed icily, "Scum like you want me to apologize? I hate gangs that sell drugs in slums and force women into prostitution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are unlucky to meet me today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"None of you will leave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne coldly said, then stepped towards Blake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake's face darkened as he gritted his teeth and said, "You are asking for death! Everyone, attack together! First, break his arms and legs, then expose his dirty secrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, no matter what, we're going to make him a disgrace to </span><span>Mayby</span><span> City!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Blake moved swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His nickname 'Black Knife' came from his skill with a pitch-black short knife, which he had used to stab countless disobedient women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he drew out his black knife and thrust it fiercely towards Osborne's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake snarled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, his subordinates were not idle; they drew their weapons and rushed towards Osborne with shouts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Various weapons were suddenly thrust into Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne appeared stunned, standing still and motionless, letting the weapons fall upon him.</span></p></div>
