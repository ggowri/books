        <h1>Chapter 21 Ex-wife’s Fiancé</h1>
        <div><p>Wesley shrugged and said nothing more.</p><p>As more people arrived, the news that Osborne was a VIP of the Draco Group began to spread among the prominent figures at the event. Many of them finally mustered the courage to approach him.</p><p>“Mr. Augustine, I am Timothy Watson, the head of the Watson family. We specialize in hotel and restaurant services. Here’s my business card and a 50% VIP discount card for Watson Haven. Please accept it. When you have the time, I’ll make sure to give you a warm welcome.”</p><p>“Mr. Augustine I am Jenny Carter, the heir of the Carter family. Here’s my business card. Our family business focuses on transportation. I hope to have the opportunity to cooperate with you.”</p><p>“Mr. Augustine, I am…”</p><p>All the prominent business figures and affluent individuals of Mayby City crowded around Osborne, each vying to introduce themselves and present their business cards.</p><p>Osborne felt somewhat helpless. He had already mentioned that he was just an ordinary person, not a notable figure, but these people didn’t believe him.</p><p>It was because they knew that an ordinary person wouldn’t be in this event, an ordinary person wouldn’t be a VIP at Draco Auction House, and an ordinary person wouldn’t have Debbe personally accompanying them.</p><p>These prominent figures were very shrewd and didn’t believe Osborne’s explanation. They knew that any advantage from a VIP could be highly profitable for them.</p><p>So, he simply stopped explaining and accepted every business card handed to him.</p><p>Some beautiful and alluring women even discreetly gave Osborne their hotel room keys, which he also took to prevent them from bugging him.</p><p>When Ophelia and Wesley saw this, they looked very displeased, their faces showing clear signs of jealousy and resentment.</p><p>In their view, Osborne was just a nobody, yet with a fake VIP status, he was more admired than they were, surrounded by so many important figures. How could they not be jealous?</p><p>Right then, Wesley’s phone rang. After answering the call, his eyes lit up, and a sneer appeared on his face.</p><p>He chuckled mockingly, “So that’s how it is… Ophelia, it turns out that loser’s VIP status is indeed fake. He just got lucky and received a VIP experience card.”</p><p>“VIP experience card?” Ophelia asked.</p><p>Ophelia was surprised. “So it was a VIP experience card. No wonder that loser suddenly became a VIP.” She then looked at Osborne with disdain.</p><p>Wesley remarked with a chill in his voice, “Let’s go. We’re going to expose that loser right now.” With that, he walked toward Osborne with a sneer.</p><p>When Wesley saw that Osborne was busy mingling, he snorted before suddenly speaking loudly, “Ha, this is really strange.</p><p>“A worthless commoner who got lucky with a VIP experience card actually thinks he’s a VIP? A loser will always be a loser. Even if many people flock to him, he can’t hide his lowly nature as a commoner.”</p><p>Wesley’s remarks silenced everyone around. The big shots around were all surprised and turned to look at him.</p><p>Someone familiar with Wesley quickly asked, “Mr. Ashford, what do you mean by this? Who are you calling a loser?”</p><p>“Of course, I’m talking about him.” </p><p>Wesley laughed disdainfully and pointed at Osborne.</p><p>“Everyone, you’ve all been fooled by this loser. He is not some big shot, nor does he have any powerful background. He’s just an orphan and a lowly commoner. The only reason he is here is because he got lucky and received a VIP experience card.</p><p>“This loser is just pretending to be someone important. All those business cards and special offers you gave him were for nothing.</p><p>“And those who gave hotel room keys, be careful not to lose both your reputation and your dignity.”</p><p>After Wesley spoke disdainfully, everyone’s faces shifted, and they looked at Osborne with tight frowns.</p></div>
