        <h1>Chapter 1111 The Anxious Gerardo</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Faster! Faster!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo was in a state of panic. In front of him lay three divine corpses: the Wolf God, the Titan God, and the Vampire God.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These gods had long been dead, yet their bodies were remarkably well-preserved. Their skin still retained some elasticity, and traces of divine blood lingered within them, no longer flowing but still potent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the outside, they looked almost alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After escaping from Rosmandi, Gerardo had rushed to this secret chamber designed for storing divine remains, ready to merge with the third corpse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that Osborne would be coming for revenge. If he didn't fuse with the third divine body, he stood no chance against Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it hadn't been for Armstrong's distraction, he would have been dead already.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on! Hurry it up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's anxiety was palpable. To buy himself some time, he had ordered his Class S clones, still in Rosmandi, to attack the Augustine family, hoping to force Osborne to divert his attention and delay his pursuit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just moments ago, Gerardo felt a wave of despair wash over him as he sensed his Class S clones being wiped out one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's eyes narrowed as he felt the unmistakable rumble of battle outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew exactly what was happening. "Osborne's coming! That bastard is here with his Blood Demon goons, ready to tear this place apart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Gerardo seethed with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time in years that someone had dared to invade his stronghold. As he felt the loss of his clones, a mix of fury and terror surged within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are they falling so quickly?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had a thousand Class S clones guarding my lair! And dozens of Class S Human Slaves! How the hell is Osborne managing to take them down? That bastard!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just wait until I merge with this third divine body&mdash;I'll make you pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, he pushed aside his fears and focused on the fusion process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo had chosen to merge with the Wolf God's corpse, as the Titan God's body was far too massive for a quick fusion, and the Vampire God's essence was too unpredictable for him to gamble on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo growled, "Once I successfully fuse with the Wolf God's body, my power will skyrocket! It won't just be a simple two plus one; I'll jump to an entirely new level! Even against a true god, I won't be outmatched!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be more than a match for Helios, the top warrior of Blue Planet! I'll reclaim everything I've lost!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you'll be the first to die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter how formidable you think you are, you won't stand a chance against me. I'll make sure you suffer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo had already reached a seventy percent fusion with the Wolf God's essence, using a secret method. The corpse began to dissolve into a flurry of glowing particles, rapidly integrating into his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this method came with severe risks&mdash;one wrong move could lead to his body disintegrating or, at the very least, leaving him gravely injured. But he couldn't afford to think about that now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and his Blood Demon crew were storming in. Gerardo had to complete the fusion to turn the tide!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on! Hurry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was on the edge of his seat, anxiously awaiting the moment of success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Wolf God's body grew dimmer as most of it transformed into light and merged with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eighty percent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ninety percent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo was practically vibrating with excitement; success was just around the corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, the door to the chamber burst open, and a frantic voice called out, "Mr. Aniston, something's wrong! Osborne is attacking!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's expression shifted dramatically, his face darkening with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "How dare anyone disturb me at such a crucial moment? They must be looking for trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But once he recognized who had approached, the fury evaporated, replaced by a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, Ophelia! You don't need to worry; everything is under control. I'm just luring the enemy in, and soon they</span><span>'</span><span>ll understand exactly who they're dealing with!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia looked frantic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But there are so many Class S warriors outside! They're incredibly powerful, and the Jackals and the Human Slaves almost can't hold attackers off anymore! They'll break in and kill us all in no time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Aniston, you have to protect me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With fear written all over her face, Ophelia edged closer to Gerardo as if seeking refuge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo frowned and snorted dismissively. "I told you not to worry! In the end, I'll be the one standing victorious! Besides, even if we can't fend them off, I'll ensure your escape. You're my most gifted disciple; your future achievements will surpass mine. There's no way I'm letting anything happen to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone softened as he reassured the panicked Ophelia, his demeanor surprisingly gentle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moved, Ophelia lit up with gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Aniston, you're the best mentor, I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could finish, a scream tore through the air as Gerardo suddenly clutched his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked down, and to his horror, a dagger was plunged deep into his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia stood by, an odd expression flickering across her face as she stared at him.</span></p></div>
