        <h1>Chapter 1224 Stealing the Sanctuary Casket</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was in deep thought, trying to devise a plan to divert the attention of the Deschanel family's deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed to ensure they couldn't immediately target the Augustine family in Newport City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer power of the thirty-six Deschanel family deities was overwhelming; given the Augustine family's current strength, they stood no chance against such formidable foes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as Osborne was around, the Deschanel family wouldn't be able to wipe out the Augustine family entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, if the situation turned dire, he could always use interdimensional travel to whisk everyone away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could find a remote spot and bury the Augustine family deep underground, and even the mightiest Deschanel family wouldn't be able to sniff them out easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne didn't want to resort to that unless absolutely necessary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For one, hiding like that would be utterly humiliating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Secondly, if he did, the Augustine family's reputation would take a massive hit, jeopardizing his plans to recruit for the Draco Armed Services Branch and establish a second powerful military force for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, escape was a last resort, not a first option.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne racked his brain, trying to figure out how to shift the Deschanel family's focus away from the Augustine family and onto something else entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only idea that came to mind was to steal something&mdash;specifically, the Sanctuary Caskets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within the Deschanel family's sanctuary, there were one hundred of these Caskets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Osborne didn't know exactly what they were, he understood their significance; they were the reason the Deschanel family deities had survived from the Age of Gods to the present day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, it was clear that these Sanctuary Caskets must be incredibly valuable and crucial to the Deschanel family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His plan was simple&mdash;steal all thirty-six of the already empty Sanctuary Caskets, and if he could manage it, take those still containing slumbering deities as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne succeeded, the Deschanel family would undoubtedly be furious, and their priority would shift to recovering the stolen Caskets rather than dealing with what they considered a minor threat&mdash;the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had everything mapped out and was just waiting for the right moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed the Deschanel family deities to leave their sanctuary, and now, that moment had arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seizing the opportunity, he activated his Phantom Steps and slipped into the Deschanel family's sanctuary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, the atmosphere was eerily quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only a handful of Deschanel family members were present, dusting off the Sanctuary Caskets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These individuals were no pushovers; all of them were Class S warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to Osborne, they were no different from ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confirming that only a small group of Class S warriors were guarding the Sanctuary Caskets, Osborne retreated momentarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he was ready to force his way in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His spatial power, if possible, was best kept under wraps. After all, spatial power was as rare as a hen's teeth, and even a whiff of it could easily lead others to guess his identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He approached the sanctuary's entrance, and by sheer luck, it hadn't been shut tight yet, likely due to the recent comings and goings of others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This worked to Osborne's advantage. A surge of energy coursed through him as he quickly altered his appearance, transforming into that of a middle-aged man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift kick, he burst through the sanctuary door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell are you?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deschanel family members inside erupted in outrage, their voices echoing in the sacred space. This was their holy ground, and they were taken aback that someone would dare to kick the door in like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A bunch of ants!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne growled, his voice rough and scratchy, deliberately disguised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, he activated Psychic Blast!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though psychic power was no longer Osborne's primary power, his mental strength was still formidable. It was more than enough to deal with a dozen or so Class S warriors from the Deschanel family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the Deschanel family's warriors groaned, blood trickling from their noses and mouths. Their bodies went limp, collapsing like sacks of rubbish, unconscious before they even hit the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the path cleared, Osborne dashed deeper into the sanctuary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before him stood a hundred massive stone coffins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sanctuary Caskets!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were the very reasons the Deschanel family possessed a hundred divine warriors who had survived since the Age of Gods. This was an absolute treasure!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At present, thirty-six of these Sanctuary Caskets were already empty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second thought, Osborne stowed the thirty-six </span><span>empty</span><span> caskets into his Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes then locked onto the remaining sixty-four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside these coffins slept more of the Deschanel family's gods. They would awaken soon, making the Deschanel family even more formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew that among these caskets lay Terrence, the patriarch of the Deschanel clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Terrence, a top-tier Deity Overlord warrior."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In his prime, he was one of the most powerful warriors below the Deity King. Once he wakes, who could stand against him if the Deity King isn't around?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Should I take the rest of the caskets, too?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It would weaken the Deschanel family, but there's risk. If I disturb the sleeping gods, I'll be in deep trouble..."</span></p></div>
