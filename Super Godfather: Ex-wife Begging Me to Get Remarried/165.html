        <h1>Chapter 165 Arrogant Enforcement Team</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened at the manor?" Osborne grabbed a member of the Surveillance Group at the gate and asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Captain Osborne." The guard quickly saluted and whispered. "A big shot has arrived at the manor. It was quite the spectacle, and they brought many members of the Enforcement Team. As soon as they arrived, they replaced us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A big shot, huh?" Osborne raised an eyebrow. Hearing that nothing was wrong, he relaxed a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, who could this big shot be to warrant such a grand entrance? Bringing so many members of the Mayby City Enforcement Team was quite unusual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Mayby City Enforcement Team, being an official law enforcement body, would not be dispatched easily. Even though Clarissa had faced numerous attacks, the Enforcement Team always arrived late, and their investigations led nowhere. This alone showed how insignificant the Mayby City Enforcement Team seemed to be. But to underestimate their power would be a fatal mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Enforcement Team was undoubtedly the most formidable force in Mayby City. Whether in terms of numbers, equipment, or the average combat capability of its members, it was among the strongest. Its low profile was simply because it seldom took action and was reluctant to get involved in matters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Enforcement Team decided to, they could wipe out every underground gang in Mayby City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who could it be?" Osborne was intensely curious about who had enough influence to bring so many enforcement members to the Radcliffe Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had a hunch but wasn't sure yet, so he strode into the manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Osborne arrived outside the Radcliffe Manor. From a distance, he saw the manor surrounded by heavily armed enforcement members, looking more like the Radcliffe family's bodyguards than their own security detail, which had been pushed to the periphery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop right there!" Osborne was halted by the enforcement members before he reached the manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leading Enforcement Team member spoke to Osborne coldly, "Important matters are being discussed inside. No one is allowed to enter!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even me?" Osborne frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leading enforcement officer sneered, not bothering to answer. He looked arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, this is our captain!" Violet approached and sternly addressed the leading enforcement officer at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officer gave Osborne another once-over, then sneered, "He might be your captain, but he's not ours! I don't care who he is. My orders are to guard this place, and no one is allowed in! Get lost, or don't blame me for being rude!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leading officer was incredibly overbearing, waving his weapon menacingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you say?" Violet was furious. "How dare you to tell our captain to get lost? Who do you think you are? This is the Radcliffe Manor, a private estate, not your Enforcement Team's domain!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she finished, members of the Bodyguard Unit Four gathered around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right, this is private property, not your Enforcement Team's territory! How dare you act so arrogantly here? Where were you when we needed you? Now you show up just to throw your weight around? Who do you think you are?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Step aside! Let our captain through!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of Bodyguard Unit Four shouted angrily, squaring off against the enforcement officers, and tension quickly rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You must have a death wish!" The leading officer was enraged. He suddenly raised his gun, flicked off the safety, and aimed it at the members of the Bodyguard Unit Four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost! Do you dare to attack the Enforcement Team? Make a move, and I'll kill you all right here! In Mayby City, even if we kill you, you'll die for nothing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words left the members of the Bodyguard Unit Four seething with anger, but they didn't dare make a move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how much they despised the Enforcement Team, they knew better than to provoke an official armed force. Frustration and resentment were written all over their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!" Osborne snorted at this time. He suddenly reached out and grabbed the leading officer's gun, forcing the muzzle downward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officer was immediately furious, desperately trying to lift the gun, but it felt like a mountain was pressing down on it. He couldn't budge it an inch. His expression changed, and he shouted angrily, "How dare you touch me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked. "The Enforcement Team, huh? Let me remind you again, here is the Radcliffe Manor. It is a sacred private property. Even as the Enforcement Team, you have no right to be here without proper legal procedures!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dare to point a gun at my team members on private property? Do you believe I can kill you without consequence? And I will find a lawyer to sue you! Sue you until the Enforcement Team kicks you out, and sue you until you're bankrupt!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't believe me? Try me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's icy words made the officer's face darken further. He hadn't expected Osborne to not only be unafraid of the Enforcement Team but also to stand up to him directly, even threatening to kill him and sue him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officer was seething with rage but didn't dare to move the gun again. He said coldly, "You dare to challenge the Enforcement Team? You're courting death, kid! You just wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he grabbed his walkie-talkie and began making a call.</span></p></div>
