        <h1>Chapter 549 Eliminate Four of Them</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's eyes fixed on the seven men standing before him, contemplating who to target first, who to take down swiftly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Among them, Sam was undoubtedly the strongest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alongside him were David and Rodney, both possessing Class AA strength. Even in a surprise attack, Osborne couldn't be certain of victory against them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His target, then, would have to be the other four&mdash;Tony, Kent, Henry, and John.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These four were all Class A+, with no significant difference in strength among them. Most importantly, they seemed to have temporarily joined forces and were standing relatively close to each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's decided," Osborne thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There are nine branch bloodlines in the Augustine family, each with a designated heir. Excluding Lance, that leaves these seven as my rivals.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I can eliminate these four first, I'll drastically reduce the competition. Even though their families have other participants in the Branch Bloodline Competition, once the heirs are out, they won't be competing for the emblem anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That'll take a lot of pressure off me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Having made up his mind, Osborne didn't act immediately. The seven men were still vigilant, and a hasty attack wouldn't guarantee success.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He needed to wait for the right moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the minutes ticked by, he watched and waited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Four minutes passed quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, there was just one minute left before the signal from his emblem would be transmitted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other people from the various branch bloodlines were drawing nearer, causing the seven men to relax slightly, their tension visibly easing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They each pulled out their tracking devices, ready to locate Osborne as soon as the signal was emitted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ten seconds!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nine seconds!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eight seconds!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The seven men exchanged knowing smirks as the countdown neared its end. At the final moment, they all pressed the buttons on their devices, initiating the process to pinpoint Osborne's location.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the next second, two red dots appeared on their screens.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One was to the north, seemingly headed towards the highest peak of the Lostridge Mountains, roughly six miles away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other was right where they stood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The unexpected result left them stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's going on? Is the tracker malfunctioning? Why is there a red dot right here with us?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Strange!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Confusion marked their faces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And in that moment of surprise, Osborne saw his chance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without hesitation, he unleashed his attack on Tony, Kent, Henry, and John.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ninefold Tide Crash!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne channeled all his power into executing the advanced martial art, Ninefold Tide Crash.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His mastery of it had reached the pinnacle, enabling him to unleash all nine waves at their fullest potential, effectively doubling his strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Already formidable, Osborne's power became even more terrifying under the enhancement of Ninefold Tide Crash.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The earth beneath their feet roared and exploded violently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tony, Kent, Henry, and John had no time to react. The ground beneath them erupted, sending them flying through the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Shit!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Watch out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We're under attack!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their desperate cries echoed as Osborne's attack struck, slamming into them with crushing force. They were thrown violently into the air, blood spewing from their mouths as their faces turned deathly pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their eyes widened in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That damned bastard! He didn't run away&mdash;he's been hiding underground, waiting to ambush us!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn it! How dare he!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The four were severely injured in an instant. Their respective branch bloodlines' people, witnessing the scene, turned pale with shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Watch out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Watch out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Dozens of figures sprang into action, rushing to protect their heirs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But someone was faster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne, having successfully landed his initial blow, didn't give them a chance to recover. He tore open a dimensional rift, appearing behind the four men in the blink of an eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A cold smile curved his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Time for you to be eliminated."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Osborne struck again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The four men, still airborne and unable to stabilize themselves, were hit once more. Osborne's blow sent them crashing into the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They were unconscious before they even realized what had happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their participation in the Branch Bloodline Competition was over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tony, Kent, Henry, and John were eliminated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The attack had been so sudden that no one had time to react. Only after the four men had been knocked unconscious did the others realize what had happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam stared at Osborne in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">David's eyes narrowed, a cold glint flashing within them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney's eyes sparkled with a strange excitement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the ones most enraged were the families of the eliminated men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Branch Bloodline Competition had barely begun, and their heirs were already out of the running?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their chances of securing the title of heir were gone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They couldn't accept it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That bastard ambushed our young master. We can't let him get away with it! Let's avenge them&mdash;attack him together, kill him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Forty men from the four branch bloodlines were furious and began to attack Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Every one of them was at least Class A, some even Class A+.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They launched a barrage of powerful attacks, aiming to overwhelm Osborne.</p></div>
