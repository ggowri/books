        <h1>Chapter 80 Counterattack</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne looked at Thomas. Ocular energy instantly enveloped Thomas. It was like an invisible big hand slapped Thomas hard on the back of his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Thomas fell forward violently. His head hit the door of the sentry box. Blood flowed everywhere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Thomas turned around angrily and stared at the people behind him. &ldquo;Assholes, who hit me? Do you want to die?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The other eight people were all confused. They did nothing but see Thomas suddenly fall forward with blood flowing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Faced with Thomas&rsquo; rage, they looked at each other in bewilderment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t us. We didn&rsquo;t do anything.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s not us.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Thomas was furious. &ldquo;Who else could it be? You are the only ones behind me. Am I wrongly accusing you? I&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Before Thomas could finish his words, he suddenly felt another hard slap on the back of his head. He immediately fell forward again. He felt a buzzing in his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The other eight people were dumbfounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">And then, something even more shocking happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Thomas&rsquo; body, which was lying on the ground, suddenly floated up. He started to bump left and right like a deflated and out-of-control balloon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Thomas&rsquo; head hit the sentry box and then the ground. He was soon covered in blood and fainted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The other eight people were all terrified at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Only Osborne in the guard booth smiled coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He looked at the eight people again. Ocular energy covered them. The invisible big hand immediately controlled the eight people and began to slap them fiercely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Heavy slaps landed on their faces. Their blood spurted out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Only after they were all knocked unconscious did Osborne retract ocular energy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They fell limply to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Looking at the nine people who had fainted, Osborne finally felt much relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He sneered and turned on the intercom. &ldquo;Third security team here. Something&rsquo;s up at the main gate. Enemy sneak attack! Possible metahuman!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The security team&rsquo;s job was to stand guard and patrol. They&rsquo;d contact HQ and wait for backup if they spotted anything unusual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Soon, the support team arrived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The bodyguards of the Radcliffe family were alarmed and surrounded the gate from all directions. They were aiming their guns at this site from a distance. Their numbers were increasing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In just three minutes, more than fifty bodyguards gathered at the main gate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul, as the captain of the bodyguard team, came as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Everyone was watching the situation here from afar. They looked alert and cautious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But when they saw it clearly, they were all surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Outside the sentry box, nine members of the third security team were all lying on the ground. Their faces were covered in blood. Their heads were swollen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Osborne still stood in the guard booth like a spear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; After making sure there was no danger, Paul and his bodyguards came.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul looked at the nine people who had fainted. But Osborne was unharmed. Paul frowned. &ldquo;Osborne, were you the one who gave the warning?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne nodded calmly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I saw that they were suddenly attacked. I immediately warned you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul snorted coldly, &ldquo;Did you see who attacked them?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lying. You are all part of the same team. Why were all nine of them knocked out while you were unharmed? Tell me. Did you knock them out?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne sneered, &ldquo;Captain Paul, I&rsquo;m not talking nonsense. If you want to frame me, at least show me some evidence. Which dog eye of yours saw that I did it?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After he finished speaking, all the bodyguards were stunned and looked at Osborne in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They thought, <span style="font-style: italic;">How dare Osborne talk to Paul like this? Doesn&rsquo;t he want to work in the Radcliffe family anymore?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, many people took a few steps back. They were trying to indicate that they had nothing to do with Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul looked gloomy. &ldquo;What did you say? How dare you scold me?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne smiled faintly, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? You can frame me. Why can&rsquo;t I scold you? Don&rsquo;t you know who you are?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Osborne finished speaking, everyone was even more dumbfounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul clenched his fists fiercely as if he would attack Osborne in the next second.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Osborne looked calm and fearless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If he wanted to complete the test of succession and become the captain of the bodyguards, Paul must leave. Sooner or later, they would turn against each other. In that case, Osborne didn&rsquo;t need to endure him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Osborne, are you provoking me?&rdquo; Paul&rsquo;s voice was extremely cold. He walked towards Osborne step by step. Everyone looked at Osborne with pity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;He is finished!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;He dares to provoke Captain Paul like this. Captain Paul will teach him a lesson he will never forget.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I bet he&rsquo;ll be crippled.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I think he may be unable to leave the wheelchair for the rest of his life.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;He is so reckless.&rdquo;</p></div>
