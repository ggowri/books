        <h1>Chapter 1239 A Treasure Trove of Blood Energy</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Byrd family's fate was sealed in an instant, their lineage all but obliterated by a merciless strike from Joseph. In that fleeting moment, tens of thousands of Byrd family members met their end, with most being Class A warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, there were hundreds of Class S warriors, including six Junior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their deaths, an immense wave of blood energy was unleashed, and Osborne couldn't believe his luck. Without lifting a finger, he had stumbled into a treasure trove of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This much blood energy? It must be enough to allow several Blood Demon members to forge Divine Bone and Divine Flesh, maybe even break through to godhood!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Deschanel family has split into twelve factions to wage war on the League of Divine Descent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder how the other eleven families are faring?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With Joseph so calm about moving on to the next target, it's clear their assaults are going smoothly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That means, at this very moment, eleven Divine Families are facing annihilation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just imagine how vast their accumulated blood energy must be!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of it sent Osborne's heart racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Divine Families were scattered across various countries. Even if others could tap into the blood energy, there was simply no way they could catch up in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the moment they trekked over thousands of miles, the precious blood energy would have already dissipated into the air, leaving them with nothing but disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne had a crucial advantage&mdash;his spatial power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could teleport across thousands of miles in a blink of an eye. With his ability to perform interdimensional travel, he could instantly leap thousands of miles, gathering blood energy from the ruins of the vanquished Divine Families for the Blood Demon members, aiding their ascent to godhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Resolved, Osborne sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, he used his interdimensional travel and arrived in Felona, thousands of miles away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As expected, Felona's Divine Family had been obliterated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this era, members of superpowers had begun forging Divine Bodies, transforming into gods, albeit merely Junior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the Deschanel family's thirty-six awakened gods were at least Intermediate Deities at their peak, on the brink of becoming Superior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Against them, Junior Deities were of little consequence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only if swarmed by a dozen or more would those Intermediate Deities be challenged, but grouped in teams of three, it would take at least fifty Junior Deities to pose a threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At present, no superpower had fifty deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deschanel family's assault was unstoppable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their sudden strike decimated the League of Divine Descent's Divine Families in a heartbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The few survivors were no match and were ultimately eliminated by the Deschanel family gods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne reached Felona, the Divine Family was a ghost of its former self. The air was thick with lingering blood energy, not as concentrated as at the Byrd family's site, but substantial nonetheless. Osborne collected it all, seizing this opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Relentlessly, Osborne used his spatial power, darting across nations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deschanel family effectively annihilated twelve Divine Families in their first attack, allowing Osborne to gather the blood energy they left behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This bountiful blood energy could empower dozens of Blood Demon members to ascend to godhood," Osborne mused with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he couldn't help but hope the Deschanel family would take out more Divine Families, letting him collect even more blood energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You Deschanel folks, you do all the hard work wiping out Divine Families, and I reap the rewards! With all this blood energy, I'll soon have enough Blood Demon members to become gods."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The next time you attack the Augustine family, you're going to get a surprise you'll never forget!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a resolute determination, Osborne sprang into action once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deschanel family's second wave of attacks was already underway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ideally, with just three rounds, the thirty-six Divine Families of the League of Divine Descent could be obliterated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the ideal scenario, of course. Osborne knew better than to underestimate the resistance the League could muster. It was highly unlikely that all thirty-six Divine Families would be eradicated without a fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, it was a certainty that the League would suffer significant losses this time around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Joseph was already gearing up for another elimination, this time targeting the Divine Family of Easionand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hoped to repeat his previous success. However, it quickly became evident that this Divine Family had caught wind of their impending doom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Joseph managed to demolish their structures, the casualties were far fewer than expected. Almost everyone had vanished into hiding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A frustrated grunt escaped Joseph's lips. "Ha! You think hiding underground will save you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think I can't find you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll shake you out of there and crush every last one of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he prepared to unleash a devastating attack, a voice boomed from the depths below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop right there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, ten Junior Deity warriors erupted from the ground, glaring at Joseph. Their eyes were ablaze with defiance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who the hell are you? Why are you attacking the League of Divine Descent?"</span></p></div>
