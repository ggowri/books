        <h1>Chapter 16 Honored Guest</h1>
        <div><p>Turning around, Osborne saw Evelyn and Ophelia.</p><p>Both were dressed to the nines, looking like a pair of stunning sisters, accompanied by a group of Caldwell family members and bodyguards.</p><p>Osborne even spotted Justin and Penelope among them.</p><p>At that moment, they all looked at Osborne with anger as if they wanted to kill him.</p><p>“Osborne, you jerk, didn’t you hear me? Why are you here?” Evelyn repeated angrily.</p><p>Osborne snorted, stared at Evelyn intently, and asked, “Does this place belong to the Caldwell family? Why can’t I be here? And why do you care where I go? Looks like you’re itching for another spanking, huh?”</p><p>As soon as she heard that, her eyes went wide, and a faint blush of embarrassment and fury swiftly spread across her lovely face.</p><p>Evelyn seemed to recall the scene from yesterday when Osborne angrily pinned her down on the sofa and relentlessly spanked her.</p><p>“Damn it!” she spat out through gritted teeth but didn’t dare to say anything, fearing it would raise suspicion.</p><p>Just then, Justin retorted, “How dare you talk to her like that, you worthless scum? Do you have a death wish?”</p><p>Osborne sneered, “Justin, you should clean up your mess first. Don’t think that speaking up for her will make Ophelia stop investigating you.”</p><p>“You bastard!” Justin erupted in anger.</p><p>Osborne couldn’t be bothered with him and strode toward the VIP lane.</p><p>At that time, there was a long line at the entrance of the venue. Even the prestigious Caldwell family had to queue for inspection before entering. The VIP lane, however, remained empty and required no waiting.</p><p>Osborne had the Draco Star Wristlet, which allowed him access to any non-restricted area of the Draco Group without any hindrance. So, he naturally walked toward the VIP lane.</p><p>When the Caldwell family saw that, they immediately looked at him with disdain. To them, Osborne was just a commoner who couldn’t even get an invitation, so they were baffled that he wanted to use the VIP lane.</p><p>One of the Caldwells mocked, “Are you stupid, Osborne? The Draco Auction isn’t a place for losers like you.”</p><p>“Do you even have an invitation, you worthless scum?” another one chimed in.</p><p>Then, another added, “Even if you had an invitation, you still need to line up at the regular entrance like us. And you think you can use the VIP lane?”</p><p>Immediately after, one of them shouted, “A loser is always a loser. What a disgrace!”</p><p>The Caldwell family’s taunts drew the attention of others. When they saw Osborne getting out of a taxi and attempting to use the VIP lane, they couldn’t help but laugh. He instantly became the laughingstock of the crowd.</p><p>He remained unfazed and soon reached the ticket-checking point of the VIP lane.</p><p>Upon seeing that, the crowd erupted again, with one of them incredulously asking, “He’s really not turning back?”</p><p>Another shouted, “He’ll definitely be thrown out!”</p><p>“Maybe they’ll break his legs!” someone added.</p><p>Then, another mocked, “Even a wealthy heir would be thrown out for defying the Draco Auction House’s rules, let alone a loser like him.”</p><p>One laughed out loud and exclaimed, “He’s done for!”</p><p>Soon after, Osborne walked to the VIP ticket checkpoint under the crowd’s watchful eyes. Instead of presenting an invitation, he casually flicked his wrist.</p><p>Following that, the security guards and a few lovely hostesses at the VIP lane, who had been expressionless, suddenly smiled warmly. They all nodded politely to Osborne and greeted him. “Welcome, honored guest.”</p><p>In an instant, the Caldwell family members were all dumbfounded. It was as if they’d been dealt a heavy blow, leaving them in a daze.</p><p>When Justin saw that Osborne was about to enter through the VIP lane, he shouted, “Stop right there, Osborne!”</p><p>Justin sternly said, “Osborne, it’s bad enough that you cheat and lie to the Caldwell family, but you actually have the nerve to cause trouble at the Draco Auction House? I’m going to expose you today.”</p><p>With that, he rushed to the VIP lane entrance and told the security guards, “I’m Justin from the Caldwell family. I want to report him. He’s pretending to be a VIP.</p><p>“He’s actually just a commoner, an orphan with no background. Someone like him wouldn’t even qualify for an invitation, let alone be one of your VIP guests.</p><p>“He’s surely tricked you all. You should really investigate him. He’s posing as a VIP, and he should be severely punished for it.”</p></div>
