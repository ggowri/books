        <h1>Chapter 1322 A Surprising Discovery</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's target was the Pantheon League.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a moment to focus, sensing the energy fluctuations he had left on their Dimensional Microcosm vessel. They were still within the confines of Marcelin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his mastery over interdimensional travel, he set out for the distant city, ready to make his move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Osborne's current power level and Level Six spatial elemental essence, each leap he took could cover an impressive 6,000 miles. At this rate, he could reach any corner of Blue Planet in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a startling realization that made him ponder the scale of his surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honestly, I can't wait to see what Celestara, a realm thousands of times larger than Blue Planet, has in store! Once I deal with the Pantheon League, find my parents, and dismantle the Eityreia Organization, the Augustine family will rise to become the undisputed rulers of this world. No one will dare challenge us again! After that, it's time for me to pay a visit to Celestara. Isa's waiting for me, and I can't keep her hanging!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne gazed down at the sprawling city of Marcelin beneath him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The place was vast, home to millions bustling about in a whirlwind of activity. His senses guided him to the heart of the city, where the Pantheon League's Dimensional Microcosm vessel was tucked away deep underground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "So this is where you're hiding, right beneath the surface! It makes sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if members of the Pantheon League need to emerge from their lair occasionally, they can easily blend into the crowd. No wonder Grandpa couldn't track them down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I hadn't left my mark on your little Dimensional Microcosm vessel, I would never have found you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That tiny carrier is just the size of a stone. It could easily be concealed anywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Pantheon League must not realize how close I am to their secret lair."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smirk danced on his face as Osborne planned to dive deep underground and obliterate the Pantheon League once and for all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But suddenly, his expression hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait a minute... Is that... a Beast Tide? I thought they had disappeared!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why are there so many Ferocious Beasts gathering around this city?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It looks like another wave is about to strike!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Intrigued, Osborne activated Satan's Eye, peering deeper into the chaotic scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shock washed over him as he took in the sight&mdash;there were numerous Dark Exotic Beasts and a staggering number of Dark Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least a thousand Dark Deities!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was astounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had come to take on the Pantheon League, yet here he was, standing on the brink of a brewing storm involving over a thousand Dark Deities in the Pantheon League's hidden vicinity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had been lurking here for quite some time, showing no signs of attacking the city. Given their strength, it would have been effortless to wipe it out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were many of them who had reached the level of a Superior Deity, even a Transcendent Deity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's breath caught in his throat as he processed the magnitude of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recognizing the danger, he swiftly cast Phantom Steps, slipping into the parallel space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he could hide his energy signature with Eclipsing Mantra, nothing compared to the security of being entirely out of sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne contemplated briefly and decided against confronting the Pantheon League just yet. Instead, he edged closer to the gathering group of Dark Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed to understand their intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because, after all, the Dark Deities posed a far greater threat than the Pantheon League. They were the loyal followers of Lord Malevolence, responsible for the invasion of Celestara&mdash;the very same forces that had ravaged and destroyed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If given the opportunity, these Dark Deities would undoubtedly slaughter every human on Blue Planet without a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, "What on earth are they up to? For the past month, the Beast Tides around the world have been dwindling. Dark Exotic Beasts and Dark Deities seemed to vanish into thin air. But now it all makes sense&mdash;they must have gathered here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With over a thousand Dark Deities and hundreds of thousands of Dark Exotic Beasts, I wouldn't be surprised if ninety percent of all the Dark Deities on Blue Planet are right under my nose! If I can take them all out, we won't have to worry about their threat ever again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of bloodlust bubbled up within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Osborne, eliminating this group of Dark Deities took precedence over dealing with the Pantheon League. Their Dimensional Microcosm was nearby; no matter how cleverly it was hidden, he could track it down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But these Dark Deities? If they scattered and hid across the globe, finding and eliminating them would turn into a monumental headache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So it's settled. I'll wipe out these Dark Deities first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his resolve firm, Osborne maneuvered closer to the gathering. The air was thick with tension as he approached, surrounded by Dark Exotic Beasts of monstrous size and terrifying appearance&mdash;there were easily hundreds of thousands of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this was merely the surface level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that deep underground, there were likely millions more lurking in the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, over a thousand Dark Deities congregated in one spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne crept forward.</span></p></div>
