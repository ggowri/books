        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had thought that simply purchasing them and canceling their slave status would be enough to restore their freedom and allow them to live normal lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now he realized he had underestimated the complexity of their situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reality for the Human Community within Wild Flame City was far grimmer than he had imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every major faction had its own hunting teams, specifically tasked with tracking down those members of the Human Community who were hiding in the wild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone who wasn't part of one of the few powerful clans or working in a large mining operation would become prime targets for these hunters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people in front of him, aside from the five thousand or so war captives, had all been living in hiding until they were caught by these teams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Osborne granted them their freedom, they wouldn't dare to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all understood that the moment they stepped outside the slave market's walls, they would be under immediate threat from the hunting teams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One misstep, and they could find themselves back on the auction block.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do we do now?" Osborne's question hung in the air, met with silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they had known the answer, they wouldn't have ended up here in the first place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the Celestial Deity woman who had spoken before bit her lip and said, "There is a way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we want to live somewhat normally in Wild Flame City, there's a simple solution."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is it?" Osborne leaned forward, eager for any glimmer of hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And by the way, what's your name?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm Betty Horatio. These are my sisters, Thera and Sophia." She gestured to the other two women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded at the trio.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that they were sisters and had survived in the wild while dodging both Deathborns and the hunting teams spoke volumes about their resilience. Their ability to reach Celestial Deity status at such a young age was remarkable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their parents must have been extraordinary, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Betty, tell me what this solution is. If I can help, I'll do my best."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty took a deep breath. "The solution is to find a powerful faction to attach ourselves to for protection."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attach ourselves to a powerful faction?" Osborne frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Isn't that just another form of slavery?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why would they protect you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said with a frown, "That's not the best option. Any other options?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty's expression turned serious. "There's one last option we discussed. It's the best shot we have, but it's going to be incredibly difficult."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go on. What is it?" Osborne urged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a determined look, Betty said, "We need to form our own powerful faction. We have to protect ourselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne blinked in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Form a powerful faction? Just the three of you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't underestimating Betty and her sisters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group he had bought was strong; the three sisters were Celestial Deity level fighters, and they had 50 others at the Transcendent Deity level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Together, they constituted a formidable force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it still wasn't enough to be considered a true power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To stand firm in Wild Flame City and deter the major factions, they would need at least one Deity Overlord among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Wild Flame City, factions like the Swift family and the Fairfax family, while considered third-rate, were still taken seriously because they boasted Deity Overlord warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This power made it unwise for other major factions to provoke them. However, groups without a Deity Overlord were seen as insignificant and were easily crushed by a single Deity Overlord warrior from any established faction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty clenched her jaw as she spoke, her determination palpable, "It's true. We're lacking a Deity Overlord warrior, which means that even if we manage to form a faction, we won't be able to protect ourselves. But at least if we band together, we have a fighting chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we don't take this step, it won't be long before we find ourselves right back here, once again lined up to be sold off like cattle. We could end up as the lowest of slaves tormented and exploited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's why we want to unite and build our own force. No matter the outcome, we want to fight back! And everyone here believes you should lead us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, it was you who freed us when we were on the brink of hopelessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bought us and helped us regain our freedom, and we're deeply grateful. We hope you'll lead us in our struggle for the Human Community here in Wild Flame City!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she finished speaking, every pair of eyes turned to Osborne, bright with hope and expectation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback, his mind racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "They all want to come together and form a faction? And they want me as their leader to fight for the fate of the Human Community in Wild Flame City?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maybe... just maybe... this is an idea worth exploring."</span></p></div>
