        <h1>Chapter 1440 One Point Five Billion</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mind raced with visions of the future, imagining if one day he could reach the Deity King realm, just how potent his Infinite Devouring Eyes would become. "Man, if I ever hit Deity King, these eyes will be like bottomless pits! Their devouring power&mdash;unreal! Maybe I could even clean up the whole Celestara, suck up all that death scent, and make the place normal again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the Celestara cultivators could ditch Essence Crystals and just soak up the ambient energy to level up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart raced with excitement at the prospect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, Osborne had relied on extracting the core energy of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to expedite his progress, but it turned out even a Cosmic Treasure had finite resources. Once depleted, replenishment was a tall order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the deep space, had it not been for Osborne's excessive extraction, weakening the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, their encounter with the root creature might have ended differently&mdash;better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neither he nor the Lotus would have been so gravely wounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, even if the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity fully recuperated, Osborne couldn't afford to sap its core energy again for quick gains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant his advancement would slow down considerably&mdash;especially once he hit Transcendent Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each subsequent realm demanded immense energy, and relying solely on Essence Crystals would require a mountain of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Potentially years, even decades, just to inch forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deity Overlord, even Deity King, could take centuries, maybe millennia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pondered, feeling a knot of urgency, "Can Celestara's Human Community even hang on that long?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It should be tough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gotta hit Deity Overlord, even Deity King, asap if I wanna take down Lord Malevolence and support Isa and Celestara's homegrown folk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it takes centuries or millennia, they'll be toast by the time I get there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The advent of the Infinite Devouring Eyes finally eased some of this tension for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm gonna rocket to Deity Overlord, maybe Deity King, in no time. Before that, I need to quietly dismantle Lord Malevolence's Dark Deity Legion, re-wire them to be my Blood Clan, loyal only to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With resolve renewed, Osborne sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His next objective: stockpile as many top-grade Essence Crystals as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the Infinite Devouring Eyes ensured his ascent even without dedicated cultivation, those crystals would supercharge his progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was never one to turn down a speed boost in his journey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he needed all the top-grade Essence Crystals he could lay his hands on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this very moment, Osborne activated his Satan's Eye in search of top-grade Essence Crystals, instantly feeling a stark improvement in its X-ray vision abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to the formidable rock formations of Celestara, his previous vision had been heavily restricted, unable to peer too far, thus limiting his speed in locating Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, now, the efficacy of Satan's Eye's X-ray vision had soared&mdash;at least tenfold!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a single sweeping glance, he could discern all the mid-grade and top-grade Essence Crystals lurking within the rock layers across a radius of six miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The revelation filled Osborne with elation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If ordinary miners were to excavate such a six-mile expanse, it might take years, let alone in the deepest bowels of the mining area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Osborne, it was merely a glance to spot every mid-grade and top-grade Essence Crystal within that range.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the low-grade ones, he had long since deemed them beneath his notice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He promptly set into motion, employing spatial power to extract the identified crystals directly, depositing them into his Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, Osborne embarked on a whirlwind expedition, akin to a locust swarm, through the depths of the No. 9 mining area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only hitch was the paucity of top-grade Essence Crystals here; they were sparsely scattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Satan's Eye's aid, three hours weren't enough to scour the entirety of the No. 9 mining area's deepest reaches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne had to call it quits; the haul was already substantial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had amassed over 50 thousand top-grade Essence Crystals and an astounding 10 million mid-grade ones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He calculated the worth, drawing a sharp breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fifty thousand top-grade crystals equated to 500 million low-grade ones, and 10 million mid-grade ones amounted to a billion low-grade crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In total, that made for one point five billion low-grade worth&mdash;a staggering sum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lachlan's monthly military stipend was merely two thousand low-grade crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire No. 9 mining area's monthly yield barely scraped 200 million, and the Wild Flame Army's fifty-hundred-thousand-strong contingent needed only 500 million monthly for expenses.</span></p></div>
