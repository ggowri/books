        <h1>Chapter 761 Spatial Realm</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's face went blank, caught off guard by Emma's bluntness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He rubbed his nose awkwardly. "I'm not rejecting you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma's eyes sparkled with mischief. "Great! Then have sex with me. I promise I'll leave you alone after that. Deal?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked at him with a hopeful expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was stunned. In all his twenty-five years, he'd never met a woman who came on this strong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa had always been shy and reserved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa, on the other hand, was bold enough to initiate kisses and hugs, but if he ever tried to take it further, she'd knock him back in line.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had her limits and made sure he knew them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then there was his ex-wife, Ophelia. She was way out of his league, wealthier, more powerful. She usually called the shots, except in the bedroom, where he took the lead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for Ophelia's mother, Evelyn, their one time together had been a weird mix of revenge and regret, and she'd just gone along with it, not really into it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The only one who came close to Emma's level of boldness was Austin, who had been hell-bent on getting pregnant with his child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She'd been relentless, chasing after him like her life depended on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But even Austin had never been this blunt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne couldn't deny that Emma's direct approach was having an effect on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was a healthy, energetic guy, and here was a stunning woman practically throwing herself at him. It was hard to resist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He swallowed, his voice hoarse. "Just once?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma nodded enthusiastically, her face flushed. "Just once! You're way too much for me to handle more than that!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her words sent a jolt through him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without another word, he scooped her up and tossed her onto the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Emma, you're a real temptress, you know that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After speaking, Osborne leaned in, kissing Emma's neck and earlobes as his hands explored her delicate figure, his grip firm and insistent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma's face flushed, her head tilting back as soft, melodic moans escaped her lips, driving Osborne's breath to quicken in response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It didn't take long before both of them were stripped bare, facing each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as Osborne was about to take control, Emma suddenly flipped them over, pinning him beneath her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her face was flushed with a mix of excitement and mischief. "Let me take the lead this time," she whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before he could respond, she took charge, and soon the room was filled with the rhythm of their movements.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But thanks to Osborne's Spatial Prison, none of the sounds escaped the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Two hours later, Emma lay exhausted on Osborne's chest, breathing heavily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her fingers traced the lines of his strong chest, her eyes filled with a dreamy satisfaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I think I should head back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne nodded, feeling drained, not physically but mentally, from maintaining the barrier to keep her sounds contained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, you should go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma stood up, her eyes lingering on his well-built body as she playfully licked her lips. "You know, I've still got some energy left. How about another round?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne shot her a look, half amused, half warning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, okay, I'm just teasing! It's not just about the sex. I really like you, Osborne. Anyway, keep up the good work."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She leaned down, kissed him on the forehead, then got dressed and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After she was gone, Osborne sat up and began to cultivate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Strangely, after the sex with Emma, his mind felt sharper than ever, and his cultivation flowed effortlessly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Those tricky concepts he'd struggled with before now seemed to unravel before him as if a light had been switched on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So that's how it works?" he murmured, suddenly sitting upright, his eyes shining with realization.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Spatial Realm!" he whispered, and immediately, the space around him shifted, detaching from the main world as if he were in a Dimensional Space.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He could feel everything around him bending to his will. Energy from the void surged through him, making him feel invincible, like he could control everything with a mere thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With just a little effort, he found he could twist, stretch, and even collapse space at will.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In this spatial realm, Osborne felt like a god.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So this is the power of a Spatial Realm? I've actually mastered this advanced technique!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyes were filled with excitement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The realm's power was beyond what he had imagined. Anyone who entered it would be at his mercy, their strength drained while his own surged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He played with his newfound abilities, immensely satisfied. Although his domain wasn't yet unbreakable and could easily collapse when clashing with others, it still marked a significant leap in his strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But just as he was basking in his progress, he suddenly felt his previously sharp mind become sluggish.</p></div>
