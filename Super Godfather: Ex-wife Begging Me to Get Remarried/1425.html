        <h1>Chapter 1424 Human Overseers</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Malevolence Airship gradually slowed, finally touching down in front of a sprawling complex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A crowd of over a hundred people was already gathered there, all members of the Human Community, each boasting the strength of Superior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wore badges emblazoned with the title of overseer, signifying their authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Jeffrey led his team off the airship, the overseers greeted them with broad smiles, their faces alight with a mix of respect and flattery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Welcome, esteemed guests, to the No. 9 mining area!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please accept this small token of our appreciation. If there's anything you need, we'll do our utmost to assist you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before anyone could respond, the overseers began to shove small bags into the hands of Jeffrey and his team. Each bag was filled with Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, every member of Jeffrey's hundred-man squad received a bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The regular members found a thousand Essence Crystals inside theirs, while the squad leaders got two thousand. Jeffrey's bag contained an impressive five thousand Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a neat little sum, enough to cover their monthly military expenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bribery!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as blatant as it could get.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, there was no denying its effectiveness; Jeffrey and his crew's expressions softened, their usual coldness and pride melting away in the face of such blatant generosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not bad, you guys really know how to play the game," Jeffrey remarked coolly, a satisfied smile crossing his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members were pleased, feeling as though their mission had already borne fruit with the equivalent of a month's pay in hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne accepted his bag with a frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was hard to swallow that these human overseers had just handed over hundreds of thousands of Essence Crystals, which were likely extracted from the sweat and toil of the unfortunate miners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "How many Human Community workers have suffered and been exploited for this bounty?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he was seething inside, Osborne kept his displeasure hidden behind a smile as he tucked the bag away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These overseers are just like Patrick&mdash;despicable!" he thought, casting a disdainful glance at the group, silently condemning them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey, however, was already moving on, his attention shifting to a middle-aged man who seemed to be in charge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chester, give me the lowdown on what's happening in the No. 9 mining area," he ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chester Walton, the overseer, beamed at the opportunity to speak, his face a mask of ingratiation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, Mr. Alick. The trouble began in the E53 sector of the No. 9 mining area. This is a shallow mining zone where over five thousand human miners extract Essence Crystals, producing more than three million Crystals every month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"About two weeks ago, miners in E53 started encountering attacks from Deathborns. We lost over twenty miners, but as you know, with No. 9 being so far from Wild Flame City, losing a few miners didn't seem like a big deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We just sent in more workers. But the deaths kept rising, and we finally realized something was seriously wrong. Just as we were gearing up to clean out the Deathborn from E53, disaster struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least a hundred Superior Deity-class Deathborns appeared simultaneously and slaughtered over a thousand miners! There were even Transcendent Deity Deathborns among them. This kind of Deathborn swarm is beyond what we overseers can handle, so we had no choice but to call in the Wild Flame Army for help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chester's explanation hung heavy in the air, and Jeffrey let out a cold snort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, over a thousand Human Community miners are dead? What kind of oversight is this? Who's going to fill the gap left by those miners? Are you overseers going to step in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes flashed with icy fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chester jumped at Jeffrey's harsh words, momentarily taken aback. However, he quickly regained his composure, rifling through his belongings until he extracted an even larger bag filled with at least 30 thousand Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With an ingratiating nod, he thrust the bag toward Jeffrey. "Mr. Alick, we realize our mistakes. Please forgive us; we promise to make amends," he said, his tone dripping with earnestness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey responded with a cold grin, opening the bag as if casually inspecting the contents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes lit up with interest when he caught sight of the sparkling crystals, and he hastily tucked the bag away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that fleeting moment, Osborne sensed a distinct aura emanating from the bag&mdash;there were several mid-grade Essence Crystals mixed in among the regular ones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but think, "Jeffrey isn't really angry; he's just playing Chester and the others like puppets, squeezing them for more Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Chester seems used to this kind of game."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jeffrey's voice rang out like a warning. "Fine! I'll let you off the hook this time, but don't let it happen again! Now, take us to the E53 sector. We need to deal with that Deathborn swarm, and we still have to get back after that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the words left his mouth, a collective sigh of relief swept through the overseers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For them, as long as they avoided giving the Wild Flame Army a reason to punish, they wouldn't face any serious repercussions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And as for the Essence Crystals? If they had to cough them up, so be it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They figured they'd find a way to exploit the miners again later. If anyone resisted, they'd just eliminate the troublemakers&mdash;fear would keep the rest in line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll lead you to the E53 sector right away," Chester said.</span></p></div>
