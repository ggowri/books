        <h1>Chapter 75 The Third Test</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne continued to explore the new ability of Satan&rsquo;s Eye. He wanted to see if he could control bullets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne chose to use the Draco Model H mini-handgun for testing because this gun was known to have the fastest bullet speed. It was three times faster than ordinary guns.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;If I can catch the bullets from the Draco Model H mini-handgun, other pistols, guns and rifles will no longer be a threat to me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne took a deep breath and pulled the trigger hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The bullet flew out and shot toward the distant target at a speed of nearly 666 feet per second, which was extremely terrifying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The control range of Satan&rsquo;s Eye was only 33 feet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In other words, Osborne must react quickly within 0.05 seconds and use the ocular energy to capture and control the bullet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Other people wouldn&rsquo;t react in 0.05 seconds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Osborne was different. Satan&rsquo;s Eye could slow down the speed of moving objects. Especially after level three, this ability became stronger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this moment, in Osborne&rsquo;s eyes, the bullet with terrifying speed was shooting towards the target in the distance at a slow speed. He had enough time to react and capture.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The bullet had only traveled less than three feet. The ocular energy burst out and covered the bullet. It was fixed steadily in mid-air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I did it&hellip;&rdquo; Osborne was surprised. Using Satan&rsquo;s Eye to catch the bullet actually worked. It was much easier than he had imagined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne felt that as long as there were not more than a dozen guns shooting at him at close range at the same time, he could use Satan&rsquo;s Eye to control all the bullets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This was a huge improvement in his strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His safety would be greatly improved. He could also foresee danger. It would be impossible for anyone to shoot him from behind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was full of confidence in his current strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although Osborne was good before, he was not considered a top master. Osborne was not sure he could deal with Isa, Donna, or even Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguard captain, Paul.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But now, Osborne was no longer afraid of these people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Thinking of Clarissa, Osborne couldn&rsquo;t help but frown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I have completed my second successor test. I don&rsquo;t need to be Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguard anymore. When it&rsquo;s daybreak, I will notify the Radcliffe family that I won&rsquo;t be coming over.&rdquo; Osborne made a decision.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then he thought, &ldquo;I became Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguard for the purpose of completing the successor test. Now that the test is over. I have no interest in being a bodyguard for others. Although Clarissa&rsquo;s status is noble, I am not bad either now. I have more than 600 million dollars in cash in my account. Luna Jewelry is worth billions of dollars. If I reveal my true identity now, I will be considered a big shot in Mayby City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Why would I be Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguard? Just because she is beautiful? Every time I see her, my heart beats faster. And, I admit that Clarissa is indeed wonderful. Not only does she have a powerful background and identity, but she also has terrifying supernatural talents. She is an unprecedented possessor of three supernatural powers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;But being Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguard is too dangerous. I am still frightened by yesterday&rsquo;s attack, especially the metahuman who could control lightning attacks and the dozen or so werewolves. If I stay with Clarissa, I will inevitably face such dangers in the future. I don&rsquo;t want to cause trouble for myself.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne made up his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll contact the Radcliffe family at dawn and tell them that I can&rsquo;t be Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguard anymore.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But at this moment, his Draco Star Wristlet suddenly vibrated. Osborne looked down and was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The message showed, [The third test of succession begins! Within seven days, you will become the captain of Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguards.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; When Osborne saw the requirements of the third successor test, he was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He wondered, <span style="font-style: italic;">Godfather asked me to become Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguard captain within seven days? How is this possible? I have confidence in myself. But the time is too short</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> This is too difficult. The Radcliffe family has no trust in me at all. No matter how strong I am, how can they give me the position of bodyguard captain?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne frowned tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had just decided not to be Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguard. But Godfather gave him a new test. He even suspected that Godfather was monitoring him somewhere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne smiled bitterly, &ldquo;Fortunately, I haven&rsquo;t resigned from the Radcliffe family yet. Otherwise, it would be another trouble.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The new test for the successor was to become the captain of Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguards. Osborne could only accept it because he was not qualified to negotiate terms with Godfather.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Moreover, he had his reasons for having to complete the test.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne began to analyze the success rate of completing the test.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;If I want to become Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguard captain, I must first gain the Radcliffe family&rsquo;s absolute trust. I must also find a way to get rid of the Captain Paul and defeat all competitors. I only have seven days. It&rsquo;s really too difficult.&rdquo;</p></div>
