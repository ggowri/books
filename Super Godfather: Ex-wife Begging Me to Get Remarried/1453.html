        <h1>Chapter 1452 Slave Market</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The slave market was located in the inner city of Wild Flame City, right next to the bustling core area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the sheer size of the city made the prospect of getting there daunting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew that walking to the slave market would take him at least twenty minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that he didn't want to hurry; he simply couldn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Wild Flame City, no matter one's strength, flying was strictly off-limits. To do so would be to tread on the heads of the powerful, provoking their wrath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the elite residing atop the floating mountains dared to take to the skies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For everyone else, the options were limited to driving on the roads or walking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even walking came with its own restrictions; no matter how powerful one was, you had to adhere to the speed limits set by the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne didn't have a vehicle, he had no choice but to take a leisurely stroll to the slave market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe it's time I thought about getting a car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having a divine power vehicle would make moving around Wild Flame City a whole lot easier. Lachlan never bought one because he was too broke&mdash;the cheapest divine power car costs at least 50 thousand Essence Crystals, and even he struggled to scrape that together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Lachlan, spending that much on a car was a waste; it was better spent currying favor with his superiors or on his own training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I'm different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in the No. 9 mining area, I raked in over 50 thousand top-grade Essence Crystals and a staggering 10 million mid-grade ones in just three hours. That's worth more than one and a half billion low-grade Essence Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could easily afford a low-grade divine power vehicle and even a mid-grade one starting at 500 thousand or a top-grade one at five million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could buy a whole fleet if I wanted! So why not invest in a divine power vehicle to make my life easier in this city?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this thought in mind, Osborne felt a spark of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perfect! The slave market is right on Wild Flame Street, the busiest commercial area in the city. There are plenty of shops selling divine power vehicles and other divine artifacts nearby. I'll check them out after I take care of business."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he walked, he soon found himself on a vibrant commercial street bustling with activity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wild Flame Street was massive and wide, teeming with people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to the commercial streets back on Blue Planet, this one was not only larger but also more impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The slave market was located at the very front of this street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne approached, he noticed a throng of elegantly dressed individuals stepping out of their divine power vehicles, making their way into the slave market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear they were there to purchase slaves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight was so commonplace that the passersby hardly blinked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This alone demonstrated how ubiquitous and normalized the slave trade had become in Wild Flame City. It was a matter of course that everyone took for granted as a common aspect of daily life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart sank as he watched a group of human slaves being led out, their hands and feet shackled. They were roughly shoved onto a divine power transport vehicle, treated like cattle, their faces etched with fear and despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The well-dressed patrons looked on, not with pity, but with a mix of mockery and disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clenching his fists tightly, Osborne felt rage boiling inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he quickly quelled it, knowing he wasn't in a position to change anything just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "One day, I'll bring this place to its knees. I'll make sure the slave trade becomes a thing of the past, and those who profit from the suffering of the Human Community will pay dearly for their actions!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination fueling his steps, Osborne entered the slave market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost immediately, a striking middle-aged woman approached him; her face lit up with a bright smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, Mr. Lachlan Swift from the Swift family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's been a while since you last visited our slave market! What brings you here today? Looking to add a few more slaves to your collection?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me show you around; we've got some excellent merchandise in today! Plus, there's a slave auction later&mdash;if you're interested, you might want to check it out! The top-tier slaves will be up for bidding!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged woman beamed, wrapping her arm around Osborne's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne calmly pulled his arm away, his mind racing as he processed the information about this woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian Fairfax, a slave saleswoman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was part of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her family, the Fairfax family, was one of the prominent Human Community factions in Wild Flame City, second only to the Swift family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumor had it that the Fairfax family had cozy ties with the Demonic Dragon Clan, one of the real power players behind the slave market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That explained why Lillian was working here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a wave of disdain wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Here was a member of a prestigious Human Community family, shamelessly peddling and selling her own kind to the various races.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said coldly, his voice steady, "I'm not here to buy slaves. On the contrary, I'm here to help my human slaves regain their freedom and status."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian's smile faltered, and she stared at him, momentarily taken aback.</span></p></div>
