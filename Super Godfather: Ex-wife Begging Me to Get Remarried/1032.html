        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fury boiled over as he shouted, "You damned </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> actually think you can capture me and make me a Human Slave? You wiped out everyone from </span><span>Likreia</span><span> Mountain! I'm going to take you down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A bunch of worthless clones, you all can go to hell!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come at me! I'll wipe the floor with you scum!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an explosive surge of power, Bryce unleashed an attack that engulfed over twenty Class S clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were in the sea now, with water all around them, and Bryce's main discipline was water elemental power, which naturally gave him an edge in this environment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying force from his attack sent the attacking clones staggering back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Some of you, go kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that command, the over twenty Class S clones abandoned their assault on Osborne and charged at Bryce instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce's face paled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Crap, that looks like more than twenty now! Bring it on, I'm not scared!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wild gleam danced in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I can't let you outshine me! There are fifty-one Class S clones in total&mdash;I'll take on twenty-six, and the rest are all yours!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see who's tougher!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he charged into the fray, madness written all over his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Clarkson, well done!" Osborne exclaimed, excitement flooding him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his plan, as long as Bryce could hold off twenty enemies, he would stand a chance against the rest and escaped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with Bryce managing to take on twenty-six, that left Osborne facing just twenty-five!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His confidence surged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Locking eyes with the twenty-five Class S clones, he growled, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you enjoy that? Now it's my turn! You're all going to meet your end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he charged in, twenty-five attacks converged on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that moment, Osborne felt absolutely unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the attackers were ten Medusa Queens, known for their petrifying powers but lacking in brute strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that petrifying power?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn&rsquo;t work on him now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's martial art aura flared, absorbing all of their incoming attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the ensuing attacks eventually broke through, they had lost much of its potency after the aura, barely leaving a mark on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not to mention, Osborne still had the Crystal of Life replenishing his vitality, and he felt his wounds closing fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time to strike!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that battle cry, Osborne jumped into action, donning his </span><span>Thundergod</span><span> Gloves and gripping the Volt Hammer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tremendous burst of electricity crackled as he propelled himself into the thick of the fight, wielding the Volt Hammer like it was just any other hammer, bringing it down hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a sound of thunder, he smashed the head of a Tauren King. The sound resonated with a resounding crack, and Osborne felt a jolt travel up his arm as the immense recoil flung him backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Tauren King let out a tragic wail as it collapsed to the ground, its skull crushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite its formidable defenses and insurmountable tough skin, it was clear that Osborne's power was beyond anything that creature could hope to withstand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing one of them fall, the remaining Class S clones, consumed by rage, unleashed a barrage of attacks toward Osborne, breaking through his martial art aura and inflicting injuries upon him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was futile!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Osborne, he needed at least thirty Class S clones on him to feel any pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, with only twenty-four left to face, it simply wasn't enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die, all of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold smirk, he transformed into a Vampire, drawing upon the blood of the last two Class S Vampire Kings in the crowd and swiftly dispatching them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, with a roar, the Breath of Celestial erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's power surged dramatically!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His strength multiplied again&mdash;at least eight times stronger than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could withstand his onslaught now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his martial art aura as a shield, Osborne barreled through the crowd, swinging the Volt Hammer down with relentless fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each strike was lethal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether it was a Tauren King, a Titan King, or a Wolf King, none could withstand his might; each fell to the ground with a single blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, ten Class S clones had died because of the power of his Volt Hammer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clumsy Titan Kings and Tauren Kings were dead like the Vampire Kings before them, leaving only ten Medusa Queens and five Wolf Kings standing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne moved like a god of war, annihilating them with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining fifteen Class S clones began to tremble, fear creeping into their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Block him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They screamed in frantic desperation, but their attempts were utterly futile. One by one, they fell to Osborne's rampage, slaughtered like prey before the hunter.</span></p></div>
