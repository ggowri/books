        <h1>Chapter 890 The Blood Princess' Turn</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, I swear I'll end you!" Bradley spat, his voice cold as ice and full of hate.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne didn't even glance his way. Instead, he kicked Felicity off the stage like she was nothing. She hit the ground with a sickening thud, coughing up blood and pieces. Only then did Osborne turn to face Bradley.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"End me? Ha! You should worry about getting out of here alive first," Osborne sneered. "Showing up in Rosmandi as Gerardo's lackey? That's either brave or foolish."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he spoke, his eyes glinted with a dangerous edge."Hmph!" Bradley scoffed, unbothered by Osborne's threats, a hint of disdain on his face.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You think you can take our lives? You'd be sorely mistaken! With Godfather absent, the Augustine family is nothing but a bunch of nobodies!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His words ignited fury among the Augustine family members, their eyes blazing with anger as they glared at him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne had just defeated Felicity, surpassing Sebastian's record of 95 consecutive wins, now standing at 96 victories. The fact that he had done it by defeating Gerardo's granddaughter sent waves of excitement through the family members.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They watched Osborne with a mix of admiration and fervor, especially as he had mercilessly taught Felicity a lesson.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, the members of the Augustine family were united in their respect for Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was making history, achieving what even Sebastian hadn't managed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They could almost see a new legend rising, a second Godfather in the making.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How could they not be thrilled?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Bradley's bold words sparked outrage.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Wesson shot a frigid look in Bradley's direction.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmph! Once the Honor Quest Ceremony is over, it'll be your turn to die!" Wesson spat coldly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bradley merely snorted, his indifference palpable.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My death? I think it'll be the end of the Augustine family instead!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, he scooped up Felicity, choosing silence over further provocation.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne frowned, a knot of concern tightening in his gut.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "Bradley is far too calm. He knows the Augustine family and the Aberrants have a long-standing feud; there's no way we'll let him leave unscathed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What's he counting on?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Could it be that the King of the Aberrants is here in person?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His mind raced, but he couldn't dwell on it&mdash;his Honor Quest Ceremony was still underway.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With Felicity's defeat, Osborne's streak had reached 96 wins.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just four more victories stood between him and the elusive 100-win milestone.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That was a monumental achievement!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In over two centuries of the Honor Quest Ceremony, only nine individuals had ever reached 100 consecutive wins. If Osborne could pull it off, he would become the tenth.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It would be his glory, the glory of the Augustine family.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, it was also a mark of shame for all those who had faced Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They were united in their refusal to let him succeed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the next battles approached, Osborne's opponents came out swinging, desperate to drain his energy rather than defeat him outright.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though Osborne was immensely powerful, he had to tread carefully against their frenzied assaults, expending significant strength just to secure victory.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ninety-nine wins!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just one more, and he'd achieve the legendary hundred.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The anticipation among the Augustine family was electric; they were all waiting, praying for the moment of glory to arrive.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, Scarlett slowly rose to her feet with a cold smile.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's next challenger was her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa's expression darkened instantly as she watched Scarlett. Just five days ago, Scarlett had effortlessly defeated her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa knew all too well just how powerful Scarlett truly was.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A look of deep worry crossed Clarissa's face. She quickly spoke up, "Osborne, you need to be careful! She's really powerful. Just five days ago, she took me down without breaking a sweat. I barely had any chance to fight back!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At her words, Osborne's expression hardened.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "Scarlett was able to defeat Clarissa so easily?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Clarissa was just an AA Class fighter, her strength was formidable&mdash;she wielded the Fate Staff, which gave her an edge against even the likes of Emma.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was a reason she didn't rank merely at 300 on the Godson Rankings; her true capabilities were far greater.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And for Scarlett to handle her with such ease?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even considering that Clarissa had fought over ten consecutive matches and was drained, it was clear that Scarlett posed a serious threat.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Slowly, Scarlett made her way onto the stage with a smirk.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Bad timing for you! Your 100th match just had to be against me! Looks like your Honor Quest Ceremony is about to hit a wall. No 100 wins for you!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne felt his guard go up, but he kept his cool. "Scarlett? You're only number 100 on the Godson Rankings, and you think that's something to brag about? Besides, you're an assassin from Eityreia. You might be hot stuff in the wild, but in the arena? Not so much!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Scarlett let out a laugh, clearly amused.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm only at 100 because I haven't bothered to climb higher. Trust me, if I wanted to, I could easily crack the top twenty!"</p></div>
