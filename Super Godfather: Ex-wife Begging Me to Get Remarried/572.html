        <h1>Chapter 572 You Can't Win</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The room fell into a tense silence as everyone felt the palpable rage emanating from Osborne. They all clamped their mouths shut.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's brow furrowed deeply as he spoke with chilling coldness, "Not a word? Do you expect me to uncover this on my own? Or do you believe that my sister's assault is a matter to be swept under the rug?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yulissa was not Osborne's biological sister.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, during this time, Osborne had assumed the role of her brother, sharing meals and living quarters with her. How could he not develop feelings for her? He had grown accustomed to this identity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Yulissa battered and bruised, how could Osborne remain calm?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What infuriated him the most was the apparent reluctance of everyone to involve him in this matter, hoping it would simply fade away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne knew there was only one reason for this: the person who had assaulted Yulissa held a formidable identity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other members from Dampston could not afford to provoke this individual and were forced to endure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Others might endure, but Osborne would not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had endured enough!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During his three-year living under the roof of the wealthy Caldwell family, he had borne every humiliation and contempt from them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What was the outcome?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What had his forbearance earned him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It had earned him even greater disdain from the Caldwell family, who treated him as less than human. It had earned him a divorce from his wife, Ophelia, who had cast him aside, leaving him with nothing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From that moment on, Osborne had made his decision: he would never endure again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why had he worked so hard to better himself and complete the test to become the Godfather's successor? Was it truly to ascend to the role of the new Godfather?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He merely sought to cease being bullied and humiliated. When faced with such treatment, he wanted the freedom to swing his fists and unleash his fury!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne knew that Yulissa's assault must be linked to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His brilliance during the Branch Bloodline Competition had undoubtedly offended many, leading to Yulissa's involvement and subsequent beating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In this situation, how could Osborne turn a blind eye?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he ignored such injustices, what was the point of his existence?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tell me, who did it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne demanded sternly, "If you withhold the truth, I will leave here immediately! From this moment on, we go our separate ways!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, everyone turned pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, don't be rash."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nathan urged with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne shot a fierce gaze at him. "Nathan, you tell me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With gritted teeth, Nathan nodded vigorously. His eyes flashed with anger. "Alright! I'll tell you!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, it was Owen who did it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We were all at the Challenge Peak watching the live broadcast of the Branch Bloodline Competition. At that time, you killed David, but no one knew it. Everyone thought it was you who was killed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The people from Ransford were very haughty and said that you had no strength and deserved to die. Owen also stood up and said that if you die, we could not hold them responsible for your death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Later, they found out that the person who died was not you but David. They were furious and wanted to retaliate against us.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As a result, Owen actually favored the branch bloodline from Ransford at this time and insisted that this was a matter between our branches. He meant he had no right to interfere. This meant that the members from Ransford could retaliate against us at will.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yulissa felt that he was biased towards Ransford branch, so she said something to him. As a result, it was this sentence that angered Owen, and he directly attacked her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Owen is too formidable, so we are utterly powerless against him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Isaac was also injured during the resistance, but in the end, we could only watch as Owen slapped Yulissa with a resounding slap. Owen also threatened that if Yulissa dared to speak out of turn again, he would employ the right as the heir-to-be of the Augustine family to confine her to the dungeons.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, it's all our fault."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nathan looked aggrieved after telling the story.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's eyes, ablaze with a fiery rage, settled on the crimson imprint that marred Yulissa's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Owen Augustine?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ransford?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Very well!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne gritted his teeth and said, "I will not let it go. He must pay the price for hitting my sister!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a promise of retribution, Osborne turned and made for the exit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, where are you headed?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Panic ensued as others rushed to halt his advance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His reply was as cold as steel. "To settle a score. An eye for an eye. Though Owen stands as the heir apparent, I am also a contender now. His assault on Yulissa will not go unanswered. I will challenge him now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I will confront him at Challenge Peak!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isaac shouted, "Osborne, you must not let your emotions guide you! Owen's strength is beyond that of David or Sam. You must maintain your composure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I understand your anger, but do not let it blind you. To face Owen now would be folly! You can't win!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can't win?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne murmured and recalled his past encounters with Owen, where victory had eluded him. If Caleb failed to intervene in time, Osborne might have been defeated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even with his strength elevated from Class A to Class A+, Osborne was still unsure if he could match Owen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen, after all, was one of the four prospective heirs of the main bloodline.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen's strength was widely acknowledged to be formidable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, could Osborne truly stand down, knowing that formidable Owen had harmed Yulissa?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Absolutely not!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's cold voice sliced through the silence. "Victory may be uncertain, but this fight is inevitable."</p></div>
