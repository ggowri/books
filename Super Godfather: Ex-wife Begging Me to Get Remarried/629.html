        <h1>Chapter 629 Time Is Distorted</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It hadn't been long since Osborne broke through to Class A+, if he calculated it seriously. He never expected to progress further so quickly and achieve the breakthrough to Class AA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason why it was so fast was because Osborne absorbed a large amount of star power during this period of time. The speed at which he absorbed star power was dozens or even hundreds of times faster than anyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under such circumstances, it was normal for him to quickly break through to Class AA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The transition from Class A+ to Class AA was indeed a significant threshold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Except for him, all the potential heirs of the Augustine family were at least Class AA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elders of the main bloodline of the Augustine family were at least Class AA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even those Godsons abroad were at least Class AA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was already unexpected for Osborne to become the designated successor of the Augustine family at Class A+. And now, he had finally caught up in terms of his realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the breakthrough was completed, and his realm was stabilized at Class AA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was delighted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather had not left yet. He looked at Osborne in surprise and said, "It seems that you have perfectly inherited Vivienne's talent. You are one of the fastest individuals I have seen in terms of power progression. Perhaps, what I couldn't accomplish, you truly can."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne heard this and said calmly, "I will definitely do it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he thought of another question and asked, "Regarding the Augustine family's inherited power, the Satan's Eye, is it true that no one has found a way to break through level seven yet? Even you, the Godfather, are still only at level six?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, the Godfather nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right. Even my Satan's Eye is only at level six. I have studied it for decades and used various methods, but I still can't find a way to break through to level seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, what is certain is that the Satan's Eye can break through to level seven. The key to the breakthrough lies in the star power. By absorbing a large amount of star power and reaching a certain limit, there will be a chance to break through level seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And I am sure that level seven of the Satan's Eye is related to time powers! Once the Satan's Eye breaks through level seven, it can control the most bizarre time powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The reason why no one can break through the level seven is because the flow rate of time in our world is a little bit wrong. Maybe when the flow rate of time returns to normal, we can break through it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Godfather finished speaking, Osborne looked surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In order to make the Satan's Eye break through the level seven, do we need to absorb a substantial amount of star power? But is there an issue with the flow of time in our world? Does that mean we temporarily cannot achieve the breakthrough?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was a little confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there an issue with the flow of time? What does that mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather looked solemn and explained, "This is a huge secret! If you use the best astronomical telescope to observe the planets outside the solar system, you will find that the speed of time on those planets is much slower than ours!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The time of the entire solar system has been distorted. The speed of time is hundreds </span><span>or even thousands of times faster than that of other galaxies!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One year has passed in other galaxies, but thousands of years have passed in our planet! It's just that we have lived here since we were born, so we can't feel the anomaly of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is already an open secret in the world's high-level circles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, the degree of time distortion in the solar system is rapidly diminishing. Perhaps in a short while, the flow of time in the solar system will return to normal. By then, it is possible that we can all elevate the Satan's Eye to the level seven."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather finished speaking, and Osborne was completely stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was the time in the solar system distorted? </span><span>Was</span><span> the time flowing hundreds or thousands of times faster than in other galaxies?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His first thought was not to believe it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he soon thought of the mythological story that Isa had told him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the story about the God of Time in the Court of the Sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne tried hard to recall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa told him that a long, long time ago, there were many gods in the world. They started wars everywhere in order to compete for believers, which eventually angered the God of Night in the Court of the Sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Night turned the entire world into darkness in a rage, killing almost all the gods and even all living beings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the God of Time met her demise, she activated her abilities and traveled back to before her death. She witnessed the world in ruins but lacked the power to restore it to its former state. So, she chose another path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Time consumed all her strength and her life to speed up the time of the entire solar system by billions of times! She used billions of times to resolve the traces of the war of gods, to allow this world to breed intelligent life again, and for gods to reappear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had a dazed look on his face at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mythological story that Isa had told him actually echoed what the Godfather was saying now, that the time of the solar system was distorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that what Isa told me was not a myth but something that really happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He became extremely solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa once mentioned that the time acceleration in the solar system has not ceased until recently as she suddenly felt the reawakening of the God of Time's abilities. Once she fully awakens, the flow of time in the solar system will return to normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa also said that the world by then will be completely different from what it is now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She said the gods will appear again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and recalled her abnormality in his mind. Suddenly, he felt that this might not be a myth made up by Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps she really did come across references to this in some ancient scriptures.</span></p></div>
