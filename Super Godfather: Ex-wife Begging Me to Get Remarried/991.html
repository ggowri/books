        <h1>Chapter 991 Devil's Light Breakthrough</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne gazed out at the dark night through the car window, a weighty seriousness settled over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization was a force to be reckoned with&mdash;the world's top assassin group, renowned for their strength and professionalism. Despite having easily dispatched over fifty of their operatives, including two Class S assassins, he dared not underestimate them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To think lightly of the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization was a surefire way to get himself killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew he would need at least six or seven hours to relocate all the Lambert family members to the Augustine Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That felt like an eternity, especially considering the inevitable obstacles they would face along the way. The assassins of the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization wouldn't simply let the Lambert family slip away unchallenged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Sin and Crimson&mdash;two of their most elite Class S killers&mdash;might be on their way, seeking vengeance for their daughter, Scarlett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although both were injured, they were still far beyond what Osborne could handle alone at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to make some preparations," Osborne muttered to himself, following an impulse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tapped into his Draco Star Wristlet to contact First, the captain of the Blood Demon's First Combat Battalion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon comprised ten battalions, with Osborne and Clarissa as its leaders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time was tight for both, leaving First to manage the operation largely on his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A brief conversation unfolded, and when they hung up, Osborne felt a significant weight lift from his shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had ordered First to bring two battalions of Blood Demon warriors, arriving by helicopter&mdash;a promise of support within the hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's hope nothing goes sideways in that time," Osborne said quietly as he began to sift through his haul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having taken out over fifty assassins from the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization was no small feat, and he had reaped substantial rewards from it. From the two Class S assassins alone, he'd collected four divine artifact daggers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though categorized as Ordinary divine artifacts, their value was undeniable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Maybe I could form an elite special task force within the Blood Demon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Select the strongest warriors, arm them with divine artifacts I can't use, and equip them with top-notch gear. That would elevate our combat effectiveness dramatically."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his power grew steadily, so too did the caliber of his adversaries. They had become formidable, even reaching the Class S tier, many of them wielding divine artifacts. Yet, despite capturing these artifacts, Osborne found himself unable to utilize them, relegating them to the Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A divine artifact left unused was a waste, a squandered resource. Instead, Osborne mused, why not assemble a crack special forces unit? A vanguard for the Blood Demon, trained in assassination, sniping, reconnaissance behind enemy lines, and hit-and-run tactics. This elite squad could wield the divine artifacts, turning them into formidable weapons that would undoubtedly strengthen the Blood Demon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With resolute determination, Osborne made up his mind: upon his return, he would begin assembling </span><span>this special forces</span><span> unit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The numbers wouldn't need to be overwhelming&mdash;fifty to a hundred operatives would suffice. Equip them all with divine artifacts and super energy pistols, and the potency of such a team would be downright terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a clear vision forming in his mind, he carefully tucked away the four daggers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, he retrieved a whip, a trophy from Scarlett's lifeless body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whip was a divine artifact, stretching about 33 feet. Crafted from some unknown amalgamation of materials that resembled both metal and leather, it exuded an aura of tremendous power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne recognized the whip's potential; it was undoubtedly a potent divine artifact&mdash;at least top-grade, if not something even rarer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, perplexingly, he found himself unable to harness its vast energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how hard he tried, the whip remained dormant in his hands, its power frustratingly out of reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "No wonder Scarlett didn't use this divine artifact whip against me. She probably couldn't wield it yet! This whip was likely a gift from her parents, something she was meant to 'cultivate' within herself for later use.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now it's mine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a satisfied grin, he stored the whip away in his Dimensional Space, planning to revisit it when his own strength had grown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Osborne focused on the new surge of energy coursing through him&mdash;the plant elemental essence he had just absorbed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarlett had specialized in plant elemental power, a unique ability that allowed her to manipulate trees, vines, and all manner of flora, turning them into weapons for her battles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While her attacks might not have been devastating, they were certainly tricky to deal with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was the </span><span>first person</span><span> Osborne had encountered who had mastered plant elemental power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that she was gone, he had made sure to consume her essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarlett was one of the most gifted prodigies of her generation; her plant elemental essence was incredibly potent, and now it was his for the taking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "This is it&mdash;my tenth elemental essence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once I integrate this, my Devil's Light will jump from Level Eight to Level Nine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could hardly contain his anticipation. A Level Nine Devil's Light, combined with his martial art aura, would surely amplify his abilities beyond anything he'd experienced so far.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's hope this doesn't let me down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took another deep breath, channeling the newly acquired plant elemental essence into his Devil's Light. He had gone through this transformation eight times before, and with his enhanced strength, he felt confident he could handle it without a hitch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, the energy within him surged, and he could feel the breakthrough occurring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level Nine Devil's Light!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The newly upgraded Devil's Light radiated a faint black sheen, pulsating with a power that sent shivers down his spine.</span></p></div>
