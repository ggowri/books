        <h1>Chapter 108 Save Barlyn</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gunshot came so suddenly that Barlyn was caught completely off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned his head quickly, only to see the bullet speeding toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, time seemed to freeze; he felt paralyzed, the chill of imminent death enveloping him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As an elemental metahuman, Barlyn would have had countless ways to protect himself from a regular bullet if he had been prepared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he was helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, "Am I going to die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, regret washed over him like a tidal wave. Barlyn regretted letting his guard down just because the attacker was a child, and he regretted being so careless despite knowing the enemy was a gang member.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was too late for regrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time resumed its course, and the bullet continued its deadly path. There was no escaping it, and his frail body was no match for the projectile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, a cold voice cut through the tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, the bullet came to a halt right in front of Barlyn, suspended in mid-air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Osborne who had intervened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne emerged from the villa, his gaze fixed on the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn, drenched in sweat and breathing heavily, turned toward Osborne with a look of sheer relief and gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "Barlyn, you really need to be more careful. If I hadn't been keeping an eye on things, you'd be a goner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'd look pretty pathetic if you got killed by a kid."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn managed a wry smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, enough. I get it. I didn't expect a seven or eight-year-old to be a Maelstrom member."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then glared at the child who had shot at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The kid, now bound by Osborne's ocular energy, was trembling in fear. He struggled desperately, trying to lift the gun and continue shooting, but it was futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's power could lift up to 2200 pounds. There was no way a child could break free from such control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn kid, mixed up with a gang at your age? Does your mother know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fuming, Barlyn kicked the child away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He conjured a sharp stone spire with his powers and held it to the kid's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The child's eyes were wide with terror, tears streaming down his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Barlyn could have easily ended the child's life, but he hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching the tears and the pleading look on the child's face, he was filled with turmoil and indecision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't bring myself to hurt a child. Get lost and don't show your face around here again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a final shove, Barlyn dismissed the stone spire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave Barlyn a thoughtful glance but said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wouldn't have been able to kill a child either, despite the gang affiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Barlyn had decided to kill the kid, Osborne wouldn't have stopped him, given the threat the child posed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But since Barlyn chose not to, Osborne wasn't going to either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using his ocular energy, Osborne flung the child far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everything's been cleared out. Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly jumped into the truck, started the engine, and sped away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as they left, a convoy of vehicles roared towards the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Davy, emerging from a luxury car, stormed into the now-empty vault, his furious roar echoing through the empty space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who did this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who dared to steal my money?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't care who you are - I'll hunt you down and make you pay!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahhh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a frenzy, Davy and his crew scrambled to chase after them, but the culprits were long gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, on the truck, Barlyn had finally pulled himself out from the impact of the brink of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you saved my life. I owe you one. If you ever need anything, just let me know. I'll do whatever it takes to help you out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn's voice was heavy with sincerity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a calm, reassuring smile. "It's not as dramatic as you're making it out to be. After all, I brought you into this mess. If something had happened to you, I wouldn't have felt right. It was only natural for me to step in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still, I owe you a life," Barlyn insisted, his gaze unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't argue further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was already mulling over how to transform this truckload of cash and valuables into something legitimate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the dubious origins of the money, it couldn't simply be deposited into a bank account.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had to be cleaned first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn said decisively. "Osborne, leave this to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know someone who can handle this - a top heir from Mayby City. If we give her these assets, she'll sort it out for us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn quickly made the necessary calls. Before long, the truck rolled into a warehouse by the docks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, a striking young woman awaited their arrival.</span></p></div>
