Would they really be worry-free?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would only lead to more bloodshed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their situation wouldn't necessarily improve if they ran.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for preserving their bloodlines?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The major Ancient Families and superpowers had already discreetly sent their promising younger generations away. That was a non-issue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, the only option left was to stand and fight the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they won, everything would be fine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They would still be the Ancient Families and superpowers of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>. If they lost, then they could think about escaping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, a fierce determination ignited in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson declared, sensing the shift in mood, "Looks like everyone's on the same page now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're all in this together. If we don't want to end up like rootless animals, we have no choice but to face the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rest assured, the Augustine family will not retreat or beg for mercy! We'll fight the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> to the bitter end! But let's be real; the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> are much stronger now than they were decades ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To be frank, the Augustine family alone can't hold them back! That's why we need your help! Together, we might just have a shot at driving the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> out of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> once and for all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can't let these brutal, bloodthirsty </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> take control!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Wesson's words, the fire in their hearts blazed even brighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wesson Augustine, just tell us what you need us to do! At this point, it's all or nothing!" someone shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely! Whatever you say, we're in!" another voice chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Right now, we need to prepare for battle! The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> is advancing fast, and we must gather everyone who can fight!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All Class A and above fighters need to be ready! Everyone, count how many Class A and above fighters you can muster!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When the time comes, act in unison!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd exchanged glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One person stepped forward first. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! We need to act as one; otherwise, the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> will pick us off one by one! I'll start with my family. The Powell family from Newport City has 76 fighters who are Class A and above, including nine Class AA and one Class AAA."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Lambert family has 67 Class A and above fighters, with seven Class AA and two Class AAA."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And the Paltrow family..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The representatives of over a hundred Ancient Families and a dozen superpowers began to report their numbers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the tallies were in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson's expression grew serious as he scanned the results.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've got 38 Class S fighters!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"520 Class AAA!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Over 4,000 Class AA!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And more than 30,000 Class A!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the warriors from the Ancient Families and superpowers were gathered here, a formidable force indeed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But despite the impressive numbers, the mood was somber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson and the leaders of the various factions exchanged worried glances. The truth </span><span>was glaring&mdash;they were still vastly outmatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the information they had got, the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> was estimated to have over 500 Class S clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"500," Wesson muttered under his breath, the weight of the situation pressing down on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the Class S clones were somewhat weaker than their genuine Class S counterparts, they were still a formidable force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And what did they have on their side?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mere 38 Class S fighters!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Including Class S members from the Augustine family and the Draco Group, they barely reached fifty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disparity in numbers was huge&mdash;ten times the difference!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone understood that the outcome of the war depended on the fight between Class S warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere was thick with tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson's calm voice cut through the unease. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't panic, everyone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We hold the advantage of terrain! This is the Augustine family's territory, and we've fortified it for centuries. It won't be easy for anyone to breach our defenses!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, we have the Godfather's scepter on our side!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This battle won't be easy, but if we act together, we'll have a fighting chance!

Each consisted of over 10,000 members, including around 10 Class S fighters, more than 100 Class AAA, and over 1,000 Class AA warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each group was assigned to defend a specific direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as they were finalizing their preparations, the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' army arrived.</span></p><div class="pagination">
