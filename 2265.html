  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson's expression soured as he processed Osborne's shocking words.</span><br><span>Did Osborne really just say he wants to buy me out in front of millions of spectators? Ten thousand Sacred Crystals? What a low blow!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He scoffed loudly. "Shameless! I've told you before, that you can try to buy anyone else, but you'll never buy me. A measly ten thousand Sacred Crystals? You think I'm that easy?" His disdain was evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, continued to smile, unfazed. "Oh, not enough for you? No problem! How about I bump it up to a hundred thousand Sacred Crystals? All you have to do is play along a bit and let me win, and that fortune is yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson's demeanor shifted, his fists tightening. His heart raced as he calculated the offer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hundred thousand Sacred Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was a small fortune&mdash;enough to buy ten quasi-Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was more than everything he had combined!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But looking at Osborne's smug grin, he knew this was just a game. With all these spectators watching, there was no way he could accept.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fury flared within him. "You're asking for trouble! I told </span><span>you,</span><span> you can't buy me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's smile never wavered. "Still not enough? No sweat. I can keep upping the ante! But I get it, you're too shy to say yes in front of all these people. Let's have a little telepathic chat. I've got more than enough Sacred Crystals to spare. I'm dead-set on buying you over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson's face darkened even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at this point, Tyson couldn't help but imagine what Osborne might offer next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Two hundred thousand?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Three hundred thousand?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">A million?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart raced even faster at the thought. If it really came down to a million, maybe he could play along and let Osborne win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was a mind-blowing sum!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even for a power like Azure Haven Academy or Fantasia Isle, a million Sacred Crystals was a monumental amount&mdash;enough to buy a real Sacred Artifact!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he waited for Osborne's next move, he felt his anticipation turn to irritation when no offer came.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne simply grinned back at him. "Great! It's settled then! Just be sure to act well; if you don't put on a good show, I'll definitely hold back on the payment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne hoisted up his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson's eyes popped wide open, and he was seething with anger. "What the hell are you on about? We've reached no agreement at all! I'm not falling for your little scheme!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, sure! No deal here, and we definitely don't want anyone getting a whiff of our 'chat'," Osborne said, his tone way too laid-back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, he let go of the string on his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bolt of Sacred Power whooshed through the air, heading straight for Tyson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what the heck?!" Tyson's heart sank when he saw it. There was no time for arguing. His survival instincts kicked in, and he tightened his grip on his fire spear, swinging it down to block the incoming bolt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Smash it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson was convinced that his brute strength could effortlessly shatter the arrow. He relished head-on confrontations and wasn't daunted by Osborne's attack; he was fully prepared for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in the blink of an eye, a rude awakening hit him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power behind Osborne's Sacred Power arrow was magnitudes greater than he'd ever imagined. When his spear clashed with the arrow, instead of smashing it to pieces, a massive rebound jolted through his body. A searing pain shot through his palm as he fought desperately to keep hold of his spear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his horror, Tyson saw the arrow still hurtling straight towards his chest, completely unstoppable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson's face paled in an instant as a surge of power washed over him. He whipped his blazing spear around once more, desperately trying to fend off Osborne's relentless assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as he was about to counterattack, Osborne let out a cold laugh and released his hold on the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, three Sacred Power arrows shot out in rapid succession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrows pierced through Tyson's defenses like they were made of paper, sending his fiery spear flying through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact hit him like a freight train, knocking him off-balance and sending him staggering backward. The arrows tore through his shoulder, and with a final force, he was launched off the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson crashed to the ground, utterly defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne lowered his bow and looked at Tyson's battered body with a smug smile. "Good work! You put on a pretty good show, though it was a bit too flashy. I'd give you 99 out of 100, but I had to take a point off to keep you from getting too full of yourself! Don't forget to come to me for your payment!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There </span><span>isn</span><span>'t no one in this world who can't be swayed. It's always just a matter of the right price!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a chuckle and shook his head as he stepped off the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Down below, the crowd erupted into an uproar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their voices clashed like the crashing waves against the shore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Osborne is so cocky! He actually tried to buy Tyson right in front of our eyes! And Tyson played along&mdash;he deliberately threw the match!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How many Sacred Crystals did he offer Tyson?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two hundred thousand? Three hundred thousand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unbelievable! Tyson, the guy who always talked about integrity, just sold himself out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Disgraceful! He's even more despicable than Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Referee! </span><span>It's</span><span> crystal clear they're rigging the match! Are you just going to stand there and do nothing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The audience was seething with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The majority were convinced that Tyson didn't lose because Osborne was more powerful, but because he'd been bribed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Tyson was the runner-up in the previous city duel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how strong Osborne was, how could he take Tyson down with just several arrows?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It smelled fishy, like a well-orchestrated farce!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The referee boomed, his voice echoing throughout the arena, "Quiet! Everyone, settle down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll look into any claims of match-fixing. If it's found to be true, we'll invalidate the results! Alright, let the battle rage on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After his declaration, the audience's anger subsided a bit, but their looks of disdain for Osborne remained. They stared daggers at him, hurling insults and scathing criticism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, though, couldn't have cared less.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, he reveled in the turmoil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Everyone thinks I bribed Clara, huh? Well, I'll play along! Let them believe I managed to beat Tyson by underhand means.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've got no reason to feel guilty. Let them yell their lungs out.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, a few spectators were watching Osborne intently, their faces solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew that Tyson hadn't lost because of a bribe; it was the overwhelming might of Osborne's Sacred Power arrows that had brought him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them were Clara and Leroy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, that's a real force to be reckoned with!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy's eyes were alight with excitement. Her fingers drummed lightly on the air, as if she was itching to step into the ring and take on Osborne herself. She could barely hold back her eagerness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sadly, it wasn't their turn just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the tournament rolled on, Osborne faced no real challenges. He breezed through three consecutive victories with ease. By the end of the first day of the Top 16 matches, he remained undefeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the other competitors, only three of them were still on a perfect streak&mdash;Leroy, Marreese, and Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The audience showed complete respect for Leroy and Marreese, acknowledging their strength as legitimate and well-earned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne's undefeated record sparked anger and distrust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Total nonsense! He bought his victories! Look how he took down Tyson!" The grumbling grew louder, echoing doubts throughout the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet nothing anyone said could alter the outcomes already etched into memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second day of battles began swiftly.</span></p><div class="pagination">
