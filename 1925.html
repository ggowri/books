  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cowering rodent, let's see how you handle my Divine Ascendance Technique!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terry unleashed his full power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that mere defense wouldn't save him now; his only hope was to take Osborne down. If he could manage that, the Shadow Drakes rushing toward him would vanish in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Survival relied on this desperate gamble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a roar, he invoked his Divine Ascendance Technique&mdash;Meteorite Cataclysm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne immediately felt a colossal weight press down on him, making his body feel like it was encased in lead. He looked up to see what resembled giant meteors hurtling toward him at breakneck speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine Ascendance Technique!" he muttered, a hint of concern creeping into his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He snorted derisively and tried to dodge, but to his astonishment, the falling masses tracked his movements, adjusting their trajectory to ensure they wouldn't miss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crushing pressure made it increasingly difficult for him to evade the attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he were anyone else, the only option would be to either defend himself or launch a powerful counter to shatter the falling meteors&mdash;though doing so would drain a significant amount of his energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Osborne merely smirked, contempt etched across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impressive technique, but it's nowhere near enough to harm me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had used interdimensional travel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Osborne reappeared behind Terry and Jasper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The meteors, sensing the shift in his location, attempted to change direction, but they were already too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They crashed down, creating a series of thunderous explosions that shook the entire divine peak, leaving massive craters in their wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But all of it&mdash;every last meteor&mdash;landed harmlessly, causing no harm to Osborne whatsoever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terry was momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Divine Ascendance Technique had completely missed its mark! Not only had it failed to scratch Osborne, but it hadn't even drained his energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the realization of the imminent threat from behind hit him, he spun around, feeling a shudder of dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial power?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you the leader of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings&mdash;Theodore? No way! Theodore hasn't even reached the highest Deity King Level. How can he be this powerful?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell are you?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's cold laugh echoed, "You're talking too much! It's time for you to hit the road! Time to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift, viral motion, Osborne launched a powerful punch towards Terry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That punch wasn't a Divine Ascendance Technique, but it packed a tremendous punch nonetheless. At this point, with Terry already on his last legs, he simply couldn't withstand the impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Terry and Jasper were sent careening through the air, crashing heavily to the ground, blood spraying from their mouths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before they could even gather their wits, a horde of Shadow Drakes descended upon them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their screams rang out, piercing the air as the ferocious Shadow Drakes overwhelmed them, mercilessly tearing into their Divine Bodies, causing them to collapse in rapid succession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" Terry tried to muster some defense, but it was futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The relentless barrage of Shadow Drakes hammered his body, and soon, all sound ceased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terry and Jasper&mdash;the two Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings&mdash;were dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a tense knot in his chest loosen at the moment of their demise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle had appeared easy, but he alone understood how challenging it had truly been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it hadn't been for his mastery of Soul Spark Oblivion, his formidable soul power, and the sneak attack that had left Jasper severely wounded, victory might not have been his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally finished! It seems I really do have the power to take on an Ascension One Supernal Deity King. But to defeat one effortlessly? I still have a long way to go. Now, it's time to reap the rewards!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze drifted towards the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thousands of warriors from various clans gaped in horror, witnessing the fall of their two Supernal Deity King leaders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear kicked in, and without a second thought, they turned to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted derisively, "Think you can escape? Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, throngs of Shadow Drakes surged towards the fleeing warriors. Among them, the strongest were merely at the highest Deity King Level. While Osborne's Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes had a slight speed disadvantage against someone like Terry, that weakness didn't even register when facing this crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed of the Shadow Drakes easily surpassed theirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Screams erupted as the Shadow Drakes tore through the mass of warriors. Each collision resulted in the horrific destruction of a Divine Body; these warriors fell as if they were nothing more than twigs snapped underfoot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The devastation unleashed by the Shadow Drakes was so ruthless that even the white Miracle Elixir couldn't heal the carnage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wails and cries lasted only a few seconds, falling into an eerie silence as thousands of warriors were obliterated by the Shadow Drakes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Osborne turned his attention to the sapling nearby.</span></p><div class="pagination">
