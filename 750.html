  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained calm in the face of Stuart's fiery assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew it was the Intermediate Level skill of fire elemental power, Dragon's Breath!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fire elemental power was immensely powerful, and the destructive force of Dragon's Breath was especially terrifying. An average Class AA metahuman facing such an attack would likely be defeated in an instant, consumed by the flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne was no ordinary Class AA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had studied the Lambert family's information and knew their signature power was fire elemental. After all, Pelycosaur Mountain, where the Lambert family resided, was a volcano.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To strengthen themselves, the Lambert family members would venture deep into the volcano to confront and tame the flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, Osborne had long prepared for Stuart's fiery onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't dodge. Instead, he raised his wrist, aiming his super energy pistol at Stuart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly infused energy into the gun. The Divine Bone Crystal within it activated, compressing its energy into a single divine power bullet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Dragon's Breath was about to hit him, Osborne pulled the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a soft pop, the divine power bullet shot out at lightning speed. It carried immense power, easily piercing through Dragon's Breath and heading straight for Stuart's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stuart's face changed dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared in disbelief at the divine power bullet. He hadn't expected that this seemingly insignificant bullet could so easily shatter his Dragon's Breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The divine power bullet, carrying a tremendous force, raced towards his chest, and for the first time, he felt an overwhelming sense of danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Flame!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lava Shield!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stuart didn't dare be careless; he immediately went all out on the defensive. A thick layer of molten lava formed in front of him, creating a Lava Shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, the divine power bullet collided with the Lava Shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deafening explosion followed as the Lava Shield shattered, sending magma flying everywhere. Although the divine power bullet's force was somewhat diminished, it still struck Stuart squarely in the chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a loud boom, the divine power bullet exploded. The massive impact sent Stuart flying several thousand feet. He crashed heavily to the ground, unable to get up for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene left Rhett and Fidelia utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stared in disbelief at the fallen Stuart and then turned their eyes to Osborne, their gazes fixed on the super energy pistol in his hand, filled with astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this a divine artifact?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rhett muttered with a frown, "No, divine artifacts don't look like this. But this is clearly a product of modern technology. How can it possess such power?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An attack like that would be nearly impossible for a typical Class AAA to withstand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rhett's expression was serious, though he showed no fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed he could handle such an attack, but he was intensely curious about the super energy pistol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly and put away the pistol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rhett, this isn't a divine artifact; it's just a special gun. Unfortunately, it's extremely rare, and there's currently only this one, so I can't give it to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rhett shook his head after hearing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's alright; I was just curious. Axell, it's surprising to see you with such a powerful weapon. However, relying on external objects is not the true path. Elevating your own strength and Class is what matters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, Rhett didn't approve of Osborne's way of winning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, Osborne's victory was only due to an external object; his true power was likely inferior to Stuart's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't mind; he simply smiled and said, "Thank you for the advice. I understand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rhett smiled back and said, "Axell, don't take my words the wrong way. At the Honor Quest Ceremony, you can only rely on your own abilities. Any divine artifacts, ancient magic weapons, or energy weapons are forbidden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You better keep pushing forward. I look forward to seeing you reach Class AAA."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Rhett turned to Stuart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, Stuart had finally managed to stand up, though his face was grim. Because Osborne had controlled his power, Stuart's injuries weren't severe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, the psychological blow was enormous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth and said, "Axell, I don't accept this! You won because of a powerful weapon! Why don't we have a real fight, following the Honor Quest Ceremony rules, without using any external objects?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied with a faint smile, "Sorry, I'm not interested. This isn't the Honor Quest Ceremony, and besides, you've already lost."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stuart clenched his fists, his face full of defiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough! It's about time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aleena interrupted them. "Stuart, a loss is a loss! External objects are part of one's strength. All the Class S warriors on the global Quasi-Divine Rankings have their own divine artifacts. Do you think they rely on external objects, too?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, stop arguing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need to get going!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you truly want a battle, save it for the Honor Quest Ceremony and challenge someone there!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
