  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched Brad leave and immediately wanted to catch up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop." Isaac frowned, "Osborne, where are you going?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment and looked at the people around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac waved his hand and told everyone to leave. Everyone left without hesitation. "Now can you tell me what you want to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said calmly, "I want to kill someone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill someone? Who do you want to kill?" Isaac asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to kill Brad," Osborne replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac was shocked. "Are you crazy? You actually want to kill him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why not?" Osborne still looked calm. "Brad has come to the Augustine Estate to show off his power. Why can't I kill him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac was speechless. "He is from the Paltrow family. Do you think I don't want to kill him? But I can't. Besides, can you kill him with your strength?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged. "I don't know, but I can try. I just fought with him twice. I feel that a Class A martial master is not that scary. If he didn't hide his strength, I have at least a 60% chance of killing him. I don't care whether he's a member of the Paltrow family or not. Do you think there is still room for reconciliation between me and the Paltrow family? If I don't kill Brad, will the Paltrow family leave me alone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was shocked at Osborne's confidence and boldness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac frowned tightly and was speechless for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, "This is a personal grudge between me and the Paltrow family. You should know that my girlfriend Clarissa is now forced to marry Alexander. Therefore, </span><span>there is no way that the Paltrow family and I can get along. This is my own business. I will kill Brad myself and will not implicate the Augustine family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Osborne prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop," Isaac called Osborne again and said angrily, "Osborne, what are you talking about? What do you mean this is a matter between you and the Paltrow family? You are now the heir of the Augustine family, so your business is the Augustine family's business. You want to kill Brad. I know I can't stop you, but I must go with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was surprised when he heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Isaac actually wants to go with me to kill Brad?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac said solemnly, "You don't have to thank me. I am doing this for the Augustine family. After all, you said that you are only 60% sure that you can kill Brad. If Brad escapes, it will be more disadvantageous to the Augustine family. Since we are going to kill him, we must ensure success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We must not let him spread the news. Even if the Paltrow family suspects us, we can deny it. I don't believe that the Paltrow family will really go to war with the Augustine family. In that case, the worst that can happen is that we fight them. There are no cowards in the Augustine family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac's face was full of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was very moved. He knew that although Isaac spoke righteously, as if everything was for the good of the Augustine family, in fact, Isaac was worried that he would suffer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated and nodded. "Thank you for helping me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. Let's go. We have to hurry up and not let Brad return to the Paltrow family's sphere of influence." Isaac pushed the wheelchair and prepared to leave with Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne stopped him and said calmly, "We can't go out like this. Don't forget, there is a traitor in the Augustine family. If Brad died after we go out, the Paltrow family may know through the traitor that we killed Brad. We must create an alibi."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac was shocked when he heard this. "How do we do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "It's very simple. We need to make people think that we are still here and haven't left."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Osborne suddenly waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a dimensional rift appeared in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac looked shocked. "Spatial power? Spatial power is rarely seen in a century. You are actually a spatial power metahuman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "I hope you can keep it a secret for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, he suddenly put his hand on Isaac's shoulder. A green magic light enveloped both of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, the dimensional rift swallowed the two of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Brad had already taken Lauren and the unconscious Yohan out of the Augustine Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They came to the Augustine Estate by a small speedboat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Paltrow Estate was on the other side. It was now the time for ordinary people to get off work. Driving was far less convenient than taking a speedboat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After boarding the speedboat, Brad still looked angry. "Damn the Augustine family. </span><span>Damn Osborne. Damn Isaac. You all deserve to die. Just wait. The Paltrow family will destroy all of you sooner or later. It won't take too long. Once Alexander has stabilized his realm, he will end you. You guys just wait."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Brad finished speaking, he looked back in the direction of the Augustine Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was this one glance that made his eyes widen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a dimensional rift appeared not far behind the speedboat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two figures walked out from the dimensional rift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Osborne and Isaac.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at Brad, who was leaving on a speedboat not far away, and sneered.</span></p><div class="pagination">
