  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What? She is Maia?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gasps filled the arena as everyone turned to stare at Emma in disbelief.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Most of the spectators had participated in Cuthbert's Honor Quest Ceremony and had witnessed firsthand his formidable strength. Typically, challengers barely lasted a single round against him, their efforts futile, with many unable to even touch him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, somehow, Cuthbert had failed to achieve fifty consecutive victories, a feat well within his grasp.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The reason? He had encountered not one but two extraordinary opponents.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The first of those was Maia.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Back then, Maia hadn't even made it onto the Godson Rankings. Everyone assumed she would be easily defeated by Cuthbert, perhaps even humiliated in the process.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Maia turned the tables&mdash;her Death Realm was shockingly powerful, inflicting real damage on Cuthbert and forcing him to tap into his Strength Realm, exhausting a significant amount of his energy.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Due to that unexpected outcome, Cuthbert, who aimed for a hundred consecutive wins, ended up losing in his fiftieth match to another anomaly&mdash;Axell.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because of that battle, Maia secured a place on the Godson Rankings, where the Prophet Alliance placed her at 299.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, they were discovering that the talented Maia was actually Emma in disguise!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Here she stood, looking no more than twenty-five years old, and she was the one who had previously made Cuthbert look so helpless!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The audience was stunned; jaws dropped as they processed the revelation.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa's eyes widened with shock as she regarded Emma. She had spent time studying the Godson Rankings and hadn't realized Emma had already made it into the top 300.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, Emma had been to Tethynia!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma had masqueraded as Maia, while Osborne had disguised himself as Axell; they were siblings!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That was something Osborne had never mentioned to Clarissa.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa frowned slightly, pondering, "Why has Osborne kept quiet about Emma being with him in Tethynia? Do they share some kind of secret?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A pang of unease hit her as the realization settled in.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Emma caught Clarissa's gaze and smiled gently, seemingly unaffected by the murmurs around her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hey, Clarissa, what do you say we have a little friendly competition?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa's thoughts were a whirlwind.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought, "Does Emma really want to go against me?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure!" Clarissa replied, feeling a spark of excitement.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though she acknowledged Emma's strength, she wasn't intimidated. Clarissa was ready to step into the arena.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma said, raising a hand to stop her, "Just a second, Clarissa. I'm not talking about a fight to the finish. I meant a friendly showdown. Let's each take a platform and face off against whoever dares to challenge us. We'll see who can last longer and defeat more challengers!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A gleam of determination lit up Emma's eyes as she finished her proposal.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa felt her brows knit together.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Deep down, she was more interested in a direct battle with Emma to see who was stronger, but if Emma preferred to avoid a clash, she wouldn't push it.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, she had come here to hone her skills against formidable opponents, and this arrangement aligned perfectly with her aim.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright then, let's do it!" Clarissa agreed, feeling invigorated.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Great! But let's put something on the line to make it interesting. What do you think?" Emma added with a playful smile.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa nodded. "You tell me."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma leaned in closer, lowering her voice to a private whisper just for Clarissa's ears. "Remember when I told you that I like Osborne?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa's expression turned icy.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She nodded, recalling their conversation well.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's your point?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma took a deep breath and said, "I want you to know that I think I've finally figured out what it means to love someone. So, I want to compete with you fairly! If you lose, I want you to give me a chance to pursue Osborne."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa furrowed her brow. "And if you lose?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I lose, I'll bless you both and promise never to interfere with your relationship," Emma replied earnestly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But inside, she thought, "If I lose, I'll just be Osborne's secret lover for life and keep you in the dark."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without hesitation, Clarissa nodded. "Alright, I accept!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A spark of excitement lit up Emma's eyes as she smiled, "Then let's do this! Clarissa, my level is higher than yours, so I'll have a bit of an advantage. But then again, pursuing love has never been fair, has it?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa nodded again. "That's fine by me.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Whoever gets knocked off the stage first loses!" Clarissa declared coldly, stepping toward the arena.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma followed, climbing onto the platform once more.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She scanned the crowd below and called out, "Ladies and gentlemen, we're here to welcome any challengers! If you've got the guts and the strength, step up and fight us!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, determination surged through Emma, and her fighting spirit ignited.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought, "I have to win this match!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's the only way I can be with Osborne openly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I must defeat Clarissa!"</p><div class="pagination">
