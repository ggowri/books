  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Bryce's unwavering confidence, the group couldn't help but look at him in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could he really have a solid idea?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Kendra, usually quick to poke fun, asked, "Bryce, do you really have something? Stop beating around the bush and spill it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone nodded, their eyes fixed on Bryce, eager to hear what he had in mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the attention on him, Bryce cleared his throat and said, "First off, let me ask you all. Who do you think are the most renowned figures in Celestara?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra rolled her eyes. "Who doesn't know that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's obviously Lord Malevolence! Right now, he rules over a huge chunk of Celestara. He's the undisputed king, so who could possibly not know him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others nodded in agreement, thinking Bryce was stating the obvious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Bryce chuckled, saying, "Okay, aside from Lord Malevolence, who else is widely recognized? It could be an individual or even a group!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, the group fell silent, exchanging puzzled glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who else, aside from Lord Malevolence, is well-known?" they said, realizing their knowledge of Celestara was rather limited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne didn't know much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah finally spoke up, "Let me take a crack at this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When it comes to being well-known in Celestara, there aren't many. Maybe a dozen or twenty names at most!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lord Malevolence goes without saying; everyone knows him! Even the wise Deathborns atop Divine Peak are aware of his presence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Beyond him, we can consider the Nine Dark Sovereigns under Lord Malevolence. They're his most trusted subordinates, incredibly powerful, and reportedly not much weaker than Lord Malevolence himself. Each of them is a top-tier Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Four of them command the Dark Deity Legions in the Central, North, South, and East Zones, each leading millions of troops. The other five serve as Lord Malevolence's personal guards, and they're rumored to lead their own mysterious armies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In short, the Nine Dark Sovereigns are definitely household names in Celestara! Their names are even known in the West Zone Human Community since they've been leading the Dark Deity Legions in battles against humans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their names are simple, almost like code names</span><span> </span><span>from Icy One to Icy Nine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The supreme leader of our East Zone's Dark Deity Legion is none other than Icy Nine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Hannah finished, the group nodded in understanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mila frowned, pondering the implications. "So, Lord Malevolence is already this powerful, and he has the Nine Dark Sovereigns at his side? All of them top-tier Deity Kings? I wonder how they stack up against the Seven Great Deity Kings of our Human Community?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mila had been born before Lord Malevolence invaded Celestara, during a time when Celestara was ruled by the Seven Great Deity Kings of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her mind, those seven were the pinnacle of power, the ultimate warriors of Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah continued, "I'm glad you brought that up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Seven Great Deity Kings of the Human Community are definitely well-known figures in Celestara! After all, they defeated Lord Malevolence over a thousand years ago! Sure, he was injured at the time, but he did lose that battle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Seven Great Deity Kings of the Human Community joined forces to defeat and seal Lord Malevolence! If it weren't for the sudden emergence of Divine Peak and the Deathborn, Lord Malevolence might still be trapped to this day!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's eyes sparkled with admiration as she spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she hailed from the Mystic Feather Clan, she held a deep respect for the Seven Great Deity Kings of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for your earlier question about how the Nine Dark Sovereigns stack up against the Seven Great Deity Kings, I can say objectively that the Seven Great Deity Kings are definitely a notch stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, they not only defeated Lord Malevolence back then but also took down the </span><span>Nine Dark Sovereigns in the process! It's no exaggeration to say that everyone among the various races feared the Seven Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But that was a long time ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Seven Great Deity Kings are now a relic of the past. Although they triumphed over Lord Malevolence in that earth-shattering battle a thousand years ago, they paid a heavy price. The God of Death, the God of Life, the God of Time, the God of Space, and the God of Destiny all fell during that conflict!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, only the God of Night and the God of Light remain alive among the Seven Great Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rumor has it that the God of Night was gravely injured by the Shadow Terror Fiend from the divine peak decades ago. Some even say he has fallen, as he hasn't shown his face in years!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The God of Night was undoubtedly the strongest among the Seven Great Deity Kings, and he was the only one capable of standing up to Lord Malevolence's attacks directly."</span></p><div class="pagination">
