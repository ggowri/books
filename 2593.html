  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The high platform of the Royal Family fell into dead silence, with shock written all over everyone's faces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emiliano had absolute dominance just now and seemed close to winning. No one expected the situation to suddenly reverse. His Supreme Sacred Artifact malfunctioned at the most critical moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one expected Emiliano to suddenly lose the match.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>People believed Emiliano was stronger than Clara, so no one expected that once Emiliano was bound by Clara's Sacred Artifact chains, he couldn't break free.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone present was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Royal Family members looked extremely grim. Emiliano's defeat forced them to face an incredibly embarrassing situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, among the top five in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, there are only two Royal Family princesses, while the remaining three spots are all taken by ordinary contestants!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If the Royal Family had only sent two princesses to compete, the situation would be understandable, but they sent a total of nine princes and princesses. Yet, seven of them didn't even make it to the top five, and five were eliminated after being defeated by ordinary contestants!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Royal Family members couldn't accept this result!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Royal Family members are usually very arrogant. Now, they can't accept such humiliation. But the fact is right in front of them, and they can only endure it. Listening to the rising discussions from the audience around them, they feel extremely aggrieved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Amid the whispers, there were even a few harsh laughs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They knew this wasn't the worst yet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At least here, out of respect for the Royal Family's authority, the audience didn't dare to go too far.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But across the entire territory of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, in the cities watching the competition projections, there were probably trillions already mocking them without restraint.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just the thought of this made the Royal Family members feel uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Clara wins! Advances to the top five!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Five-minute break, then the top five ranking battle begins!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Zorro announced the result, Clara retracted the iron chain and stepped off the arena.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked at Osborne, her eyes sparkling with excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I did it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and nodded. "Well done. But next is the top five ranking battle. Take a quick rest."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara smiled, "Making it to the top five is already my limit! I definitely can't beat Princess Seraphina, so I'll just go with the flow for the rest of the matches."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, however, shook his head.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No, you all must make it into the top three."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara was stunned upon hearing this. She exchanged a glance with Leroy, both frowning.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you saying we all have to make it into the top three?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But how is that possible! Even if we can defeat Princess Rosalie, we can't possibly beat Princess Seraphina! And you... if we face you, we'll surrender right away! So, no matter how you calculate it, the best we can do is third and fourth, there's no way we can all make it into the top three!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled, "Not necessarily!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I'm not mistaken, the first match of the top five ranking battle will definitely be between me and Princess Seraphina! What if I severely injure Princess Seraphina, making her unable to participate in the subsequent ranking battles?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy widened their eyes in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, Seraphina walked up to Callista with a stern expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Queen Callista, please make sure the first match of the top five ranking battle is between Osborne and me! Only then can we restore the Royal Family's honor!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista frowned upon hearing this, looking at Princess Seraphina.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why do you say that?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina said in a deep voice, "Now, only Princess Rosalie and I remain as members of the Royal Family in the top five. Frankly speaking, with Princess Rosalie's strength, she is bound to lose against Osborne, Clara, or Leroy! If we follow the normal battle sequence, she might lose three matches in a row, bringing even more disgrace to the Royal Family!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista's expression darkened, but she had to admit that Seraphina was right.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The strength displayed by Osborne, Clara, and Leroy was truly impressive. They could all easily defeat the fourth-ranked Princess Rosalie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, do you have a way to ensure Princess Rosalie doesn't lose?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina raised her chin, her tone filled with absolute confidence. "Of course! As long as we adjust the battle sequence, I can guarantee Princess Rosalie won't lose a single match! And I will definitely take the championship. By then, Princess Rosalie will be the runner-up. This way, at least the top two will still belong to the Royal Family, and we can salvage the situation."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista was a bit surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked at Seraphina and said, "Explain in detail."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina confidently said, "It's simple.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In the first match, arrange for me to fight Osborne. I'll break his leg directly or injure him severely so he can't continue competing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In the second match, let Clara face Leroy. The third match can be arranged between Osborne and Princess Rosalie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, Osborne will definitely be severely injured and withdraw, so Princess Rosalie will automatically win!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After that, I'll face Clara or Leroy. By then, I can also injure them severely and let Princess Rosalie fight them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This way, I can take out all three of them in advance. Princess Rosalie can win without a fight and secure second place!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Seraphina arrogantly raised her head.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I am absolutely confident that I can severely injure Osborne, Clara, and Leroy, making them unable to continue competing."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, the first match must be me against Osborne!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista pondered for a moment, then revealed a slight smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your plan is good, but are you really sure you can defeat Osborne? What if you lose?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Impossible!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina firmly said, "In the Racial Convergence Stellar Region, I am the strongest under Empyrean Sacredness! No one below Empyrean Sacredness can defeat me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if there is, it&rsquo;s absolutely impossible for them to appear in the Racial Convergence Stellar Region! Even in the deeper parts of the universe, such a person might not exist!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, under Empyrean Sacredness, I am invincible!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No one can defeat me, and whoever I want to defeat, I will definitely succeed!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina's face carried an almost arrogant confidence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista smiled and said, "Alright! Since you're so confident, I'll arrange it as you said. For the first match, I'll have you face Osborne."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hope you don't disappoint me, and even more so, don't disappoint your father. Otherwise..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't finish.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina turned around nonchalantly and said calmly, "Don't worry, I won't disappoint you. I just didn't have the chance to act before. If I had met them earlier, I would have already kicked them out one by one!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Super dark horse?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hah, in front of me, any dark horse will just become a useless horse!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Seraphina turned and left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista quickly informed Zorro of the arranged battle order.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zorro immediately became excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Five-minute break is over! Now begins the top five ranking battle! Each contestant will face off in a round-robin, and the final rankings will be determined by the number of wins!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The first match is about to begin."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Princess Seraphina versus Osborne!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
