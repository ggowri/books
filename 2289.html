  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That kind of assessment was exclusive to Agatha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the official assessment of Zephyr State, Agatha, Horace, Broderick, and Benson were all one-man armies. It meant they stood a good chance of making it into the top ten even without forming teams or getting any assistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, among them, only Agatha was a sure-shot for a top-ten spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some even mused that she could take the championship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All she needed was a stroke of luck!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From that brief assessment, everyone could sense Agatha's might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when they actually laid eyes on her, the crowd soon realized that what really stole the show wasn't her strength, but her looks!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Agatha made her entrance, almost every guy in the place was left gobsmacked, captivated by her breathtaking beauty and alluring curves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the ladies couldn't tear their eyes away from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was just drop-dead gorgeous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there were a few who remained unmoved by Agatha's beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Take Horace, for example.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The instant he saw Agatha, a fierce fighting spirit blazed in Horace's eyes. The power swirling around him went haywire, surging towards Agatha like a wild tempest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holy smokes! He actually threw down the gauntlet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one saw Horace's attack coming in this place. By the time folks snapped out of their shock, Horace's power was already bearing down on Agatha like a freight train.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic swept across everyone's faces like wildfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Agatha was as cool as a cucumber. She just gave a nonchalant wave of her hand, and poof! Horace's power vanished into thin air, like it had never even existed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horace's eyes widened in shock, his face set in a grimace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Broderick, Benson, and the rest also looked like they'd just swallowed a lemon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Agatha spoke up, her voice as smooth as honey, "Horace, if you're itching for a fight, hold your horses till the state duel officially kicks off. We can find a nice spot and go toe-to-toe! Right now, the duel's not even started. No need to be so trigger-happy, or you might end up dragging innocent bystanders into the mess."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horace let out a scoff, his fighting spirit still burning bright. "Agatha, you better believe I will! When the state duel rolls around, we'll settle this once and for all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure thing!" Agatha replied, sounding as blas&eacute; as can be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a quick look around the area before pulling her gaze back in, her face as expressionless as a stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like she didn't even consider anyone there a real worthy opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no hint of contempt or disdain on her face, but everyone could feel her cold indifference, and it rubbed them the wrong way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what could they say?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha was a force to be reckoned with. Even though Horace's earlier attack wasn't a full-power attack, it still sent shivers down their spines. If it were them on the receiving end, they probably wouldn't stand a chance, even if they went all out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Agatha had just flicked her hand, and Horace's power was history. It was like she was swatting away a pesky fly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others? They couldn't even come close to her level of cool-headedness and raw power. It was like trying to catch lightning in a bottle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne's face was as serious as a heart attack at that moment. He could feel the heat from Agatha, and it was making his palms sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's a real oddball!" Osborne muttered under his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether he could take her down or not was anyone's guess until they stepped into the ring at the state duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson, Broderick, Horace, and Agatha were all holding their cards close to their chests. None of them had shown off their Sacred Artifacts yet, and those things were like wild cards in a high-stakes poker game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha's Phoenix Cry Bone Flute and Horace's Frost-invoking Canvas were no joke. They were well-known for giving even the big-wigs in the Empyrean Sacredness level a run for their money. Osborne wasn't sure if he could stand up to their might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One thing was for sure, the state duel was going to be a real barn-burner!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Making it into the top ten wasn't going to be a walk in the park. He'd have to fight like a cornered animal, tooth and nail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that little showdown, no one else really caught Osborne's eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that all the top ten were gathered there, Osborne took a quick once-over, sized up their general strength, and then tuned out. He knew the real battle was yet to come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was still a huge gap in strength between them and Agatha, Horace, Broderick, and Benson. It was like comparing a candle to the sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Clara, standing beside Osborne, murmured with a solemn look in her eyes, "Wow! This is really a gathering of the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara continued, heaving a sigh, "When you think about it, making it into the top ten in the state duel is like walking through the valley of death! Compared to the state duel, our city duel in Tempest Fortress City was a piece of cake! The city duel was basically just a showdown between the top dogs of three Second-rate Powers. But the state duel... there are at least hundreds of top disciples from Second-rate Powers, not to mention the top guns from three First-rate Powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just too tough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A look of discouragement flashed across Clara's eyes. During the city duel, she'd been as confident as a peacock. She even thought she had a fighting chance against Leroy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the state duel, there were a ton of people who were clearly stronger than her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the worst part was, that these powerhouses could team up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How on earth could they compete with that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, Clara had thought that with a bit of luck, they might just scrape into the top ten. After all, in the world of duels, anything could happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, a sense of hopelessness washed over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara exclaimed, "No wonder so many of the top-hundred rankers are willing to be hired guns for others. They know their odds of making it into the top ten are as slim as a reed. So, they might as well lend a hand and get some dough in return!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara's lament made Osborne let out a soft chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, what's this? Are you throwing in the towel already? Deciding to give up the battle for the top ten?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara forced a wry smile. "I'm not quitting! I'm just being realistic. I'll take this as a learning experience. If I break through to Empyrean Sacredness in the next ten years and get a shot at the next state duel, I'll surely be a force to be reckoned with. I wanna shine as bright as Agatha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, a fire of determination blazed in Clara's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled encouragingly, "I'm right behind you! Your talent is no slouch compared to theirs. And of course, it'd be a dream come true if you could break through to Empyrean Sacredness in ten years."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara gave a nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the booming voice rang out once more. "Is everyone here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A middle-aged man materialized in the air right in front of the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His presence was as imposing as the ocean. When his eyes swept across the crowd, it was like an electric shock went through each of them, leaving them all tingling from head to toe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This man was a heavy-hitter from the Zephyr State government and the head referee of the state duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha, Horace, and the others at the front quickly bowed to the middle-aged man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good day, Mr. Carroll!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rupert Carroll, the chief judge, nodded back at Agatha and the gang. Eventually, his eyes landed on Agatha and Horace, and a smile spread across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was obvious that he had high hopes for these two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't say a word about it. Instead, Rupert scanned the crowd and declared, "Those who aren't here are considered to have thrown in the towel! Now, let me introduce myself. I'm Rupert Carroll, the chief judge of this state duel. You can call me Mr. Carroll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I'm gonna lead you to the combat zone of the state duel. Starting tomorrow, for the next seven days, that's where you'll be hanging out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone who takes off without permission will be counted as a quitter!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got one day to get the lay of the land!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Rupert finished his spiel, the crowd started buzzing like a hive of bees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One guy at the front piped up and asked, "Mr. Carroll, where on earth is this state duel gonna take place?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rupert gave a little smile and decided it was time to spill the beans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Arctic Maw Chasm!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
