  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When stepping into the Supreme Sacred Artifact area, Osborne actually didn't hold much expectation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought Michelle's relic should have long been gone from the Royal Treasury.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps Michelle's relic was indeed once stored in the Royal Treasury, but over more than a thousand years, who knows how many Royal Family members visited here and took away their desired Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among them, it likely included Michelle's relic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne believed Michelle's relic was most likely not a Supreme Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, she was just a maid, holding a status in the Royal Family equivalent to a guard, with a cultivation level only at advanced Empyrean Sacredness, making it impossible for her to possess a Supreme Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those three relics most cherished by Michelle were ancestral items she already possessed before giving birth to Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, when Osborne stepped into the Supreme Sacred Artifact area, he scanned around with Satan's Eye and unexpectedly found one of Michelle's relics.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a token!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A seemingly ordinary token, just like that ring, engraved with a blooming purple flower, surrounded by patterns of Sacred Dragons and phoenixes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On its back, only one name was engraved, "Michelle!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was his mother's name.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly walked toward the token, looking at it with joy in his heart. "I found it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But when he saw the redemption price of the token, he was stunned. "Redemption price: 18 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned deeply.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Royal Treasury holds over ten thousand Supreme Sacred Artifacts, with redemption prices ranging from 5 billion to 50 billion Scorepoints. However, most items are priced below 10 billion Scorepoints, with only a few exceeding 10 billion Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These are all the most supreme among the Supreme Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under Osborne's Satan's Eye observation, he found nothing special about the token. Although its power indeed reached the level of a Supreme Sacred Artifact, it was no stronger than other similar items.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Its effect is actually quite simple.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is a Defensive Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When activated, the token releases a powerful defensive force.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why is it so expensive?" Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But no matter how expensive it was, this was Michelle's keepsake, and Osborne was determined to get it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, without hesitation, he placed the Kingdom Duel Badge onto the token, instantly deducting a total of 18 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, and the formation on the token disappeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne held the token in his hand, feeling waves of warmth flow into his body, bringing him great comfort.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Mother's second keepsake, I finally found it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne excitedly tried to put away the token, but to his surprise, he couldn't.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't place the token into the Dimensional Bag, store it in the Satan Space, merge it into his body, or hang it on the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why?" Osborne couldn't help but feel puzzled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was the first time he had encountered such a situation. He wondered what was so special about this token that it could resist all storage methods, as if a mysterious force was preventing everything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Could it only be carried around?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't have time to study it further at the moment. After thinking for a while, he could only hang the token on his waist and cover it with his clothes, which wouldn't hinder his movements.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He muttered to himself, "Of my mother's three most cherished relics, I've now found two."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But the last one is clearly not in the Royal Treasury!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had searched every corner of the Royal Treasury. If Michelle's relic was here, he would have found it. But in the end, he found nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He did not find Michelle's most cherished necklace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "That necklace seemed more important to my mother than the ring and token. Because the necklace is part of a set with the Orb of Reincarnation. When I was born, she split the necklace in two. She kept the necklace, while the Orb of Reincarnation was given to me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Orb of Reincarnation was the only relic Michelle left for Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without the Orb of Reincarnation, Osborne could never have completed reincarnation so easily! Ophelia, Clarissa, and Emma couldn't have completed their reincarnations so smoothly either!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Orb of Reincarnation possesses the ability to interfere with reincarnation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne studied the Orb of Reincarnation and discovered its power was only equivalent to an ordinary Inferior Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An Inferior Sacred Artifact cannot possibly interfere with reincarnation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not to mention an Inferior Sacred Artifact, even a Supreme Sacred Artifact couldn't achieve that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But it still happened in the end.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking back now, he realized the Orb of Reincarnation definitely held secrets, and the accompanying necklace might have secrets too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Maybe, only by finding my mother's necklace and reuniting it with the Orb of Reincarnation can its secrets be unveiled," Osborne muttered, his eyes full of determination.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I must find my mother's necklace. Finding it might not only reveal the secrets of the Orb of Reincarnation but also unravel the mystery surrounding my mother!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne believed even more in what Primordial had once said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His mother was not just a maid of the Palace; she must have hidden secrets.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Mother's ring and token are both in the treasury. Logically, the necklace should be there too, but it's missing now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There's only one possibility.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The necklace was taken by someone. A Royal Family member entered the treasury, fancied my mother's necklace, and took it. Now, the necklace must be in the hands of a Royal Family member.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I must find a way to get it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, there's only half an hour left. I should quickly exchange the remaining Kingdom Duel Scorepoints for a Sacred Artifact to boost my strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, these points will be wasted!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and once again looked around at the other Supreme Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, his mindset was completely different from before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, he was solely focused on finding Michelle's relic, so he merely glanced at the Sacred Artifacts in the treasury without taking a closer look.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter how powerful the Supreme Sacred Artifact, it could never compare to Michelle's relic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, with the search for Michelle's relic temporarily on hold, he could finally take a serious look at the Sacred Artifacts here and carefully make his selection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He first glanced at his Kingdom Duel Badge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before entering the treasury, he had 57.5 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints. Redeeming Michelle's ring cost 500 million Scorepoints, while the token engraved with Michelle's name used up 1.8 billion Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Currently, he has 39 billion Scorepoints remaining.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>39 billion is still a massive number.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among the tens of thousands of Supreme Sacred Artifacts stored around, he could redeem most of them. If he chose ordinary Supreme Sacred Artifacts, he could even get seven or eight pieces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, ordinary Supreme Sacred Artifacts did not attract Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What he needed was a Supreme Sacred Artifact that could significantly enhance his strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, he might as well not redeem anything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Let me see what good stuff is here. Since I'm here, I must take the best Supreme Sacred Artifact!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne activated Satan's Eye to scan again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The aura intensity, attributes, and even general functions of each Supreme Sacred Artifact were now clearly displayed before his eyes for quick evaluation.</span></p><div class="pagination">
