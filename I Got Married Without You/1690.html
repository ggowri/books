        <h1>Chapter 1670 James and Ryan met again</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony just smiled, "If she's doing well, I won't bother her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that Edith no longer loved him, so he forced himself to approach her, only causing her distress. Having the chance to just catch a glimpse from afar was enough for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling guilty for the pain he caused Kate, Anthony apologized softly, "I'm sorry, it's my fault that I hurt you and Edith."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony smiled faintly, "If you agree to Paul marrying Ms. Miller, consider it a compensation for us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His demeanor was so impressive that Kate couldn't even look directly at him. "Sorry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony didn't say anything, just raised his eyes to the wedding hall. "Kate, the wedding is about to start. You must be busy, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching the polite Anthony, Kate suddenly remembered that he had never said anything hurtful to her. Even when she hit him or yelled at him, he always maintained his manners and politeness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After realizing this, Kate felt that her past self was truly cruel. But time wouldn't give her a chance to regret, the damage had already been done, and no amount of apologies could change that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stopped apologizing and turned to Edith. "Edith."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate wanted to help Anthony persuade Edith again, but when Edith heard her voice, she didn't even turn around and walked away directly...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching that figure, Kate sighed heavily. It seemed that her daughter still couldn't forgive her...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After James boarded the ship with Amelia in his arms, he affectionately patted her head and said, "Wife, I need to take care of something with them. You go inside first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The "them" he referred to were S's people, the members disguised as bodyguards following him. After Amelia glanced at them, she nodded at James, "I'll wait for you at the entrance of the wedding hall."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James responded with a grunt. After watching her turn and leave, his gentle gaze disappeared, replaced by a stern look as he turned to S. "Emily just entered the Lakeview Hotel. You guys stay here and secretly follow her. Report to me as soon as you have any news."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After exchanging glances, the members frowned and asked James, "And what about you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zack went to accompany Gigi, Andrew returned to the Simpson family, and Mr. Shawn's two strong arms were not here at such a critical moment. Now even this team had to be sent out. Who would ensure Mr. Shawn's safety?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, however, didn't care at all. "Don't worry, with Peter here, no one dares to make a move."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even if Peter could handle ten opponents alone, the members were still worried. "Just afraid that what happened earlier was a trap set by Erebus to lure us away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While James pondered in silence, the team leader said, "Sir, I will follow them and leave some of my team members to protect you and your wife."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James had sent everyone away because he was afraid that he alone couldn't handle Erebus's people. He asserted strongly, "You all go together. My command is only given once."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing Mr. Shawn's temperament, the team leader didn't dare to persuade further. After giving the members a signal, he quickly left the ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James watched their figures, his brows tightly furrowed, and he couldn't shake off his uneasiness. Ever since Emily and Mr. Ben joined Erebus, S's members frequently encountered trouble, either being exposed or disappearing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a heavy heart, he turned and walked towards the wedding hall. Amelia said she would wait for him here, and she had been standing here obediently without moving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her well-behaved appearance, James's gloomy mood lightened slightly. He approached and affectionately kissed her forehead, then held Amelia's hand and walked into the wedding hall. However, at the entrance, they coincidentally bumped into Ryan being pushed out by Zoey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind Ryan was Edith. He had come out of the wedding hall to avoid her, but ended up encountering James and his wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James and Ryan, seeing each other face to face for the first time in a long while, were both tall men, with one standing and the other sitting. After briefly sizing each other up, they quickly looked away. James's gaze landed on Edith, while Ryan's gaze fell on the couple holding hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neither of them said anything, only Edith sheepishly stuck her tongue out at James. "James, I'll go check if the bride is ready..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith slipped away, leaving only the three of them. James and Ryan didn't really have any emotions towards each other, but Amelia felt awkward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she was thinking about how to break the silence, a loud voice suddenly sounded from behind her, "Amelia, I've come to give your sister a wedding gift-"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia turned her head and saw Johnny in a black suit, walking steadily up the deck. Following behind him were Herb, Zack, and Gigi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the moment these inappropriate individuals appeared, James's eyes darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan attending the wedding, he could understand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zack coming with Gigi, since they were acquainted, he could understand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why did Johnny, who secretly loved Amelia, and Herb, who was trying to pursue Amelia, come here?</span></p></div>
