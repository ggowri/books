        <h1>Chapter 1621 A beautiful tragedy</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Stella was pushed into the incinerator, Amelia couldn't bear to look. She turned her head and nestled into James' arms, tears streaming down her face like broken beads. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her best friend, Stella, had ultimately turned into a handful of ashes, placed in a small box. It was unclear whether she had lost her freedom or regained it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All that mattered was that Stella was no longer in this world. She followed the person she loved to another realm, where she could reconstruct her own happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In reality, this was just a beautiful tragedy. After death, there was nothing left. The so-called soul was merely the expectations bestowed upon the living... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until Erin and Stella&rsquo;s deaths, one thought the other didn't love him, one only realizing her deep love in the end... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it regrettable? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, it was regrettable. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that was the ending. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Stella's cremation, Henry personally scattered her ashes in the sea, in the waters near the island where Erin was. Even though their ashes floated away with the wind and left no trace, Henry still erected a tombstone for the two of them... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the tombstone, their names were engraved as a couple... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought that once their souls met, this would be their resting place. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ultimately, people still needed some fantasies and expectations, or else what would support them? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of people stood in front of the tombstone, standing there for a whole night until the wind and rain grew fierce, forcing them to leave. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rain was like Stella not wanting her friends and family to be sad for her, purposely sending down a shower to drive them away. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone left the island, except for Henry. He stood in front of the tombstone with an umbrella, unwilling to leave. Letting the rainwater seep into his clothes seemed to lessen the pain in his heart. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, his body couldn't hold on any longer, and he collapsed in front of the tombstone. James sent someone to carry him back to the ship... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he woke up, he was already on a private plane heading back home. He returned safely, while Stella remained forever in that country, on that island... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Henry pushed open the blinds on the plane and looked out at the blue sky and white clouds... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, he felt as if Stella and Erin had met under such a beautiful landscape. This time, they loved each other wholeheartedly, without any impurities. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gently leaned his head against the window, and his lowered eyelashes indicated that he had accepted the fact that Stella had left... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew, sitting in front of him, stared at Stella's only photo in the album for a while before getting up and walking towards James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Evans, I want to avenge Stella." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impeccably dressed man raised his thick eyelashes and gave Andrew a faint glance. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you have a plan?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew shook his head. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen had already been sent to prison, and the most they could do was let her die there. But they felt that this punishment was letting her off too easily, yet they didn't know where to start seeking revenge. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's simple." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The coldness in James' eyes showed no emotion, making it impossible to tell what he was thinking. Even Andrew, who had grown up with him, couldn't see through him and didn't know what he meant by "simple." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An eye for an eye." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James accepted the blanket handed to him by the flight attendant and gently covered Amelia. Then, he raised his icy gaze, freezing Andrew in place. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The more she wants something, the less she'll get it." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the best revenge. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the guidance from James, Andrew's first action upon returning to his home country was to kick open the door of the Simpson family and, holding a knife, charge towards Thomas. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas was startled. "What are you, this traitor, trying to do?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After giving Thomas a casual glance, Andrew sat down on the couch as if he were in his own home. He propped his long legs up on the coffee table. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From today onwards, I'm going back to the Simpson family and become the heir of the Simpson family!"</span></p></div>
