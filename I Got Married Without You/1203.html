        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gloria not only failed to reflect on her own mistakes, but also screamed at James with a broken heart, "James, did you switch the medicine, did you?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Gloria who had already fallen into a state of madness, James said expressionlessly, "You are smart all your life, but you don't even know who switched the medicine, how pathetic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her twisted face slowly calmed down, "If it wasn't you, then who could it be? Carol saw me switch the medicine, was it her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After questioning, she shook her head and denied, "No, no, Carol is a member of the </span><span>Leinster family. She killed my son and has no benefit from doing this. She couldn't have done it. Could it be Dominic, or the old housekeeper who takes care of Simon, or the enemy of the Evans family? Who could it be?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She guessed and guessed, but never thought it was Emily. It shows how clever Emily's methods are, she even fooled Gloria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Similarly, if Emily had not said that she was the only one who knew the truth about Simon's death, James would not have suspected her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giving Simon medication to lower his intelligence is not something that can be successful with just one dose. It must be changed regularly, and it's not surprising if someone discovers it during this period.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Carol has seen Gloria changing the medication, so Emily, who frequently visits Evans' house under the guise of visiting Simon, must have seen it too...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily said that she agreed to be Simon's girlfriend to get close to James. With this in mind, Emily would naturally take action if she discovered that Gloria had changed James&rsquo; medication.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Emily could just throw away the medication. Why did she have to change it for Simon?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did she not know that the medication could kill Simon? Or did she want to use this opportunity to kill him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Emily is in Erebus, the only way to find out the truth is to wait for James to go to Erebus and interrogate her. Otherwise, Simon will really die without closure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James looked up and glanced at Gloria, who was still babbling and guessing randomly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, he didn't tell her who changed the medication. He let her carry the guilt and doubts about Simon and go crazy in prison, and end her life like that...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James tightly held Amelia's hand and turned to leave the prison.</span></p></div>
