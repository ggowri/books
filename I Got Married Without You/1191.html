        <h1>Chapter 1191 James overcame the mental barrier</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, it's fine now. My psychological barrier is gone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Will our cousin relationship affect us?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he will work hard to overcome this obstacle, as long as she is there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his eyes, there is no moral code, only Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After James finished speaking, Amelia clearly felt his actions become gentle, even his kisses were filled with infinite affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hazy mind and blurred vision were led by James into an unprecedented experience, one that she would remember for a lifetime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, James held her waist and gently patted her back, allowing her to regain some consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She leaned against him and asked tiredly, &ldquo;How did you... learn so much?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He whispered in her ear, &ldquo;I learned it for you.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted her to remember for the rest of her life that there was a man in bed who could give her an unforgettable experience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sweet feeling rose in Amelia's heart, but she still worried about him. &ldquo;Can you tell me what Dominic said to you just now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's relaxed expression gradually turned cold. &ldquo;I learned a secret, but I can't tell you.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia frowned and asked, &ldquo;Why not? "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James lightly kissed her cheek. &ldquo;Because I can know a secret and not get divorced, but if you know, you will definitely divorce me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her moral code was much heavier than his, so why burden her with this guilt?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would bear it all, anyway he had no moral code to speak of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was even more confused. What secret could it be that would make </span><span>her</span><span> want a divorce after she found out?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking for a moment, A</span><span>melia</span><span> spoke softly and advised him, "No matter what the reason is, I won't divorce you. Unless we're siblings, but that's impossible. So you should tell me. Maybe I can help?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man holding her stiffened for a moment upon hearing this, but quickly regained his composure. "It's nothing. Leave it to me. I'll handle everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't want to say, </span><span>so</span><span> she didn't want to push him. "Okay..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>J</span><span>ames</span><span> lowered his head and kissed her forehead again before picking her up and carrying her back to the master bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You go to sleep first. I'll take care of the trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After tucking her in and covering her with the blanket, he got up and left the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching his tall, straight, and stubborn figure leave, A</span><span>melia</span><span> let out a heavy sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This man was always like this, solving everything on his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He really loved her to the extreme, not letting her worry about anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A</span><span>melia</span><span> thought that as long as he wasn't influenced by others and wanted to divorce her, she would give him some personal space.</span></p></div>
