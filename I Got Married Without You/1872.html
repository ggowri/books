        <h1>Chapter 1872 You come alone</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty raised his thick eyebrows, seemingly surprised that James would propose such a condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty didn't trust James that much, but he wanted to know who the founder of S organization was. "If you deceive me, you will never see Amelia again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What right do you have to threaten me now?" James' deep voice echoed through the broadcast into Matty's ears. "I am negotiating with you only because of my wife." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant that if Amelia wasn't in Matty's hands, James wouldn't have any reservations?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now completely defeated, Matty indeed had no right to threaten James. He couldn't really harm Amelia, could he?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After careful consideration, Matty pressed the broadcast button again. "Tell me who the founder of S organization is, and then I will release Amelia." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint smirk appeared in James' indifferent eyes. "You think you can get the information without releasing her?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then come in and get her." Matty calmly informed James of the location of the escape room. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At the end of the biochemistry corridor, behind the square white wall, is the escape room. The password for the control panel is 794203, come alone." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cautious approach was the last resort for a loser, and Matty demonstrated it perfectly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden and Emelyn were speechless, shaking their heads at James almost simultaneously, indicating that he shouldn't go. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James glanced at the two, then looked beyond the 48 bodies lying in the glass chamber, towards the end of the corridor. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Matty, let me say it again, you have no right to make demands in front of me now, you better personally bring my wife out, otherwise you won't get any information, and your people will die." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty knew very well that James was in a position of power now, and he had the final say in negotiating and making demands. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Matty, who had already been defeated, couldn't accept being manipulated by James, a younger man. "You claim to love Amelia so much, yet you're unwilling to come and get her yourself. How can I trust her in your hands?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you, claiming to be her grandfather, why are you unwilling to bring her out yourself?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Between the two, it had become a competition of who was more ruthless. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, Matty always had the upper hand in this aspect. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Matty directly pulled up the surveillance footage of Amelia's room. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, who had intended to continue the standoff with Matty, had his blue pupils suddenly contract at the sight of Amelia's figure. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sat alone on the bed, despite being pregnant, her body still frail, and her face pale. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was all alone, confined to the room, unable to hear or see anything, appearing extremely lonely. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Amelia in such a desolate and helpless state, James felt extreme heartache. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a couple of seconds, he made up his mind. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without saying a word, James walked directly towards the escape room, his back exuding fearlessness. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had enough confidence to continue the standoff with Matty, but he didn't want to delay and let Amelia suffer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden, Emelyn, Andrew, and Johnny didn't care much either. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They raised their hands and followed James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing this group of people in the surveillance, Matty's deep and solemn voice immediately spread throughout the biochemistry area through the broadcast. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Evans, if you insist on bringing so many people in, then our negotiations are off." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty added one more sentence. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will take Amelia with me now."</span></p></div>
