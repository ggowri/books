        <h1>Chapter 1972 Parents' Love</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As James walked into the living room, he paused when he heard Maxwell's cries. His fingers loosened the tie as his cool gaze swept over to the small figure leaning against the kitchen door, clearly enjoying the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of James' voice made Alexander's body stiffen. He suppressed the amusement in his eyes and turned to face the man who was removing his suit jacket and handing it to the servant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James' voice was low and calm, yet it held an air of authority. Even the dismissive Alexander couldn't help but respond. He took a few reluctant steps forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James loosened his tie and handed it to the servant before staring at Alexander, who stood silently before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apologize to Maxwell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, who didn't think he had done anything wrong, smirked and refused to talk to James. He stood rooted to the spot and crossed his arms as a silent protest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to stand here and play doorman, then stay standing. If you move even an inch, you have to apologize to Maxwell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James' cold words left Alexander in a dilemma. He furrowed his thick eyebrows and glared at James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't even look at him. He instead went straight to change his shoes and headed upstairs. This infuriated Alexander, who clenched his fists and scowled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxwell, who had been planning to cry and go to Eva, stopped crying when he saw Alexander being punished. He raised his sleeve and wiped the cheese off his face. Then he ran over to Alexander, pressing his chubby nose against his face and making funny faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt that calling Maxwell an idiot was no longer enough. He learned not to argue with fools, so he simply closed his eyes and ignored him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Eva around, James decided not to venture into the backyard to find Amelia. Instead, he took a leisurely shower and emerged with his phone in hand. He scrolled through the IQ test results Amelia had sent, his mind drifting back to his childhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dominic took him for an IQ test when he was five. Initially, his results were similar to those of Alexander, but they gradually improved over time. James believed Alexander would follow a similar trajectory, but he couldn't help wondering if Alexander would surpass his intellectual level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While high intelligence wasn't inherently detrimental, James was particularly concerned about Alexander's personality. He needed proper guidance to prevent him from developing an overly arrogant attitude. After all, a genius with an inflated ego could easily crumble under the weight of defeat, leading to a downward spiral that could ruin his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James had initially intended to focus on Amelia and enjoy their remaining time together, but the current situation demanded his intervention. With a sigh, he put down his phone and headed downstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spotted Alexander standing stubbornly rooted to the spot. James remained silent for a few seconds, neither speaking nor approaching. Instead, he walked towards the kitchen, poured himself a glass of water, and sat down casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing James' pacing in the living room, Alexander tightened his grip on his fists, his tiny body rigid as if trying to prove a point to James. His entire back was ramrod straight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James noticed and teased, "Do you think you're the smartest person in the world?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander initially tried to ignore him, but upon hearing this, he retorted defiantly, "I'm still smarter than you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James sneered, "Perfect then. I've come across a few world-class puzzles that people with an IQ over 150 supposedly can't solve. How about we have a competition?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was drawn to admire intelligence and competitiveness by nature, but he was still a child and couldn't resist being provoked. "What's the point in competing with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James leaned back in his chair and turned to look at him. "If you solve them first, then I'll never bother you again and you can do whatever you want. But if you can't solve them, then from now on, you'll have to listen to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hung his head and pursed his lips, seemingly weighing the pros and cons. However, he wasn't one to hesitate by nature. After pondering for a mere two seconds, he nodded decisively. "Alright, it's a deal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that he had agreed, James remained seated, still as a mountain. Alexander frowned in confusion, "Aren't we supposed to compete? Why aren't you giving me the questions?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James raised an eyebrow lightly and mimicked Alexander's action. He lowered his disdainful gaze and stared at him coldly. "Apologize to Maxwell first. Otherwise, you're not worthy of competing with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt like he was going to be driven mad by James. "Mom is mine, and he's been bugging her. It's only right that I teach him a lesson, isn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's words implied that he refused to admit his mistake, but James didn't mind. He simply replied coldly, "She is not yours, but mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was a bit speechless. The last time he felt this way was just last Friday. He would never have thought that it was only Saturday and James was already putting on another baffling show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a determined clench of his tiny fists, Alexander turned to James and asked, "So, if I apologize to him, will you finally duel with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alexander take the bait, James remained calm and nodded subtly. Meanwhile, Alexander, wanting his parents to leave him alone, had no choice but to head to the kitchen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxwell was sneakily eating cheese when Alexander suddenly walked in. Startled, he quickly covered his face with his hands and exclaimed, "I'll never make a face at you again, just don't smear me!"</span></p></div>
