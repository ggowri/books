        <h1>Chapter 1654 It's impossible between us</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as these words were spoken, not only Paul, but even Kate couldn't understand. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had already come to apologize in person, so Eva didn't need to play hard to get anymore, right? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Eva wasn't playing hard to get at all. She really didn't want Paul anymore. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She grabbed Kate's hand, stuffed the black card into it, and quickly walked away. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Paul went crazy and chased after her, grabbing her and pulling her into his arms. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, if you think my mom's apology isn't sincere enough, just tell me. I'll make her apologize again. Don't say you won't marry me." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's embrace was like a vine, wrapping around her, making it difficult for Eva to break free and also causing her pain. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had embraced Elsie, Kayla, and countless other women before, and she used to not care, but now she felt dirty. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't even want to talk to him, just struggling to push him away, but Paul held onto her tightly, as if he would disappear if he let go. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, it was my mom's fault. She realized her mistake and came to apologize, which means she won't stop us in the future. Please calm down and don't reject me because of this." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, unable to break free, smelled the fragrance on Paul's body, reminding her of the pungent smell of alcohol that night. It made her feel nauseous and pushed him away frantically. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go of me!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Paul wouldn't let go, holding onto her tightly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I finally see you, how could I let go of you!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tight embrace was like a shackle, binding Eva, keeping her locked in. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't control her emotions and suddenly exploded - </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't touch me, don't touch me, I said don't touch me!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deafening roar and hysterical shoving frightened both Paul and Eva herself. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She slowly lifted her head and looked at Paul... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his eyes, she saw her reflection... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not the gentle and elegant appearance from before, but a distorted and resentful expression. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was afraid of becoming a shrew, but because of that 50% love, she had become the person she feared. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, she had become such a shrew... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her strong resistance made Paul slowly release his grip. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, don't be afraid, I won't touch you..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's tone was gentle, but there was a hint of fear in his eyes when he looked at her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Eva felt uneasy. When Daniel cheated on her, she had also shown this kind of look. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could imagine how ugly she looked when she got angry, to the point where the guilty party would be afraid to see her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hated this version of herself, extremely hated it, but she was also stubborn and unwilling to show her vulnerable side to others... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lowered her head and said "sorry" before trying to run away, but Paul stopped her again. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he didn't dare to touch her, but maintained an appropriate distance. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, what's wrong with you?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, she responded so tenderly to his touch. It had only been a while, so why was she now so resistant? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva kept her head down and remained silent. Her calm and composed appearance made Paul even more worried than when she was angry... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it because of my mom that you..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It has nothing to do with your mother." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then why?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Were there other factors besides his mother's interference? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Eva calmed down, she slowly lifted her chin and looked at the man blocking her path, but keeping his distance. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know it yourself. Why do I have to point it out and embarrass us both?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These cryptic words left Paul scratching his head in confusion. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do I know?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was he supposed to know? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him feign ignorance, Eva felt more and more disappointed in Paul. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, when Elsie asked him if he was comfortable, he responded, but now he acted as if he knew nothing. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paul, it's impossible between us. Don't come looking for me anymore." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She left these words behind and turned to leave, but Paul, who was still in a daze, chased after her again. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, explain yourself clearly. Even if you won't marry me, at least tell me the reason." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it because of his mother or something else? He had to know the reason.</span></p></div>
