        <h1>Chapter 1757 Can you be with me?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Amelia and </span><span>Johnny</span><span> thought that the seventh round of the game was over, they expected to have a week's break before the next round started, just like before. But as soon as they returned to their room, the mechanical voice immediately sounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two players, the eighth round of the fourth level will begin tomorrow, please be prepared in advance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia and </span><span>Johnny</span><span> looked at each other. Was it because the puppeteer behind Scarface had been discovered, so the game was moved up?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But who is the puppeteer behind Scarface, and why send someone to help them? They were both puzzled, but had to follow the rules of the game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, Amelia couldn't sleep well. She tossed and turned in bed, with images of Scarface being swallowed by a snake in her mind. Since coming here, she had seen too many bloody scenes, each time feeling fear and dread, but this time was different. Maybe... because of Zack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny</span><span>, on the opposite bed, heard her tossing and turning and turned to her. "If you can't sleep, talk to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia turned to him, hands on her cheeks, and asked, "Did Zack really get swallowed by a snake?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny</span><span> had the answer in his heart, but pretended not to know, shaking his head. "He's so skilled, he should be able to escape."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny</span><span> saw Amelia's daze and softened his voice to comfort her. "Don't think too much, we have a game tomorrow, so rest well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia asked, "What kind of game will it be tomorrow?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny</span><span> shook his head. "I don't know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia asked again, "Do you think we can pass the level?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny</span><span> nodded confidently. "We can."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia smiled bitterly. "You're optimistic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny</span><span> raised an eyebrow. "We both chose right in the blind selection today, which means we are the real Aces."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia chuckled at his teasing. "A few months ago, we did fight our way out on Paul's wedding ship. I hope we can keep that luck tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny</span><span> smiled. "Don't worry, I'll make sure you make it to the ninth round."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I make it to the ninth round, can I see him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny</span><span>'s heart ached, and the smile on his lips gradually disappeared. "In the ninth round, the Black Cloaked Man will appear, maybe he will come."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I miss him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long silence, Amelia said this quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, </span><span>Johnny</span><span> didn't want to talk to her anymore. He turned away from her, facing the white wall, showing his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After spending so much time with him, Amelia could now feel his emotional changes and knew that he was angry when he turned his back on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at his back for a moment, then called out to him, "</span><span>Johnny</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny</span><span> grunted coldly, "What's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, feeling a bit embarrassed, covered her stomach and said, "I... am hungry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sound of her soft voice, </span><span>Johnny</span><span>'s anger disappeared inexplicably. He got up, opened the bedside table, and took out an apple, then got out of bed and handed it to Amelia. "It's just what I left for you at night."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that she was always hungry at night, so he habitually left some food for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia took it and sat by the bedside, quietly eating the big apple in her hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Johnny</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As </span><span>Johnny</span><span> turned back to his own bed, Amelia suddenly called out to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for him accompanying and taking care of her, Amelia would have had a hard time making it this far.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the sincere gratitude in her eyes, </span><span>Johnny</span><span> waved his hand nonchalantly. "After we get out, give me all the prize money you win."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you need money?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't, but a few billion dollars won't hurt, it's enough for my future wife to spend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia smiled. "Do you have someone in mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny</span><span> looked at Amelia's smiling face in the dim moonlight. "Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't tell you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny</span><span> got into bed and turned his back to her. "Remember, give me the prize money, it's a deal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of it as a deal, she wouldn't feel burdened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia thought he didn't want to say, so she didn't ask anymore and continued eating the apple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing the apple and filling her stomach, Amelia soon felt sleepy. As she was </span><span>about to fall asleep, </span><span>Johnny</span><span>'s voice slowly sounded again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, there's a question I've been wanting to ask you, but I've been too afraid to ask."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia forced her tired eyes open and looked at </span><span>Johnny</span><span>, who was also lying on his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What question?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll ask you after the eighth round of the game is over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," Amelia said and closed her eyes to sleep, but </span><span>Johnny</span><span> didn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Amelia for a long time, then got out of bed and came to her side again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He squatted in front of the bed, reached out his slender fingers, and gently touched her cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If James dies, can you be with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his fingertips lingered on her eyes, </span><span>Johnny</span><span>'s eyes turned slightly red, but he smiled happily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't say anything, I'll take that as a yes."</span></p></div>
