        <h1>Chapter 1606 Hurting each other</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen still remembered when Erin couldn't find Stella and went crazy, interrogating her, asking her where she had sent Stella.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen said she didn't </span><span>know,</span><span> at that time she really didn't know who had rescued Stella. Erin saw that she didn't look like she was lying, so he thought Stella had left on her own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Erin had sent thugs to scare Stella, causing her to be gang-raped, pregnant, infected, and have an abortion. Stella didn't want to see him anymore, which made sense. Erin, who knew he was in the wrong, didn't search the world for Stella anymore. He probably thought that after Stella was away from him, she could start a new life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two met again ten years later. In those ten years, Erin had grown quite a bit. Probably because of Stella, he didn't speak coldly to Karen anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that time, Mike was born, and Karen could only deepen Stella's hatred for Erin through text messages in order to secure Mike's inheritance rights. Stella didn't forget her hatred for Erin and even came up with a scheme to make Erin fall in love with her and seek revenge on Erin...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella, who had this kind of mindset, would never give Erin a chance to explain. Karen was relieved because she knew that no matter how much Stella and Erin</span><span> hurt each other,</span><span> she would benefit from it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She occasionally instigated their relationship, including the little things between Henry and Stella. She would exaggerate the details for Erin to hear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Erin was under pressure from both Stella's provocations and her demands. Despite the pressure, he still insisted on marrying Stella. But how could Thomas agree to such a thing? Without thinking, he locked Erin up...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Erin was locked in a room, refusing to eat or drink, and had to endure the lies Stella brought. Although he didn't show any reaction on the surface, Karen knew that Erin's heart was bleeding. After all, Stella's words were about the intimate relationship between Stella and Henry...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She even had someone forge photos to give to the servants, enlarging them for him to see. Erin's eyes turned red with anger, and sometimes he even felt nauseous and vomited. Tears uncontrollably streamed down his face...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He probably thought Stella and Henry had done something, which was why he was so angry. In order to see Stella in a hurry, he even cut his wrist. Seeing Erin like this, Karen knew that Erin loved Stella deeply and knew that this kind of Erin would eventually die at Stella's hands...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As expected, not long after, news of Erin's death came. When Karen saw Stella's reaction, she already knew that Stella must have been the one who shot him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was because Stella was the one who shot him that she wanted to know the truth from back then so badly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen looked at her and smiled, "Stella, you killed Erin. If you want to blame someone, blame yourself. It has nothing to do with me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella's blood ran cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised her tear-filled eyes and stared blankly at Karen...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You killed Erin, you killed Erin, you killed Erin..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sentence kept echoing in her ears, leaving Stella stunned as if she had just realized what she had done. She couldn't even come up with a retort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because, indeed, she had killed Erin...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Stella suddenly grabbed her bag and ran out in a hurry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Karen gave a signal with her eyes, and someone immediately stepped forward to stop Stella...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella, blocked by several servants, tightly held her bag to her chest, feeling </span><span>dazed ,</span><span> standing still...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when she was at a loss about what to do, Andrew kicked open the door of the Simpson family's mansion, leading a group of bodyguards rushing in...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew, who still cared about Stella's safety despite his wife being pregnant, visited Mia and settled her at home before rushing to the Imperial Capital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He arrived just in time. Karen hadn't done anything to Stella yet, otherwise Andrew would have to tear down the Simpson family&rsquo;s mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Andrew rushed in, he quickly walked to Stella and kicked away the servants blocking her, then grabbed her wrist and pulled her out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this time, Andrew didn't even glance at Karen, which made Karen's face turn pale. Her own son ignored her existence. Was there no more family affection left?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen didn't know where she found the courage and hurriedly stepped forward to stop Andrew. "Andrew, you've only come back twice. The first time, you kidnapped your father, and now you want to take Stella away. You can't act so recklessly..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it didn't matter much if Stella knew the truth, the people she sent out hadn't reported back yet. She had to wait for them to erase any remaining evidence before she could let Stella go. Now she had to stabilize Stella and not let her go with Andrew no matter what.</span></p></div>
