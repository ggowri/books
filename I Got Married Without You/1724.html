        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's body stiffened, she didn't answer Johnny, but he continued, "Now that my sister's fianc&eacute; has passed away, how long are you going to keep hiding this from me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia looked up at Johnny and said, "I'm sorry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny wanted to confront Amelia, but when he saw her red and swollen eyes, he couldn't bring himself to say the words he wanted to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He simply withdrew his gaze from her and said coldly, "Go back and ask clearly, I'll come find you for the answer later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew James had been missing for three months, and now Holden had returned with Zack's urn, but James was still missing. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant that something big had happened, and Johnny couldn't even begin to guess what it was. Holden, on the other hand, knew exactly what had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia nodded at Johnny and quickened her pace, with Peter by her side for protection, as they hurried back to Blue Bay Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden didn't leave, he just sat in the couch, touching the urn, waiting for her to come back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, suppressing her feelings of sadness, approached Holden with her trembling body and asked, "Can you please tell me what happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The urn belonged to Zack, but that didn&rsquo;t mean James doesn&rsquo;t have an accident. Otherwise, he wouldn't have left a suicide note for Ryan. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia actually already realized this, but she was just liked Gigi, unwilling to believe it...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden withdrew his hand from the urn and looked up at Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's a place called Erebus, it's an organization similar to S, but their original intention was to target S. I don't know if the mastermind behind Erebus has a grudge against my foster father or Mr. Shawn, but anyone associated with S who goes in, never comes out..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, the place you went to was Erebus?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden nodded slightly, his eyes filled with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three months ago, Mr. Shawn and I went to Erebus. Zack joined us later, but he quickly caught up with us. It was only during the seventh round of the life and death game that Mr. Shawn encountered danger. Zack chose to sacrifice himself to protect him..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Holden reached out and touched Zack's urn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After the door opened, Zack fell into a pit of poisonous snakes and was bitten to death. The snakes devoured all of his flesh. Inside this pit, were the bones that Mr. Shawn and I risked our lives to retrieve..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Amelia heard about Zack's death, her blood froze in her veins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her mind, she pictured Zack and herself sitting together at the dinner table on a cruise ship, enjoying the ocean view while making fun of James' terrible cooking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, James, upon hearing them criticize him, had a cold expression on his face and forced Zack to eat everything he had made. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After reluctantly taking a few bites, Zack couldn't take it anymore and jumped onto the railing, shouting at James that his food was terrible. He would rather jump into the sea than eat anything made by James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, Zack was still so lively and energetic. How could it be that in just a few short months of not seeing him, he left this world in such a tragic way?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia couldn't accept it. "Could it be fake? Is Zack not really dead?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia couldn't believe it. "Is it possible that it's not true? Could Zack still be alive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could there be such a twisted game in this world, and how could there be such a cruel </span><span>place?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't believe it, but Holden told her word for word, "I saw it with my own eyes, along with Mr. Shawn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few months ago, Zack called him and asked him to let him know before he left. Holden agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;If I had known that Zack would secretly follow me and end up dying there, I would never have messaged him.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's heart skipped a beat, and then it tightened slowly, followed by a suffocating feeling that gripped her throat, making it impossible to breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, she moved her stiff and numb fingers and slowly looked at Holden across from her. "What about him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did Zack stay there forever? And what about James, did he also...stay there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden withdrew his fingers from the urn, seemingly at a loss for words and remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't rush him, she just quietly stared at the thin and tired Holden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long time, Holden finally lifted his head and said, "He's even worse off than Zack."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's heart stopped beating, her ears ringing and her vision instantly blurred. It was as if the whole world had frozen in place, taking away her soul and leaving her completely unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden was ready to be beaten by Amelia, but she didn't react at all. She just stared at him with a hopeless look, which made Holden's heart ache in sympathy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sitting there in a daze for a while, Amelia finally opened her mouth and tried a few times before she could make a sound. "How...did he die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden raised his hands and covered his face in agony. "Cranium opening, the final round of the life and death game. The loser will have their skull opened and their brain emptied of all its contents."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's tears fell once again, without warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, Mrs. Evans."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden got up from the couch and plopped down on his knees in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was the one who lost, but Mr. Shawn chose to sacrifice himself in order to keep me alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden bent his tall frame and pressed his forehead against the ground, apologizing over and over again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, sorry, sorry..."</span></p></div>
