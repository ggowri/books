        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, feeling the breeze on her face, lowered her eyelashes. "The United States also has many beautiful scenic places, natural winds, trees, and roads are all the same," she said. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene softly interjected, "Actually, I don't live in Canada permanently, I just come back once in a while. If you were there, I would come back often to see you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia responded, "If you want to see me, then come back to Arcadia." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene smiled lightly and raised an eyebrow, "Alright, that's what you promised me." Amelia remained silent, but Dylan laughed, "Eugene is usually very busy, so he barely has time to disturb you, don't worry." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan's relaxed demeanor prompted Amelia to speak, "You're not allowed to come and find me either." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan smirked and casually said, "Don't worry, I'll definitely come and find you for no reason at all." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three brothers, with Amelia, arrived at Owen's wife's company. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan mentioned that Owen's wife is an ordinary person, not from a prestigious family. After Amelia met her, she discovered that this woman was very capable and had single-handedly founded the luxury brand DK. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Stephanie, dressed in professional attire and high heels, with a neat and simple shoulder-length haircut, was shuttling around the office. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing her work, Stephanie looked at Amelia and the three Lawrence brothers, </span><span>quickly raised her hand and then someone led them into the meeting room. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephanie appeared much more confident in her professional field, and upon learning that they were there for styling, she arranged for a famous stylist to match Amelia's figure and appearance. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephanie was quite busy, and after instructing the stylist, she put her hand on Amelia's shoulder and, in a very generous manner, said, "Amelia, I have to go and greet a teacher. If you have any questions, just tell the stylist or my assistant. Don't be nervous or afraid." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, Stephanie left her assistant behind to prepare milk and cake for her, providing exceptional service. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>DK's main luxury items are handbags, followed by clothing, so the company often has various stylists and designers coming and going. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clothing under DK was endorsed by Eugene, and with such a family background and sister-in-law, Eugene was thriving in the film and television industry. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the stylist was working on Amelia's hairstyle, Dylan, who was also holding a magazine, was introducing the family's situation and the family's industries to her. Owen and Eugene are Bruce's children, and the Lawrence family has many industries. Bruce couldn't manage them all, so he handed over the position of group president to Owen. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In reality, Owen was not interested in business, but for the sake of the family, he had no choice but to take it on. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan, on the other hand, was River's child, an only child. River also had many industries to manage in the Lawrence family, but Dylan </span><span>didn</span><span>&rsquo;t want to help him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Amelia asked him why he </span><span>didn</span><span>&rsquo;t help River, Dylan said he </span><span>didn</span><span>&rsquo;t have any talent, but in Amelia's eyes, Dylan was much more capable than his other two brothers. Because he was mysterious enough. She wanted to know what Dylan was really busy with, but Dylan didn't tell her, and used excuses like managing the vineyard to dismiss her, so Amelia didn't ask anymore. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Dylan saw that she wasn't speaking anymore, he closed the magazine, propped his forehead, and said meaningfully, "So, I grew up by my grandfather's side. Whatever he asked me to do, I did." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stylist was still working on Amelia's hair, so she could only turn her head slightly to look at Dylan and said, "Your two brothers are doing their own things. Why do you only listen to Matty's orders?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan casually replied, "You may not know, but my grandfather is notoriously strict. My two brothers' personalities are not suitable for working with him. Owen is too decisive and Eugene is too rebellious, only I can balance their personalities." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan received a cruel education from an early age, and although he appeared noble and elegant, he was actually cold and indifferent. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Dylan very similar to Matty, but Dylan always maintained his humanity and would never resort to killing unless absolutely necessary. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia actually didn't care about how Dylan was doing, she only cared about, "What are you doing by your grandfather's side?"</span></p></div>
