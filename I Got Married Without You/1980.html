        <h1>Chapter 1980 Only Five or Six Years Left</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She seemed frantic, desperately searching for her phone, but her body was too weak to get up. Just when she was at a loss, unsure how to find a doctor, James slowly opened his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing those eyes, full of deep affection for so many years, Amelia's tightly wound nerves suddenly relaxed. Her hands, supporting her on the ground, lost their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears uncontrollably rolled down her cheeks. She was so scared that her lips trembled, unable to form a complete sentence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For nearly ten years, under James' love, Amelia had never cried. Now, because of a brief fainting spell, she was suddenly crying like this. James felt heartache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He endured his headache, sat up from the sofa, and grabbed her waist with one hand, pulling her from the ground into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James held her in his arms, then fell on the sofa. The back of his head, wrapped in thick hair, rested on the sofa pillow, and his delicate face, which showed no signs of aging, was slightly tilted up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was just sleeping deeply. Don't worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, his fingers brushed across Amelia's tear-streaked cheek, pretending nonchalance, and he pinched her cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've gained weight again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to divert her attention, but Amelia, with her tear-filled eyes, stared intently at James' pale face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sleeping deeply and not waking up when called?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's eyes were so clear that James couldn't meet her gaze. He could only move his hand from her waist to her back, pressing down to make her rest her head on his shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Silly girl, I was too tired. When you have a nightmare, you can't be woken up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't believe it. Even though she couldn't see his expression from her position nestled in his neck, she could guess why he had suddenly fainted. Her hands slowly moved up his chest to hold his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, we still haven't found a doctor who can remove the chip. I really feel so sorry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was also so scared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was afraid of losing James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was terrified of losing James, the man who loved her with his life, and that he might leave this world, leave her, in one night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that time came, what would she do? What about Alexander?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James placed his hand on Amelia's hair, gently stroking it in comfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I'll be fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before his son became an adult, he would find every way possible to stay alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia reached out, hugging his waist, burying her face deeply into his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't go to work anymore. I'll stay with you every day from now on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her dreams had been fulfilled. The remaining time, she would spend with this man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the past five years, Amelia had spent quite a lot of time with him. James didn't mind, but he did want her by his side day and night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When our son goes for college, let's travel the world."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia nodded obediently in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see the doctor first. If the doctor says it's okay, I'll go with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James agreed with a smile, then looked down at Amelia's tear-reddened eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't know my wife loved me this much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia no longer hid her love as she had before. She hugged him tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, if you are not here with me, my life wouldn't have much meaning. So for my sake, you have to take good care of yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James kissed Amelia's forehead, tenderly comforting her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if my body isn't here, my soul and memories will always be with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But that won't be you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James' heart clenched, but he didn't reply, only hugging her tightly with all his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor left behind by Matty rushed to the Blue Bay Island overnight to examine James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the examination, the doctor's expression was serious, making Amelia extremely nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor put down the instruments and replied, "It's still caused by the chip's movement. I'll prescribe some painkillers to manage the pain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, worried, looked at the doctor putting away the instruments. "Where has the chip moved to? Can it be removed now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor looked troubled, glancing at Amelia. "Mrs. Evans, the chip is still embedded in the brain tumor area, very deeply. The surgery I simulated before probably needs to be re-evaluated."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the years, the doctor had never stopped simulating surgeries to remove the chip, and he had made some progress recently. Now, it seemed all that work was in vain due to the chip's movement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's hope almost faded to nothing. "Is there no other way?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor looked at James, who was massaging his temples, and sighed deeply, "Perhaps in another decade, when medical technology advances, someone might be able to remove the chip."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But James' condition probably wouldn't last another decade. At best, he might hold on for another five or six years. The doctor didn't say this out loud, only advising Amelia, "Let him rest well and not overwork himself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the doctor didn't voice it, James understood. When Amelia wanted to beg the doctor to save him, he interrupted her, "Let the doctor go."</span></p></div>
