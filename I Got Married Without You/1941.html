        <h1>Chapter 1941 A very different experience</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's hard to say if it's moving or not, but in that moment, James suddenly understood why Amelia was willing to risk her life to give birth to their child, just by looking at this vibrant life in front of him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As James held the baby, basking in the sunlight with a faint smile on his lips, Amelia's eyes welled up with tears.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For this scene, no matter how many times it happened, she would always choose to give birth to this child.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul took out his phone and took a picture, sending it to a friend group where James wasn't present: "[Can you believe James, the tough guy, is actually holding a baby and even smiling!]"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sending it, Paul sat back and waited for his friends to make fun of him, but Eva nudged him with her elbow and said, "Quick, retract it, you sent it to the family group..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's smile froze again, quickly grabbing his phone to retract the message, only to see James on the other side motioning for him to bring it over. "Give it to me," James said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul tightly held onto his phone, refusing to give it up. "James, I sent a video to my friends by mistake, and it ended up in the family group. It's not a good influence. Eva told me to retract it. Just don't look at it, I'll send it to you privately when Amelia isn't around."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James couldn't be bothered with such a lame excuse and shifted his gaze to Eva. "Tell me about the night scene. I'll invest 30% for you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Eva, eager to please the big boss, revealed a big secret. "He and your other brothers have created a private group just for mocking you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, who had already put down the baby, swiftly stood up and hooked his arm around Paul's neck from behind, dragging him out of the hospital room. "Let's have a little chat," he said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul looked hopeless. "Bro, can you not hit my face later? I have a group meeting tomorrow, and I'm afraid of embarrassing myself."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia and Eva didn't hear James' response, but not long after, they heard Paul's cries for mercy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva went to take a look and saw Peter pinning Paul against the wall, while Andrew took off his shoes and tickled his feet with a feather.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James stood by with his hands in his pockets, wearing a satisfied expression as he watched Paul being punished.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva quickly snapped a picture of this scene and sent it to the group.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group instantly became lively.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, leave the group!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if we leave, James will find out. Let Eva use Paul's phone to dissolve the group chat."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget dissolving it, just let me delete Paul. We can cut off contact as long as James doesn't come after me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I told you this group wasn't safe. Now that James has found out, we won't have good days ahead of us."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't stand this punishment of tickling the feet."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Actually... I quite enjoy having my feet tickled."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eason, who was in Africa, suddenly interjected, and the group fell silent before responding:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're a pervert, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Disgusting!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, the four brothers left the group chat, and Eva, holding her phone, felt a bit </span><span>guilty as she looked at her husband, who was laughing so hard that tears were streaming down his face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva put away her phone and returned to the hospital room, showing Amelia the pictures she had taken and the news about the group chat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia smiled and shook her head, saying, "They're like children who never grew up. So immature."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva agreed, saying, "Exactly. Whenever Paul gets upset with your husband, he clings to his phone and goes crazy in the group chat. He wastes so much time on it every day."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia felt a bit envious of Paul, but at the same time, she felt sorry for James. Despite coming from the same family, but they had a very different experience. It seemed like James bore all the hardships alone.</span></p></div>
