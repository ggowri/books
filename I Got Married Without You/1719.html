        <h1>Chapter 1719 A shell without a soul</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With just a few words, Amelia's anxious heart was calmed, but her tears were uncontrollable, falling onto the paper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Was he doing okay over there?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cried and asked the stranger who was delivering the letter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the other person saw her tear-stained face, he hesitated for a second before nodding in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's doing well, please don't worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;When will he be back?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not sure about this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where exactly is he, what's his location? Can I go see him? I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia wanted to ask more, but the other person interrupted her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Evans, I have urgent matters to attend to and don't have time to chat. Excuse me for now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't wait for Amelia to nod, quickly turned around and got into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia clenched the letter tightly, standing still in shock as she watched the car speed away in the distance...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other side of the street, a black car hidden under the trees, started up and drove away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting in the car, Paul turned his head to glance at Amelia, who was gradually getting smaller outside the car window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia probably didn't expect that the one who would check in on her safety would be him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James had already arranged for him, so where did the real informant come from?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul lowered his gaze and looked at the other white envelope in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hope that after two months, this letter will always stay in his hands, and James can come back quickly from the dangerous situation he's in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia held the letter from James in her hands, soothing herself over and over again in her mind. The fact that he was able to send someone to deliver the letter meant he was still alive. As long as he was alive and well, what did two months of waiting matter?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With such determination, she stayed strong at home, patiently waiting for James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this time, Eva would also come to visit her, keeping her company and giving her warmth and strength. But nothing could ease her longing for her husband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia had lost her appetite and had become much thinner. Whenever Frank saw her like this, he would always try to persuade her to eat more. But she just couldn't bring herself to eat. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many times, she would just sit by the window, holding the letters that James had given her, lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another month had passed, and Amelia woke up once again from a nightmare. Her body was covered in cold sweat as she sat up in bed, leaning against the headboard and clutching her racing heart. Images of James covered in blood kept replaying in her mind...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been having a lot of nightmares lately, but none of them had felt as real as this one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She saw James in her dream, locked in a secret room, surrounded by a group of people in black clothes holding knives, picking at his meridians and cutting his wrists. He was trapped and unable to move, forced to endure the brutal torture inflicted by these people...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia couldn't tell if she was creating a fantasy world in her mind, or if James was actually going through such torment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She only knew that her longing, starting from this dream, gradually turned into fear, an endless and overwhelming terror that made her wish she could fly to James and bear all his pain for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time this thought came to her, she held onto James' envelope and told herself in her heart that James had sent someone to let her know he was safe, that he would </span><span>come back, and not to be afraid, just wait a little longer, and then wait a little longer...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this world, besides her anxiously waiting, there are two other women also waiting. One is Emelyn, who knows their fate is uncertain, and the other is Gigi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi was much more impatient than Emelyn and Amelia. After waiting for two months, she couldn't take it anymore and went straight to Amelia's house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Evans, Zack said he went on a business trip to Europe with your husband, but he still hasn't returned and hasn't even called. What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Amelia saw Zack following James, her hand holding the teacup trembled. If it wasn't for Gigi's quick reflexes to catch the cup, the scalding hot water inside would have burned Amelia's legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How come you're so distracted?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Gigi walked in, she could tell that something was off with Amelia. Not only had she lost a lot of weight, but her eyes were lifeless, like a shell without a soul, a walking corpse.</span></p></div>
