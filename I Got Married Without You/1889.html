        <h1>Chapter 1889 Just a blessing from your ex</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith accompanied Ryan, enduring difficult times, while Anthony hid in the background, watching as Edith slowly fell in love with Ryan. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that witnessing someone you love slowly fall in love with someone else, rather than simply falling out of love, was even more heart-wrenching. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially when she said it out loud, Anthony felt like he had been struck by a thousand arrows. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony leaned against the wall, turned his back, slowly raised his eyes to the sky, and felt that the world was still beautiful, but his heart was full of holes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Edith, I have prepared myself to silently stand by your side for a lifetime, on the condition that neither of us falls in love with someone else. But why did you break the only rule we had left?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed to forget that he had made this rule himself, unrelated to Edith, and would ultimately suffer the consequences of breaking it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony, unwilling to accept these consequences, raised his palm and pressed it against his heart, which was about to break, then slowly turned his head to look at Edith sitting next to Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, when he heartlessly left, Edith had raised three fingers and made a hysterical oath to the sky. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Anthony, remember this, I will completely forget you and fall in love with someone else again. When that day comes, you must not turn back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That deafening oath echoed in Anthony's heart countless times in the deep night, causing him unbearable pain that he couldn't forget. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was engraved in his mind until this day. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was afraid that the oath would come true, so he had stayed by her side all these years, fearing that she would fall in love with someone else. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when that day actually arrived, it was so painful. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony could accept that Edith didn't love him anymore, but he couldn't accept her falling in love with someone else, because it meant that he would have to watch the woman who once loved him dearly, love someone else in the future. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't allow him to turn back. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony wondered if Edith knew that this day would come, which was why she cut off his only path. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Separation in life and death, love that cannot be obtained, Anthony had experienced it all. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked into the delivery room like a walking corpse, holding the gift in his hand. "Paul, Eva, congratulations." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He congratulated them with a smile as if nothing had happened, but his pale face clearly showed his unbearable pain. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, as his friend, of course knew what Anthony had just heard Edith say. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as a friend, he pretended not to notice and pulled Anthony to see the baby, making jokes to divert Anthony's attention. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia hadn't even had a chance to respond to Edith's words before Anthony suddenly interrupted. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His arrival made it impossible to continue the conversation, so they turned their attention to James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, sitting next to them, didn't expect Edith to think that Ryan was not bad. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When adults say this, it means they want to develop further. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was obvious that Edith had thoughts, but... if Edith and Ryan ended up together, wouldn't Ryan become his and Amelia's brother-in-law? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't want to see this result, so he coldly glanced at Anthony, as if to say something without saying it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In order to break the awkwardness, Anthony played with the child for a while and then turned to face Edith. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard what you just said. Ryan is indeed not bad. If you like him... hold on to him." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith only thought that Ryan was not bad, she hadn't reached the point of liking him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when she saw the despair in Anthony's eyes, she suddenly remembered how she crawled in the mud. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The explanation on the tip of her tongue was swallowed back. "Thank you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony forced a bitter smile and showed a pale smile. "Just a blessing from your ex, no need to be so polite..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the two fell silent, and the delivery room fell into a deathly silence. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Paul quickly livened up the atmosphere, Edith felt uncomfortable and greeted them before leaving. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony, pretending to play with the child, secretly lifted his eyelashes and looked at Edith's back, filled with longing. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some reason, tears suddenly streamed down his face. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hot tears fell on the baby's clothes, leaving a small stain. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one saw the sadness and sorrow in his eyes, except for the baby who was always watching Anthony. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony concealed all his sadness and continued to play with the child until he saw Edith get into Ryan's car outside the French window... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, the mentally absent Anthony, under the gaze of the four people, stumbled out of the delivery room. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the years that followed, he relied on cigarettes, alcohol, and drugs to get through the </span><span>long time</span><span> of Edith falling in love with Ryan... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waited his whole life, but she never turned back.</span></p></div>
