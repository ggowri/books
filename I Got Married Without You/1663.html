        <h1>Chapter 1663 Elsie’s purpose</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elsie had been manipulating Kate all along, but now that her goal was achieved, she couldn't help but laugh coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt, aren't you afraid that Ms. Miller will find out about your threats and refuse to marry Paul?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether she marries Paul or not is none of my concern. I did all of this just to help my son."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These words only deepened the smile on Elsie's lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You calculated that I couldn't compete with a wealthy family like yours, so you dared to threaten me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that you know your place, do as I say--"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking a deep breath, Elsie bravely raised her chin as if facing death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, if you want to hear me say that he never slept with me, then he never slept with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Satisfied with the result, Kate let go of Elsie's chin and patted her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leave that line for Ms. Miller to hear."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate stood up, gracefully accepting the handkerchief handed to her by the bodyguard, and elegantly wiped her fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lock her up for now, clean up her face wounds, and when she's better, take her to see Ms. Miller."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, who had timed his return, entered the living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, where's Elsie?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate, with her back to Paul, discreetly threw the blood-stained handkerchief into the trash can.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've taken care of it. In three days, she'll go with us to see Ms. Miller and clear up the truth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Paul, who had been on edge, suddenly relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that even if he got drunk, he would never do something like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thank goodness he hadn't slept with Elsie, or he would never forgive himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three days later, Elsie was escorted onto a private plane and appeared in front of Eva.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, who was still taking care of Ryan, stared blankly at Elsie, who was crying incessantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, that night, after I dropped Paul off at home, I saw you come looking for him. Out of jealousy, I deliberately staged a scene. In reality... Paul had fallen asleep and knew nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I heard you come in, I quickly used the blanket to block your view. When you didn't leave and I was afraid you would come over, I intentionally pinched Paul's waist. That's when he screamed in pain..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After revealing the truth, Elsie raised her tearful eyes and looked at Eva with envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I always thought I was Paul's first love, and I wanted to start again with him using that identity. But I didn't expect that his heart only belonged to you. Seeing him suffer because of the misunderstanding I deliberately created, I realized he would never love me again..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words added another layer of authenticity to her explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling confused, Eva glanced at Elsie, who seemed to have an epiphany, and then at Paul, who looked innocent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The memory of that night came rushing back, still vivid, but Elsie's explanation matched the details. For a moment, Eva couldn't tell if what she saw was real or if Elsie's words were true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she remained silent, Paul walked up to her, lifted his hands, and grabbed her shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he touched her, Eva instinctively pushed his hands away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that the shadow from that night hadn't been erased by Elsie's explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul withdrew his hand, frozen in mid-air, and kept a suitable distance from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, believe me, I really didn't have a relationship with her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paul, I've already said what needed to be said. I'll leave now. I wish you both happiness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Elsie left, but before getting into the car, she turned around and glanced at the two of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the quiet corridor, Paul stared at Eva for a long time before suddenly pulling out a diamond ring and kneeling in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, I haven't slept with Elsie, and my mother has agreed to us being together. Will you accept my proposal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still dressed in her nurse's uniform, Eva felt a bit overwhelmed by Paul's proposal in this setting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't do this in the hospital..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to help Paul up, but he grabbed her hand and forcefully placed the egg-sized diamond ring on her finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I promise you, aside from work-related obligations, from now on, I won't attend any social events involving alcohol. Even if it's a company party, I won't touch a drop of alcohol."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After giving his assurance, Paul took out his phone and in front of Eva, left the chat group formed by his playboy friends, one by one deleting them and even blocking their phone numbers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After completing all of this, he looked up again at Eva, who was still in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I promise </span><span>you,</span><span> I will leave my previous social circle and have no contact with any women."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having said that, Paul held Eva's hand tightly and sincerely asked once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marry me, please?"</span></p></div>
