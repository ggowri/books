        <h1>Chapter 1922 Ryan hit James</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Amelia like this, Johnny felt immense regret.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had known she would end up like this, he should have told her the words she asked him with her lips before she died. He should have told her without hesitation!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny hated himself for being cowardly and for keeping his distance, but compared to the pain Amelia was going through, these were insignificant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were just small regrets. Now, if he could, he would beg the heavens to let him take her place so that Amelia could live happily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, no one would care if Johnny lived or died, but Amelia was different.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was the hope of many people: James, Eva, Grace, their newborn son, and many others who cared about her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny pleaded in his heart for the heavens to let him trade places with Amelia. As he did, a man in a black coat, soaked in rain, got out of a car and hurriedly walked towards him, his steps slightly disordered but fast.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Ryan arrived at the hospital, Amelia had already been transferred to the intensive care unit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James held her hand and stayed by her side, never leaving.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone thought Amelia would never wake up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After spending a day and night outside the ICU, everyone left one by one, except for James who remained hopeful.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed that Amelia was just lost and once she found her way, she would come back home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sent Andrew and Peter all over the world to find the best doctors, firmly believing that miracles could happen.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan didn't see the bloody Amelia, but through the glass of the ICU, he saw James, pale-faced, holding Amelia's hand tightly, staring at the person lying on the hospital bed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he received Edith's message, he was still overseas getting his leg checked. He rushed back in a panic, only to be told that Amelia had fallen into a deep coma and the chances of her waking up were slim.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought that as long as he didn't have any contact with her, as long as the person he once loved was doing well, everything would be fine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who could have imagined that after cutting off contact, her situation would turn out like this?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan sometimes wondered if he hadn't rejected Amelia back then and had instead married her, would she have had to go through so much suffering?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan regretted it a bit and opened the door to the ICU, taking heavy steps towards James.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't look at James, his slightly red gaze fixed on the pale, small face without any trace of blood...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He moved his fingers that were by his side and then let go of all the restraint and control, extending his slender fingers to touch Amelia's face...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before his fingertips could touch her deeply missed face, they were pushed away by a palm. "Don't touch her!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's eyes were filled with possessiveness, even more so than before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan didn't know if this action angered James, but he clenched his fingers into a fist and punched James!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I gave her to you so you could take care of her, but what happened?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan grabbed James's collar with one hand and pointed at Amelia lying unconscious on the hospital bed with the other.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, filled with a cold aura, followed Ryan's finger and looked at Amelia. "You're right, it's my fault, I didn't take care of her, but..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James raised his proud chin, staring at Ryan with disdainful eyes. "What right do you have to say that to me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..." Ryan was left speechless by the cold retort.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, what right did he have? When they were together, he hesitated to marry Amelia, and when they were apart, he didn't dare to marry her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that she was someone else's wife, what right and position did he have to condemn her husband?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The family disputes, his shares, his parents' grudges, all of them were resolved by Amelia's husband.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of all this, Ryan accepted his fate and let go of his fist.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James should have punched him back, but he willingly took the blow.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was because Ryan was right, he hadn't taken care of Amelia, which led to her current state.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan released James and the two tall men distanced themselves from each other. They stood in front of the hospital bed without saying a word, until time passed little by little, and Ryan finally spoke. "I will find a doctor to wake Amelia up." Ryan knew that staying here, reminiscing about the past or longing for Amelia, was not the right thing to do.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For two people who were separated, not contacting each other regularly but extending a helping hand in times of crisis was the best thing to do.</span></p></div>
