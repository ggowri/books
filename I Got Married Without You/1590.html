        <h1>Chapter 1590 Stella faked to be fine</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erin's ashes were brought back to the country by the Thomas family. According to news from Imperial Capital, Karen treated this stepson with genuine affection. Thomas angrily criticized Erin for bringing shame to the family and refused to hold a grand funeral. Karen argued with Thomas, saying that even if Erin had a bad reputation, he was still part of the Simpson family and deserved a grand funeral.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Thomas was unable to resist Karen's insistence and handed over the funeral arrangements to her. People who came to pay their respects from the Simpson family said that Karen knelt in front of Erin's portrait and cried hysterically, almost fainting. People in the Imperial Capital circle spread rumors that Karen was the best stepmother and Erin was an ungrateful stepson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Stella heard these rumors, she was injecting medication and continued her actions without pause, showing no significant change in expression. It seemed that she had no emotional attachment to the deceased person and simply brushed it off as background noise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After returning from Panama and arranging for Henry to be hospitalized for recovery, Stella took care of him while still working her regular job without missing a beat, just as she did before. Initially, Amelia and Eva were worried that Stella would be excessively saddened by Erin's death. However, to their surprise, as soon as she returned, she put on her white coat and started working. Whether Erin was mentioned or not, she had a cheerful demeanor. It seemed that Erin's absence was a relief to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella told them that they didn't have to deliberately avoid mentioning Erin in front of her. Without his presence, she no longer had to live in fear. That's why she didn't even attend the funeral or inquire about where Erin was buried. Amelia and Eva saw her like this and didn't ask much further. They only instructed her to reach out to them if she needed anything. They promised to help her whenever she needed it. Stella nodded and let them go about their own business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia had to rush to work on her design plans, and Eva had to manage the night club. They were both busy, and Stella had already caused them enough trouble during this time. Naturally, she wouldn't have them worry further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After flicking the syringe, Stella bent down, smiling and comforting a child while secretly giving the child an injection when they weren't paying attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The child initially smiled at her, but when she removed the syringe, the child burst into tears. The parents nearby comforted the child, and Stella smiled as she patted the child's head. She even performed a magic trick, pulling out a lollipop from her pocket and handing it to the child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The child took the lollipop and not only stopped crying but also behaved obediently, saying thank you. Stella once again patted the child's head before leaving the ward with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once she left the ward, her smile suddenly froze, and the world spun around her. She quickly reached out and grabbed the wall, trembling fingers feeling for her white coat, searching for her medication bottle...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her mind, she flashed images of shooting Erin and Erin slumped against the floor-to-ceiling window, blood flowing from his body. These gruesome images caused her to feel on the verge of a breakdown, and she had to rely on medication to forget them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finding the medication bottle, she poured out a pill, trembling as she placed it in her mouth and swallowed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking the pill, she leaned against the wall, waiting for her emotions to calm down. A doctor approached her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Director, are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this period, she had been working tirelessly, helping out in neurosurgery, internal medicine, and anything else that needed assistance. Now she even personally came to the children's department.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella waved her hand, telling the doctor to focus on their own tasks, and then she mustered up her tired body and returned to Henry's room.</span></p></div>
