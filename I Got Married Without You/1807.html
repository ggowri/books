        <h1>Chapter 1807 You’re beyond help</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gigi, I don't look down on Zack, and neither does James. He considered Zack as a brother, he..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he considered Zack as a brother, would he send him to die?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James went to Erebus, and the first person he kept it from was Zack. He didn't want to involve him, so why would he intentionally send him to die?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing Amelia's explanation, Gigi couldn't listen, and her emotions, which had just calmed down, flared up again. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up, I don't want to hear your excuses anymore, you're all in this together!" "Gigi..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Amelia could finish her sentence, Gigi, in a fit of madness, got up and rushed over. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, before Paul could intervene or Johnny could stop her, a mature and steady figure rushed in. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the figure came in, he quickly raised his hand and slapped Gigi hard across the face. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Samuel's slap, Gigi immediately lost her balance and fell to the ground. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt a sharp pain in her lower abdomen, and something was flowing out, but she didn't react, just staring blankly at him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Samuel hit her, he didn't notice that she was bleeding. Instead, he looked down at her with anger. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You secretly dated that bodyguard named Zack and got pregnant with his child. Yet, you're still acting crazy for a dead man!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's not dead!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi, with a burst of strength, pushed Johnny, who was trying to help her up, and clenched her fists, shouting at Samuel. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zack isn't dead, he's alive and well. I won't allow you to curse him like that!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this time, Gigi's illness had been recurring, and Samuel had been by her side day and night, taking care of her, but the result... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're beyond help!" Samuel, feeling extremely exhausted, reached out to grab Gigi's arm to pull her back, but in her struggle, Gigi accidentally slapped him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the first time that Samuel, who had been in a high position, had been hit by his own child. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face suddenly darkened, but he didn't raise his hand again, just looked at her with a pained expression. "Do you know that because of your crazy behavior over a man, many families are mocking you behind your back? How will you ever get married?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Gigi suddenly regained her composure and stopped struggling. "Dad, in your eyes, is my value only in a business marriage?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel's heart sank. "You are my daughter, you should marry the best man, not a bodyguard. Now that he's dead, it's for the best. Even if he were alive, I would never let you be with him." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the end for Gigi and Zack. They couldn't be together in life or in death. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi hugged herself tightly, sitting on the ground and laughing bitterly. "You are truly </span><span>great..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mocked by her own daughter, Samuel felt very uncomfortable. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed Gigi's shoulder and lifted her up from the ground. "If you embarrass yourself outside again, I'll lock you up!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Gigi was being lifted up, Johnny noticed the blood on the ground and his face suddenly turned pale. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gigi, didn't you feel the bleeding? Why didn't you say anything?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi followed Johnny's gaze and looked at her lower body. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she touched the blood, she finally reacted slowly. "Brother, I'm in too much pain, I didn't feel it." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She grabbed Johnny's arm, tears streaming down her face. "This is Zack's only child. Don't let this child die. Help me, brother, please help me..."</span></p></div>
