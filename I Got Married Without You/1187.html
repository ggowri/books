        <h1>Chapter 1187 Sometimes, Dominic also regrets (2)</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of the scene where the fire was blazing, Dominic felt suffocated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These tragedies were all caused by him. He was sorry to his eldest son Nate, sorry to the Clark family's daughter, and also sorry to Gloria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sometimes, he also regretted it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He should have found a way to keep the identity of the C</span><span>lark</span><span> family's daughter hidden and let them be together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wouldn't have led to his son's death, but it was too late for regrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>J</span><span>ames</span><span>, who had </span><span>little</span><span> empathy, didn't have much feeling after hearing this. He only had one question, "What about Adam's illegitimate daughter? Did she have a child?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>D</span><span>ominic</span><span> slowly put away his regretful expression and looked at J</span><span>ames</span><span>, who had no expression on his face, and sighed, "You've grown up and become an outstanding person, a pride of heaven."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>J</span><span>ames</span><span> wasn't interested in what he had become and only asked, "Where is he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I</span><span>t was natural to be curious about having a half-brother out of nowhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After staring at him for a while, D</span><span>ominic</span><span> revealed a long-hidden secret, "He's sitting across from me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>J</span><span>ames</span><span>'s previously nonchalant face suddenly stiffened, "What did you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>D</span><span>ominic</span><span> put down his crossed legs and said seriously, "Gloria was never pregnant. She waited until the C</span><span>lark</span><span> family's daughter gave birth and then sent that child back to the Leinster family. When it was time for her own delivery, she brought you over and said you were her own child. Even I was kept in the dark about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for Carol accidentally seeing her mistreat you and becoming suspicious, telling me about it, I'm afraid no one would know this secret. When I asked her why she did it, she said it was to retaliate against your father and told me not to interfere in this matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>You have half of the blood of the Clark family in you. Every time I see you, I am reminded of the Evans family who were killed by the Clark family. And, it was indeed me who forced your father to marry Gloria, who I owe an apology to. I let her take her emotions out on you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Gloria treated him that way. It turns out he wasn't even her biological </span><span>child. But, "I did a DNA test..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sent his own people to do the test, so it couldn't have been faked. But Dominic said, "I switched the results. If anyone found out that you were not from the Evans family, but rather the stillborn child of the Clark family, do you think you would still be alive today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, he survived because Gloria wanted to take revenge on his father. Otherwise, he would have died a long time ago.</span></p></div>
