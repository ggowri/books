        <h1>Chapter 1671 I’m the baby’s father</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Believe me, whether it's Elsie, Kayla, Camilla, or any other woman, I've cut ties with all of them. This kind of situation will never happen again." He promised that even if other women pursued him, he would stay far away and even wear a mask when he goes out. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva shook her head as she looked at Paul's sincere explanation and solemn promise. "But I don't believe you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She always felt defeated by the women around Paul when it came to building trust. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Currently, she only received Paul's assurances but didn't feel completely safe. It was hard for her to trust him and she didn't want to repeatedly choose to believe, only to experience disappointment again and again. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, stunned in place by her lack of trust, looked at Eva for a while before speaking coldly. "So, are you still going to have an abortion?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva lowered her eyelashes and didn't answer, but her silence was taken as consent by Paul. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, I really want to open up your heart and see what's inside." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if the misunderstanding was resolved, she was still so heartless, which meant </span><span>she didn't really love him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about this, it was painful for Paul to even breathe. The pain gripping his heart made him slowly release Eva. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if I die, I won't look at you again." After saying this, he took a step back, his eyes bloodshot, staring at Eva before turning and leaving. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His figure disappeared behind the operating room, and Eva, leaning on the nearby surgical table, slowly squatted down. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mandy, outside the ward, saw Paul leave in anger and quickly pushed open the door and walked in. "Eva." Mandy crouched down and put her hand on Eva's shoulder. "After all, it's a life. Don't have an abortion just because you're in conflict with Paul." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva hugged her knees tightly, burying her head in her arms, her endless exhaustion and pain tightly enveloping her. "Mandy, am I not brave enough?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mandy looked at Eva, who was curled up in front of her, opened her arms, and hugged her. "Actually, compared to other heirs, Paul is already good enough. It's just that your experiences have made you unable to trust him completely." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mandy gently patted her back. "I understand you, but Eva, life is only a few decades and it passes by in the blink of an eye." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had her own opinions about Paul at first too. Since he and Eva were dating, he should have announced their relationship seriously, but he never dared to admit it at the time. Just from this, Mandy didn't think highly of Paul. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after the incident with Jayden, Mandy realized that appearances can be deceiving and what's inside is more important. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Paul was a playboy, he had a good heart. He was just young, and his way of doing things wasn't as mature and stable, but people will always grow. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva, give Paul some time to change, and give yourself some time to build trust. During this period, don't be irrational and have an abortion, so you won't regret it later." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Eva was still hesitating, Paul suddenly rushed in. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't care about their reactions and directly bent down to pick up Eva. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After carrying her out of the hospital and putting her in the car, he took out an agreement and handed it to her. "Marry me. If you're willing to keep the child after it's born, then stay. If not, you can leave anytime. The deadline is one year." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The meaning behind his words was that he only wanted the child. Because of a few words from Mandy and Eva's wavering, Paul became determined. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't give birth to this child." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul squeezed the hand holding the agreement, exerting force suddenly. "I'm the child's father, and I have half the right to decide its fate." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After forcefully saying this, he grabbed Eva's hand and forced her to sign. "Now, whether to give birth or not is not up to you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul put away the agreement and quickly started the car. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, sitting in the passenger seat, turned her head to angrily stare at him. "Paul, can't you respect me?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have already respected you enough, but what did I get in return?" Paul, equally resentful, glanced at Eva. "The child in your belly is mine. Why do you think you can </span><span>just decide to have an abortion?" He should have been happy about having a child, but he didn't feel any joy of becoming a father. He was just filled with anger. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me tell you, Eva, whether you like it or not, I will make sure this child is born healthy!" The firm emotion in his eyes left Eva stunned. She had never seen him like this before and didn't know how to respond. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul quickly </span><span>drove</span><span> to Eva's home, parked the car, and directly opened the passenger door. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bent down to pick her up and brought her into her master bedroom. "Let's get married now."</span></p></div>
