        <h1>Chapter 1964 Hanging up the Last Call</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trial was over, which meant Anthony and Edith could no longer see each other. Standing in the courtroom, his hands braced against the lawyer's desk, Anthony looked over the bustling crowd at Edith rising to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lips parted, longing to shout, "Edith, it's our last meeting. Let's say goodbye." But no sound emerged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, Anthony collapsed, falling in his beloved courtroom with no regrets. Except that the woman he deeply loved had never once looked back at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Struggling to hold on, Anthony was hospitalized, his body riddled with tubes, yet he instructed his student not to tell Edith. His student tried to reason with him, asking why he endured this. Gazing at the bleak sky outside his window, Anthony replied, "I pushed her away first. How can I expect her to look back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when the doctors informed Anthony that he had only three days left to live, he removed the tubes, summoning the strength to dress in a clean suit, shave his beard, and had his student drive him to Edith's studio.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith, lost in the depths of her design, had toiled through several sleepless nights, her passion culminating in a masterpiece of artistry. However, the relentless exertion had taken its toll, leaving her sprawled across the wooden table in a deep slumber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Anthony entered the workshop, the other craftsmen instinctively rose and departed, leaving him a private space. Their gratitude for his legal victory in their favor had fueled their desire to unite him with Edith, unaware that Anthony had no time for such matchmaking endeavors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sun graced the day with its warm embrace, casting a golden glow upon Edith's slumbering form. In stark contrast stood Anthony, enveloped in the shadows, a stark symbol of their contrasting fates. One, a child of the sun, forever basking in its radiant warmth, the other, a captive of the underworld, forever shrouded in darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone who thrives in the light shouldn't mingle with one who dwells in hell. Even though Edith fell in love with someone else and was rejected. Anthony never had the chance to hold her hand again, to fulfill the youthful promise of growing old together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He really didn't want to let go of Edith, each sighting making him want to cry, but he couldn't do anything with only three days left to live. Like a fool, he stood by the wooden table, staring at the sleeping Edith...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing this was their final encounter, Anthony mustered his courage, unable to longer contain his emotions. He approached Edith, drawn by the warmth of the sun that enveloped them both. Leaning in like a thief, he slowly drew closer to her face, his lips descending towards hers, gently planting a kiss upon her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he kissed her, Edith had already awakened. Usually, she should have opened her eyes and slapped Anthony, but for some reason, she did not. Instead, she pretended to be asleep, keeping her eyes closed...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Years had passed since Anthony last held Edith, yet the lightest touch sent a surge of raw emotion coursing through him. His eyes welled with unshed tears, threatening to spill over, but he dared not let out a sound, fearing to disturb her slumber. Reluctantly, he pulled away from her soft lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he prepared to leave, a warm tear escaped his control, tracing a path down Edith's cheek. Her eyelashes fluttered, hinting at an awakening, and Anthony hastily rose, his heart pounding, and retreated into the shadows, leaving behind the warmth of her embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet he didn't leave. He lingered outside the door, planning to act nonchalant when Edith emerged, teasingly telling her, "The lawsuit is over, and you didn't even invite me for a meal to say thanks. So, I guess I'll invite myself over for one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he waited a long time, and Edith never came out. Inside, she thought about getting up, but ultimately, she resisted and just touched her cheek and the lips that Anthony had kissed...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't quite understand her feelings, only knowing that she didn't dislike his kiss. She couldn't figure it out because they had done this so many times before, it was just as a habit or deep down, she had never really forgotten Anthony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith was confused, wanting to sort out her feelings before seeing Anthony again. However, before she could, she received a call from him the night he kissed her. Anthony told her over the phone that his stomach ulcer had flared up, asking her to come to the apartment across from hers to help him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Learning that Anthony had quietly moved in across from her and had been there for years, Edith was furious. "Didn't you promise never to disturb or see me again? Why are you living right across from my house?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the night, with his shirt stained red with blood against the white sofa, Anthony strained a smile and whispered an apology, "Edith, I'm sorry. I guess I missed you too much, so I couldn't help but move across from you. Can you forgive me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His plea for forgiveness wasn't about moving across her place, but Edith misunderstood, replying coldly, "You're like a stalker, living right across from my house. How could I ever forgive you? Dream on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angry, she hung up on Anthony's last call. Later, a regretful Edith tried countless times to call him back, but no one ever answered again, nor did anyone whisper apologies to her over the phone...</span></p></div>
