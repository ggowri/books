        <h1>Chapter 1808 Gigi's baby was gone</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny, regardless of his own injuries, quickly bent down and picked up Gigi. "I'll take you to find a doctor." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Find a doctor, and let the doctor perform an abortion on this child." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel's words were more painful to Gigi than his slap. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her father was afraid that her having a child would affect a business alliance. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, her parents didn't really love her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring Samuel, Johnny swiftly rushed out of the hospital room with Gigi in his arms. After they left, Samuel turned around and looked at Amelia, whose face was covered in burns. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had promised Johnny to find Amelia because he had learned from Johnny that she was </span><span>Sumasa's</span><span> daughter. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he found her on the deserted island, he had thought she was </span><span>Sumasa</span><span> and had been lost in a daze for a while, but Samuel was very rational and didn't have much emotional change. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, </span><span>Sumasa</span><span> was just someone he had loved in his youth, and after so many years, even if there was lingering affection, it was all in the past. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel collected his thoughts, looked away from Amelia, and left the hospital room. After they left, Eva picked up the ointment left by the doctor and continued to apply it to Amelia. "How could Gigi take her anger out on you?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva was more concerned about Amelia than sympathetic to Gigi. "She's been under a lot of stress, and once she's better, she won't be like this." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Amelia didn't blame Gigi, Eva sighed and didn't complain anymore. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia then looked at Paul, who was standing nearby. "Paul, please go check on Gigi for me. I'm worried about her baby..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul didn't want to go, but he still left the hospital room. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long time, Johnny returned with Paul. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Amelia's face covered in ointment, Johnny immediately showed concern for her. "How are you feeling? Are you still in pain?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting by the bed, Amelia shook her head and asked about Gigi's baby. "The baby didn't make it." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia and Eva were both stunned, especially Amelia, who suddenly felt a surge of </span><span>guilt. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not your fault, my father was too forceful." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the doctor told Johnny that the baby hadn't survived, he didn't know how to feel. He just felt that Zack had taken the baby away to give Gigi a fresh start. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, his sister was still very young, and there was a long road ahead in her life, so Zack wouldn't want her to stop here. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But... his sister's fate was not good. She had a love affair, lost the person she loved the most, and lost her first child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was quite tragic. Amelia couldn't bear to imagine how devastated Gigi must be at this moment. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt a deep sense of pain and tears flowed down her cheeks. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva hugged Amelia's shoulder, trying to comfort her, but could only occasionally wipe away the tears from her eyes with a tissue. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Blame my father, it's because my father didn't want her to keep the baby, so he didn't consider her health and took such drastic measures." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before they returned, Gigi had already had several episodes of bleeding, and Samuel knew she was weak, but he still did it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny had seen through his parents, and his eyes were full of disappointment, but he also felt tired because he couldn't save Gigi's child. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, your eyes are not good, don't cry." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After comforting her, he looked at Eva. "Eva, please take care of her. I'll go be with my sister." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva nodded, and Johnny walked out of the hospital room with heavy steps. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After crying for a while, Amelia's lower abdomen also began to ache. Eva was frightened and quickly called the doctor again. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor warned her to control her emotions, otherwise the child would not survive. Amelia caressed her lower abdomen, turned to the side, looked out the window, and felt a heart-wrenching pain that made it difficult to breathe. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zack was dead, Gigi's baby was gone, and become abnormal. How could she atone for her sins?</span></p></div>
