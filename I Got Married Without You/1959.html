        <h1>Chapter 1959 Part Ways Eventually</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Jocelyn was buried, Amelia took Grace to visit Skender's grave. When they walked to the grave, it started to drizzle. James, waiting outside the cemetery, took out a black umbrella, locked Alexander in the car, and went into the cemetery alone to hold an umbrella for the two of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander put one hand on the edge of the window, wearing an angry look. When he had the chance to visit Skender's grave next time, he had to run quickly so that James couldn't stop him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After visiting Skender's and Aaron's graves, Amelia and Grace went to Clatan to visit Stella. Amelia would come to visit her grave on her death anniversary every year. When Alexander was two years old, Amelia took him with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Alexander was five years old and accustomed to the worship process. He placed the chrysanthemums, touched Stella's portrait, and bowed. Then, when James wasn't paying attention, he turned around and ran away. But before he could get far, James grabbed him by his collar and pulled him back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pulled a long face. When Henry saw that, he touched Alexander's head and asked, "After the worship, I will take you to the study and teach you some medical knowledge, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quite liked to stay in Clatan, mainly because there was Henry, who could teach him medical knowledge. Even though Alexander was young and didn't understand much, he showed great interest and always asked Henry to talk more. Therefore, hearing Henry would take him to the study, he calmed down and behaved himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was not talkative. He would only say a few words patiently when he met someone or something that interested him. He would treat others with disdain, but he could learn what he wanted to learn from everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander paid attention to Herb's gambling skills, Johnny's ability to manage his subordinates, Dylan's marksmanship, Paul's computer skills, Henry's medical skills, and Andrew and Peter's fighting skills. However, because of his young age, he could only get inspired and had no ability to master those skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could see the good sides of the people around him, but he couldn't see James' abilities. He only knew that everyone was afraid of James. However, in Alexander's eyes, apart from hugging and kissing Amelia everywhere at home and trying every possible way to get rid of him so that he could share a bed alone with Amelia, James didn't have any special skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't be a crazy kisser like James, so he could only pretend to be uncomfortable to separate James and Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this trick only worked at night. During the day, Alexander was usually under James' control. Only at night could Alexander be dominative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sat cross-legged on the carpet in the study. Henry sat opposite him with a medical book. He flipped through the book while explaining theories. Occasionally, Alexander had a question and would interrupt Henry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The knowledge he couldn't understand was all quite tricky, which reminded Henry of Erin. It was said that Erin was like that when he was a child. He could discover existing problems in medicine at a young age, which was an ability that a genius possessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Henry looked at the five-year-old Alexander and couldn't help but touch his head. "Alexander, you are so smart. You will become a genius doctor like Erin when you grow up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander would respect those he thought were capable. Even though he was not used to his head being touched, he endured it and said, "I don't want to be a doctor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprised, Henry raised the book and asked, "You're asking me to teach you medical knowledge. Aren't you interested in healing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shook his head and shook off Henry's hand. He pretended to be nonchalant and said, "They are not my families. Why should I heal and save them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was cold on the outside, while Alexander was cold-blooded inside, which made Henry suspect that Alexander had violent tendencies. "So, what kind of person do you want to be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander frowned at Henry, saying, "I'm who I am. Why do I have to become a certain kind of person when I grow up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His question baffled Henry. It was impossible for Alexander, who had a lot of personality and was smart, to be violent. He was just more indifferent to people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Henry could understand Alexander, so he stopped asking him such useless questions. Instead, he picked up the book and taught Alexander all the theories that he could understand using the most straightforward language.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every year on Stella's death anniversary, Amelia and her family would come to Clatan and stay there for a while. Henry would enthusiastically entertain them, take Alexander to play on the island, and teach him how to row a boat. After they spent so much time together, the saddest thing was the parting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After helping Amelia get on the ship, James carried Alexander on his shoulders. He then turned his body slightly to let Alexander wave goodbye to Henry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the ship going away, Henry waved his arm in farewell with tears. No matter how reluctant they were, sometimes, they were destined to part ways eventually.</span></p></div>
