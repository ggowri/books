        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paul, I'm sorry, James just isn't very good with words," Amelia replied, </span><span>blamingly</span><span>, glancing at James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why don't you go back first, and I'll stay here and spend time with the two little ones." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, who was already sitting on the couch, raised his slightly melancholic eyes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll stay with you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It meant that if Amelia didn't leave, he wouldn't either. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's pleading eyes shifted back to Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia sighed, reluctant to leave, and handed the baby back to Kate. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking the baby from Amelia, Kate suddenly realized that the baby did indeed look a bit ugly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She furrowed her brows, looking at the baby, then at Paul and Eva. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their parents weren't ugly, so why was the baby so ugly? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Kate looked, the uglier the baby seemed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She simply handed the baby back to Amelia and said, "You're the baby's aunt, so you should stay and hold them more." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, who had taken the baby back, happily held it in her arms and said, "Then I'll hold them a little longer and go home later." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the entire delivery room, Amelia was probably the only one who found the baby cute, while everyone else thought it was ugly, but no one expressed their opinion. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With one hand holding the baby, and the other gently touching the baby's head, Amelia said to Paul, "Paul, children are usually not very good-looking when they're young, but they become more beautiful as they grow up. </span><span>So</span><span> you and Eva don't need to worry." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's words were heartwarming, and Paul immediately relaxed his brows and eyes. "Of course, with how good-looking Eva and I are, our baby will definitely become more and more beautiful!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, who was supporting his chin with one hand, raised an eyebrow upon hearing this, and was about to say something, but Paul interrupted him, "James, if it's not something nice to say, then don't say it!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James shifted his gaze to Amelia's face and saw her giving him a 'stern' look as a warning, so he swallowed the 'nice and kind' words that were about to come out of his mouth. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere in the delivery room became lively again as everyone started choosing suitable names for the babies. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, after Eva and Paul made their selection, they settled on 'Maxwell' and 'Margot'. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the chosen names were successful, James ended up with the nickname 'Ken' given by Rebecca, and the names 'Ken' and 'Barbie' quickly spread within the Evans family circle. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the future, people would forget the names Maxwell and Margot, and only remember Ken and Barbie from Paul's family. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Paul very angry, so he came up with a bunch of unpleasant names for </span><span>James' child and sent one to the group chat every day, but unfortunately, no one cared. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul could only hope that his child would surpass James' child in terms of looks, academics, talents, intelligence, and every aspect possible! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Amelia saw off Dominic, Eric, Kate, and Rebecca, she still couldn't bear to let go of the baby in her arms. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She held the baby while consulting the childcare expert Paul had hired on how to take care of the baby. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James had been impatiently waiting, but seeing how much Amelia loved the baby, he patiently sat next to her and watched Paul post on social media. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul proudly edited the polished baby photos and captioned them: "[My two little treasures.]" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, many people liked and commented, all with well-wishes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A gentle voice came from outside, "Congratulations, bro!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia followed the voice and saw Edith, followed by... Ryan.</span></p></div>
