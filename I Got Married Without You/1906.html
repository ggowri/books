        <h1>Chapter 1906 Not Suitable for Life</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Amelia fell, James had just returned home. Because he found her in time, they were able to get to the hospital promptly, preventing any major issues. Amelia woke up as soon as they arrived at the hospital, but James, still worried, insisted on arranging a full-body check-up for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia had been constantly on the go, even after getting pregnant. She hadn't had a proper medical check-up, only a brief prenatal examination, and that too wasn't scheduled regularly. She hadn't thoroughly investigated her current physical condition as a pregnant woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Amelia fainted and fell before she could even take a bath. It wasn't due to a lack of oxygen from bathing too long, and it was unclear what caused it. James was very worried and knew he had to thoroughly check her condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the dean finished his inspection, he went on to review the medical records. Seeing that Amelia had undergone major surgeries, more than once, even had a heart transplant, and still had issues with her eyes, he couldn't help but shudder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the case of Amelia, if she hadn't developed sudden pregnancy-induced hypertension, she could have sought out a skilled doctor for proper care and attentive nurturing. Perhaps she could have found a way to pull through during childbirth. But with her current condition, </span><span>she's simply not suitable for a normal delivery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was hesitating about how to tell James when a call came in. It was old Mr. Evans. He had seen James bring an unconscious Amelia to the hospital and, fearing James might find out something, he ordered the hospital director to keep it from both of them. He wanted Amelia to have the baby first before anything else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, the Dean immediately guessed that old Mr. Evans had known all along that Amelia's delivery would be risky. He was at a loss for words, "Old Mr. Evans, your daughter-in-law's health is really poor. Now she's developed preeclampsia. If we insist on a normal delivery, it could cost her life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Dean's skills, the child could have been saved through a cesarean section. However, the mother's life wasn't guaranteed. Severe bleeding, coupled with various complications, could indeed have cost the mother her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Old Mr. Evans coldly said, "It's been over seven months now. She's already pregnant, and an abortion would be risky. It's better to wait until after the baby is born, then think about treatment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What the Dean meant was that he feared that before they could even start treatment, the mother could suffer from massive bleeding and die on the operating table. But clearly, old Mr. Evans didn't care about the mother's life or death at all. He only wanted to save the child in her womb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This situation was quite tricky for the Dean. Old Mr. Evans was Mr. Evans' grandfather, a senior figure whom she couldn't afford to offend. However, she was well aware that the one who held the reins in the Evans family now was Mr. Evans, not old Mr. Evans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After weighing the pros and cons, and thinking it over for a long time, the Dean decided to tell Mr. Evans about this matter. Even if old Mr. Evans retaliated afterward, as a doctor, she couldn't go against her conscience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After consulting with the experts, she handed the decision over to James: "Mr. Evans, after the examination report came out, I invited experts from the hospital to evaluate it. We all agree that your wife's body is not suitable for having children."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man, flipping through the medical report, paused, lifting his icy gaze to the group of doctors across from him. "What does this mean?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's icy gaze was oppressive. The doctors didn't dare to meet the eyes of such a formidable presence, instinctively lowering their heads. Only the hospital director, bearing the pressure, explained, "What we mean is, there's a risk to her life during childbirth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words "life-threatening" struck James' heart like a sudden storm, causing the well-dressed man to freeze on the spot as if turned into a statue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After staring at the Dean for a long time, James was so angry that he crumpled the report in his hand into a ball. "Before she got pregnant, your teacher said she could give birth. Now you're telling me she's not fit to give birth. If your medical skills are not up to par, then get out of my sight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dean's mentor was a renowned authority in Obstetrics and Gynecology. With such a mentor, it was no surprise that the Dean's medical skills were top-notch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The one at fault here was the teacher who, despite knowing the situation, still chose to help old Mr. Evans conceal it from the patient.So, when faced with James' questioning and anger, the dean didn't argue about medical skills but simply gave a gentle reminder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Evans, your wife is capable of giving birth, but there's a significant risk involved during the delivery. I believe my teacher must have mentioned this risk factor to you before, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dean and Stella were both students of the same teacher. The issues they couldn't see at the time, the teacher surely could. Yet, the teacher didn't say anything. It was really a matter of medical ethics.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the dean's reminder, James quickly understood the reason. His face changed </span><span>dramatically, like a storm, becoming extremely horrifying. The report he held in his hand was about to be crushed into pieces.</span></p></div>
