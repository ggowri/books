        <h1>Chapter 1869 Breaking into Erebus</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hesitating for a moment, some of the operatives chose to stay while others chose to leave. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of those who stayed had deep grudges against the S organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, half of the people in the control room left, leaving the rest standing by. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What should we do now, boss?" one of the operatives asked. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty looked at the operatives who stayed and knew that this strategy of retreating to advance was effective. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finished his last cigarette, raised his eyes filled with killing intent, and scanned the room. "Return to your respective control areas. Activate the shooting program in the </span><span>area where the S members are located," he commanded. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir," the operatives responded and left the control room. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Matty got up and went to the biochemistry area. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He activated the explosive chip system and started working on it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, surrounded by electronic devices, saw someone trying to shorten the detonation time and quickly intervened. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two engaged in a fierce battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, James and the S members had already entered Zone A and headed straight for it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The operatives who were ready to activate the shooting program saw the man on the monitor suddenly retreat after cracking the door, leaving them puzzled. "What does he mean by this?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that he guessed we have a shooting program and is afraid to come in?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The operatives in charge of Zone A were confused and looked at each other. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Regardless of whether he dares to come in or not, we must shoot them!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lewis from Group 1 spoke up, and the operatives in front of the control panel immediately adjusted the shooting range. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, James didn't give them any time to adjust. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He simply raised his slender finger and pressed it forward. "Group 1, front corridor, upper left, 10 o'clock direction, fire!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following James' command, several S members holding grenades quickly moved forward, aimed at the 10 o'clock direction, pulled the pins, and threw them with force. "Boom!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The earth-shattering explosion instantly destroyed the shooting program hidden behind the white wall. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, James' cold voice resounded again. "Group 2, front corridor, upper right, 3 o'clock direction, fire!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As members of Group 1 retreated, members of Group 2 quickly took their place. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The coordination between the two teams was seamless. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Group 2 threw their bombs, Group 3 took over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After several rounds of bombing, the long corridors in Zone A collapsed, affecting even the surveillance cameras. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surveillance footage of the A-zone corridor was cut off, leaving the operatives unable to see anything. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Lewis quickly adjusted the battle plan. "Snipers!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Lewis' urgent voice, the operatives quickly activated the shooting command. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Activate the detonation program!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, James continued to throw bombs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time James and the S members broke in, the operatives in Zone A had already entered the escape route. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost as soon as the door closed, James shot through the program console of the escape route with his gun. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a few deafening gunshots, the console was destroyed, and the escape door came </span><span>to a sudden stop. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, the escape route was already open, so whether the door was closed or not, the operatives and the black-clad individuals still had a way out. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, everyone in Zone A turned and ran along the escape route.</span></p></div>
