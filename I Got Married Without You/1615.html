        <h1>Chapter 1615 Meaningless</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She finally mustered the courage not to go in and just stayed downstairs in the living room. She didn't do much, just kept Erin company, sitting on the couch, watching TV. When it was time for dinner, she got up and went to the kitchen to make a blueberry pie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While making the blueberry pie, Erin stood by, arms crossed, silently watching her busy about. Only when she finished and brought the dish to the table did he sit down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Stella would pick up a piece of blueberry pie and put it in Erin's bowl. "Try it and see if it tastes good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erin raised his eyebrows slightly and then parted his lips, motioning to Stella, "Feed me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a resigned smile, Stella picked up the blueberry pie again and put it in his mouth, watching him slowly eat it. Her resigned smile would then turn into a doting </span><span>one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if the piece of blueberry pie had fallen from a height and smashed on the ground, she still wouldn't have noticed and would continue to feed Erin the pie, as if it could make up for something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At night, Stella would hold Erin's hand and go to the garden outside the villa. It was actually overgrown with weeds, but in Stella's eyes, it was a garden...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would take a walk with Erin, from the garden to the beach, then lie on the lawn, look at the night sky, look at the stars, and talk to Erin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Late at night, Stella would return to the master bedroom, take a clean bath, hug Erin's waist, snuggle into his embrace, close her eyes and sleep. Even though it was just a body pillow, she could feel the strength of Erin's presence, comforting and reassuring...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's how she spent 29 days with Erin...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the last day, Stella pushed open the door of the birdcage room...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Strangely, she didn't see Erin sitting by the French window. There was nothing there, only the remnants of bloodstains...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because no one cared about Erin, he was dead. After they moved the body, no one would come to clean up the bloodstains. This place was like an abandoned wasteland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The smell of blood was heavy inside, with a hint of decay. This scent tempted Stella towards death. It seemed that only in death could she find release...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella gripped the gun and walked step by step to the French window, then slowly sat down, in the same position and posture as Erin...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She killed him to repay her own life, so she should die in the same way he did. No one could escape the condemnation of their conscience...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she pulled the trigger, she sent a message to the local police, admitting that Erin did not commit suicide out of fear, but that she shot him dead. It was a belated confession...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sending it, she raised the gun in her hand, without any hesitation, aimed it at her own heart, and pulled the trigger fiercely &ndash;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Amelia's video call started on time, just like the last 29 days. If she didn't answer, that foolish woman wouldn't stop calling...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood poured out from Stella's </span><span>heart,</span><span> she could clearly feel it. The bullet pierced through her heart, leaving a dent on the window behind her. Whether it broke through the window, Stella didn't know...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lowered her dark eyes, staring at the sweet profile picture of Amelia on her phone, tears streaming down her face...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, I'm sorry, I've let you down &ndash;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>You wanted me to live, but I can't go on living.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My entire life so far has been a mistake. My existence since childhood has been a mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella wondered, what meaning did her own life have? It seemed meaningless, so if it was meaningless, why lived on?</span></p></div>
