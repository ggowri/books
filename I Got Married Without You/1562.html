        <h1>Chapter 1562 let's put an end to this</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella wanted to make Erin suffer, but she didn't expect this revenge to backfire. Now she was facing the consequences of her own actions, but it had nothing to do with Henry. Why did Erin have to be so harsh on Henry? The image of Henry being knocked unconscious pained Stella's heart. "Erin, this is between you and me, don't involve Henry, let him go." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erin was capable of anything. If he really brought Henry here, he might actually violate her in front of Henry. In that case, it's better for her to be trapped here, forever in darkness. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man gripping her waist ignored her and coldly asked in her ear, "Is it more pleasurable to make love to me or to him?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella knew that if she confronts Erin head-on, she would only invite more crazy retaliation. So, she lowered her gaze and gritted her teeth, "Henry has never touched me." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the truth. The only man who had touched Stella was Erin, but he didn't believe her. He thought Stella was lying to protect Henry, "You've been dating him for so long and haven't slept together. Do you think I'm a fool?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella didn't bother to indulge him, "Believe it or not." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, she closed her eyes again and ignored him. This made Erin so angry that he flipped her over and made her kneel on the ground, increasing the force from behind. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a humiliating position, Stella knelt on the ground, holding onto the railing of the birdcage and biting her teeth, enduring the pain he inflicted on her... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She despised herself for being like this, wishing she could go back to ten years ago and wake up the version of herself plotting revenge against Erin with a slap. If she hadn't provoked him and didn't resent him, maybe she could still live with dignity abroad, but... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She also knew very well that if she didn't provoke him and didn't resent him, her past self wouldn't have survived. She was able to hold on until now because of her hatred for him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she had no hatred, she probably would have died in the wilderness a long time ago. How could she be the person she is today? She just didn't understand why she had to be entangled with him instead of simply killing him directly... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erin vented all his anger on Stella, tormenting her until she passed out before finally letting her go. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaning against the birdcage railing, Erin lowered his gaze and stared at Stella, who was lying obediently on his lap with her eyes closed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his slender fingers and brushed away the sweaty strands of hair on Stella's face, revealing a familiar and delicate face. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at her brows and eyes for a long time, then lifted his fingertips and traced her features over and over again, as if wanting to etch them into his bones, with deep affection and longing, gently caressing... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's unknown how much time passed, but when the night fell and moonlight shone through the scattered tree shadows on the island, Erin finally released the handcuffs </span><span>that bound Stella's hands and feet, and carried her, still unconscious, back to bed... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held Stella tightly from behind, as if holding the whole world, and kept her tightly in his embrace. "What should I do with you..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the quiet bedroom, where even the sound of a falling needle could be heard, there suddenly came a sigh of helplessness and powerlessness... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, Stella woke up and saw herself naked, but wearing new clothes. The clothes fit her perfectly, tailored to her size. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, even though she was wearing new clothes, she was still locked in the birdcage. It was strange because after being restrained all night, her hands and feet should be red and painful, but she didn't feel any pain, not even a hint of redness. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Stella was puzzled, Erin walked in from outside the door. Towering over her, he looked at her like a trapped animal. "Stella, let's put an end to this..."</span></p></div>
