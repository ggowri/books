        <h1>Chapter 1825 The game of two</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia frowned, unable to understand, which made Matty tilt his head slightly. "Do you know something?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In order not to arouse Matty's suspicion, Amelia shook her head gently. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's better not to speak out of turn before having solid evidence. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most important thing at the moment was how to contact James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had to tell him everything she knew to prevent him from staying undercover in Erebus. "Can you release James?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty interlaced his fingers on the table and moved them slightly. "Amelia, I haven't restricted James' freedom." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you haven't restricted his freedom, why hasn't he come home or even called?" Previously, Amelia couldn't understand why James hadn't contacted her within 23 days if Erebus didn't restrict the operatives' freedom. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that her thoughts were clearer, she began to suspect that Matty was restricting James' personal freedom, otherwise James wouldn't have failed to contact her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why would Matty restrict James' freedom? Could it be that he already knew James' identity, or was it just a test?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty seemed to sense Amelia's thoughts and stared at her with a puzzled expression. "I've always found it strange that a man like James, who can have anything he wants, would repeatedly play life and death games in Erebus." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This statement changed Amelia's expression. She didn't know if Matty was testing her or playing a psychological game with her, knowing James' identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After weighing her options, she calmly spoke. "He's just a bit of a gambler." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In that case, why are you still looking for him?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was unsure if Matty knew James' identity and was hesitant to act rashly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty took advantage of this and skillfully manipulated Amelia, inducing her. "I've </span><span>seen the surveillance footage of James forcing you to divorce. It wasn't intentional on his part, Emily forced him to do it." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I think James could have handled it in a better way to make you leave, but he chose the cruelest way, coldly pushing you away." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From this, you can see that James doesn't love you that much, so don't have any expectations of him, it's not worth it." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia felt uncomfortable hearing Matty's words, as she had previously thought the same way, but now she felt that this matter could be put on hold until she saw James in person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've said so much, but you still won't release James, which shows that you have something to hide." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty took a deep breath and then nonchalantly raised his chin. "If you insist on seeing him, I'll go to Erebus tomorrow and make him put aside his current tasks to come out and see you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Matty spoke, he seemed unfazed, as if he hadn't restricted James' personal freedom, but rather that James himself didn't want to come out. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia couldn't quite figure out Matty's methods, but she didn't easily believe him, so she suggested a compromise. "Can't I call him and ask him to come to Canada to see me?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty hadn't expected Amelia to be so clever and sat up straight. "He's currently on a mission with 1-4, so he can't be contacted at this time."</span></p></div>
