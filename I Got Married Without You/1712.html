        <h1>Chapter 1712 A month</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't know the responsibility James was carrying, she only worried about him. "You used to finish missions in just one or two days, but this time it will take a whole month. It must be very dangerous, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James calmly reassured her, "There may be some danger, but you have to trust me, I will make sure nothing happens to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't believe it. "Then take me with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James sighed and ran his hand through Amelia's hair. "Amelia, there are only men around me, it's not appropriate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia knew that James would never take her, she just wanted to be rebellious for once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she also knew very well that she couldn't cause trouble for him just because of her own stubbornness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt weak, clutching onto his shirt and pressing her cheek against his chest. "I'm so useless," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help him, she could only stay at home, feeling completely useless!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James smirked, his eyes filled with adoration. "With you here, my life has meaning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without her, his life would be dull and meaningless. How could she not be important?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he was the one who was about to do something dangerous, he still had to comfort Amelia. She felt touched by James' unconditional love for her. "Honey, it's only for a month. If you don't come back, I'll come find you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were a couple, and no matter what happened, they would always be together. However, James didn't allow it. "If I don't come back in a month, I will definitely have someone come and let you know I'm safe. You must not come looking for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, one month was just a tentative time frame and there was still a possibility that James might not come back. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's heart sank, "If you don't come back after one month, then I will marry someone else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James felt a tightness in his chest as a wave of pain washed over him. "Amelia, I know you're pressuring me to come back within a certain time frame. I promise I will come back, I will definitely come back. It's just that unexpected things can happen and it might delay me a bit. But that doesn't mean I won't come back. Can't you just wait for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia would never not wait for him, whether it's for a month or a year. But she wanted to tie him down, to make him remember that if he doesn't come back, he'll lose her. And then he would definitely come back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James understood what she was thinking, but he also thought it wouldn't be a bad thing if he really had an accident and she married someone else. At least she could live a good life and not follow him to do something foolish. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as soon as this thought came to mind, James' heart felt like it was being squeezed into a ball, and a suffocating feeling overwhelmed him, making it hard for him to breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was terrified when she saw James in such pain, his face turning pale and cold sweat pouring down. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She desperately held onto him and said, "Babe, I lied to you. Whether you come back in a month or not, I will never marry anyone else. I just wanted to force you to come back on time, I just wanted to force you to come back on time..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cried and repeated the last sentence over and over again, like a child who had made a big mistake and didn't know what to do, so she could only cry, crying non-stop...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia went from softly sobbing to uncontrollably crying, causing James to also well up with tears. He held Amelia tightly and said, "Don't cry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't cry, I&rsquo;m here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't cry, I will come back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia wasn't someone who couldn't handle goodbyes, but she still cried all night when James told her he would be leaving for a month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't just treat this month as her husband going on a business trip, because she knew how dangerous James' mission was. Even though he didn't say where he was going or what he was going to do, she could sense that this separation might change their current life trajectory, which made her very uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was no exception, but he couldn't help but think about the S members who had died one after another, and Emily's fierce gaze fixed on Amelia. He had to go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't know how to express these feelings, so he could only comfort Amelia over and over again, "Honey, don't worry, it's just a mission, there's nothing to be afraid of, don't cry..."</span></p></div>
