        <h1>Chapter 1979 James Is in a Coma</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last week, Grace announced at home that she would participate in a debate competition, taking the fourth debater position. Alexander mocked her, saying she wasn't capable, which infuriated Grace. She insisted on betting with him and surprisingly won the bet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced at the hand extended under his nose and sneered, "Your usual skill at talking back and arguing is quite impressive. Winning the championship is well-deserved. Congratulations."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace could only hear the mockery, not the congratulations. "Say what you want, but you lost this time. Hurry up and give the money to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander leisurely unfolded his napkin, laid it out, and said calmly, "After dinner, I'll give it to you. But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander raised an eyebrow and looked at the domineering Grace. "You're already seventeen, still in high school, and you haven't even secured a recommendation. I wonder if you can get into college during the entrance exams."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace's heart skipped a beat. "Don't think you're so great just because you got into the world's top school. Maybe next year, I'll get into your school!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander picked up his knife and fork, cut a piece of steak, and put it in his mouth. "Then you would become my junior."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace was so angry, she couldn't even retort. Before she could respond, Alexander smirked again. "When we meet at school next year, junior, remember to call me 'senior.'"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm so mad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace pounded her chest and stomped her feet, then angrily pulled out a chair and sat down. She grabbed Amelia's arm and leaned on her shoulder, whining.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Auntie, Alexander is so annoying! When will you send him away? I don't want to see him anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia reached out and patted Grace's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When Alexander leaves, you might miss him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace was stubborn, but her eyes drifted to Alexander's annoying face. To be honest, after ten years of bickering with him, she did have some feelings for him, but he was still very annoying!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wish he would leave soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia laughed, picked up a fork, and speared a piece of fruit, placing it in Grace's mouth. Grace opened her mouth to take it, glaring provocatively at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Auntie loves me the most."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander rolled his eyes at her and was about to retort when Amelia glared at him. He swallowed his harsh words, knowing that Amelia loved Grace the most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having gained the upper hand, Grace was very happy and ate with gusto. She constantly asked Amelia to feed her tuna and foie gras, keeping Amelia so busy she barely had time to eat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't want to intervene, but for some reason, he suddenly put down his knife and fork and looked at Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I want some foie gras too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia glanced at the little jealous boy and smiled. She cut a piece of foie gras and brought it to his lips. Alexander didn't take it but opened his mouth instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Feed me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander only showed this childish side when Grace was around. Usually, he was cold and distant, rarely showing jealousy or acting spoiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're going to college and still act like a spoiled child."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though she said that, Amelia still fed him the foie gras and then took a napkin to wipe his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her actions were full of motherly love, which Alexander felt warmly. He then provocatively smiled at Grace, "My mom still loves me the most."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace rolled her eyes dramatically, unconcerned. "Give the money to me. Otherwise, I'll pester you all night!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander snorted coldly and turned his head, ignoring Grace. She snorted back and buried herself in her food again. Amelia kept serving both kids, afraid they wouldn't eat enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching the three of them, James smiled. The warmth over the years had gradually filled his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to live like this with them, but the pain in his head reminded him again and again that he might not live to see Grace get married or Alexander grow up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lowered his gaze, and the knife and fork in his hand suddenly fell onto the plate, making a crisp sound that made the three of them look up at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes were filled with concern and worry, especially Amelia's, who was about to get up. James quickly controlled his headache and raised an eyebrow at Amelia. "I'm full."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He got up and left the dining room. Grace and Alexander thought he was really full and didn't mind. Only Amelia, watching his tall and straight back, felt her worry increase instead of decrease...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing the meal with the two kids, Amelia went back to the bedroom. When she opened the door, she saw James sitting on the sofa with his eyes closed, as if he were asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia walked over and gently called out to him. When he didn't respond, she reached out and shook his arm, but there was still no reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, she couldn't describe how she felt. Amelia only knew that her legs suddenly went weak, and with a thud, she kneeled on the ground. Her raised hand fell onto his leg, but she had no strength left to grab him.</span></p></div>
