        <h1>Chapter 1717 The agonizing wait</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following behind James, Holden suddenly stopped after a few steps and looked at Emelyn sitting in the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I don't come back, find someone else to marry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emelyn's heart skipped a beat as she stared blankly at Holden's retreating figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had a secret crush on him, but never spoke a word about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden had always been emotionally distant and clueless when it came to love. He had no idea about her feelings for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the words he just said seemed to reveal that he knew she was in love with him, silently and secretly, all this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emelyn's indifferent fox-like eyes gradually became sore and red...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bro, if you don't come back, I will never get married.'</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After James left, Amelia couldn't bring herself to do anything. Most of the time, she would sit on the sofa in the study, curled up and staring out the window in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neil had come to urge the Lawrence family's design plans several times. Whenever he saw her looking distracted, he would pull Grace over to cheer her up. Amelia would occasionally force a smile, but it didn't come from the heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hardest part was at night, Amelia was used to sleeping with James in her arms, but now that he was gone, she was afraid to even turn off the lights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the middle of the night, she would wake up and reach out to the spot next to her. When she felt the coldness, she couldn't help but feel sad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James went to complete his mission without his phone. She couldn't contact him or video call, so she just sat at home, drawing and waiting for him to come back...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the Evans Group, Paul announced internally, as instructed by James, that James would be heading to Europe to develop new territories. The trip was scheduled for one month, during which time Paul would act as interim CEO.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He managed to calm down the rest of the company, but he couldn't calm down the other members of the Evans Family. When they heard that James had left, they started arguing and demanding that Paul explain the distribution of shares.'</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul was almost blocked by a group of messy relatives at the entrance of the company or in the meeting room every day. At first, with the persuasion of his brothers, Paul could grit his teeth and endure it. But after it happened multiple times, he started to lose his temper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even the relatives who were still under the Evans' employment couldn't be intimidated by his temper. "Paul, you are just an interim CEO, not the one in charge. Since you can't give an explanation, then just sell your shares publicly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were afraid that James would come back for revenge, so they didn't dare to ask Amelia for shares. However, they weren't afraid of Paul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they underestimated Paul. Apart from his quick temper and impulsiveness, he was also quite ruthless. "Sebastian, the management of personnel in the company, is it your subordinates' responsibility?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sebastian nodded, 'I am in charge of the administrative department, so it's my subordinates who are responsible for it.'"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's eyes narrowed with malice, growing even more intense. "You fired everyone who opposed James' share allocation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people in the conference room were stunned, even Sebastian doubted if he had heard it wrong. He sat up straight and leaned forward, "Did you say all of it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were many relatives currently working at the Evans Family, and if they were all fired, it would have serious consequences. Grandpa might even come back to make things right for them...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's voice was cold and unquestionable as he said, "Make sure your people are taken care of this afternoon. I don't want to see them again tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Paul closed his laptop and got up to leave the conference room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they watched the figure of the shooting star, Sebastian and Christopher exchanged a glance. Paul had changed a bit during this time, seeming to have gained a sense of maturity and courage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was also good this way, they've long been fed up with those old-fashioned relatives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dealing with the company's affairs, Paul returned to his office and opened his calendar. He stared at the numbers counting down and his face was filled with worry. He didn't know how James was doing now and if he would be able to come back in a month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One month later, Amelia's painting was already finished and entrusted to Neil to deliver to the Lawrence family. However, James did not return within the specified time...</span></p></div>
