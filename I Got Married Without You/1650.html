        <h1>Chapter 1650 Leading her to empathize with Eva</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate gradually calmed down because of James' words. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised her puzzled eyes and asked James, "Are you saying that Paul changed and grew because he fell in love with Eva?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James responded casually, "Kate, Paul fell down many times with Ms. Miller before he realized he loved her and made changes for her. Otherwise, he would still be irresponsible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Actually, Kate noticed that even when Paul came home angry, he still managed to finish his work at home. This was something he would never have done before. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then she thought, she had educated her son many times to work hard and not play around, but he never listened to her. As soon as Eva came into the picture, he immediately changed. It made Kate feel uncomfortable deep down, but she remained silent because James always sided with Eva.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, seeing Kate's resistance, had a cold and intense look in his eyes, and his words became even more profound. "Kate, you once assumed Anthony was a playboy based on one-sided information and broke him apart from Edith. Then, when you saw Anthony's growth, you wanted to matchmake him with Edith again. But what was the result? Edith no longer loved Anthony and rejected other men as well. Even someone like Dylan couldn't catch her attention. As a result, she hasn't married anyone until now because of your interference. Do you want to ruin your son's life now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whenever Edith and Anthony were mentioned, it brought up guilt in Kate's heart, and she couldn't argue with James' strong words. She could only respond softly, "I am sorry for breaking up Edith and Anthony. But Eva is different from Anthony. She doesn't love Paul with the same dedication as Anthony loved Edith. She wouldn't beg me to help her like Anthony did. All she does is cause trouble for my son. As a mother, it's normal for me to intervene."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her implication was that the situations between Anthony and Edith, and Eva and Paul were different. She also felt that James' words were too harsh. After all, she had only reached out to Eva once. How could that ruin Paul's entire life?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In reality, Kate was just using Eva's lack of love for Paul as an excuse to satisfy her controlling desire to choose her future daughter-in-law.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James understood this but didn't point it out. He simply said coldly, "If even a mother thinks Paul won't wholeheartedly commit, how could Ms. Miller, who has experienced a failed marriage, dare to love your son wholeheartedly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate's heart sank. It seemed like James was leading her to empathize with Eva. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she started questioning herself. If she were in Eva's position, would she dare to take a chance on a man with Paul's character? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The answer was no. She didn't want to risk her smooth-sailing life on an unfaithful man, but Eva did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva said that if she married Paul, she wouldn't treat him the same as before. She would give everything, love him wholeheartedly, cherish him, protect him, and never betray him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could a woman who made such a commitment not love her son?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate's eyebrows furrowed, but she also realized that she was thinking from Eva's perspective, which made her find </span><span>James</span><span> terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Truly, James being the head of the Evans Family, not only left her speechless with his negotiation, but also made her accept the fact that Paul loved Eva more. He even made her see things from Eva's perspective with just a few words...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following the logic, James made Kate realize that Edith was a cautionary tale. If she didn't learn from it and understand her children, and instead continued to pressure her son, she should consider what she would do if her son, after losing his loved one, wasn't as strong as her daughter and couldn't move on. Would she cry over his dead body or regret her actions?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate, startled by the mention of a "dead body," paled and said, "A person with Paul's character... he wouldn't do that, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James raised an eyebrow, "How do you know he wouldn't?"</span></p></div>
