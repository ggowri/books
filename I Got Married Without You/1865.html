        <h1>Chapter 1865 Gather at the Cloud Territory</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James looked </span><span>up,</span><span> his voice cold: "I didn't inform you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing in the darkness, Holden spoke calmly: "Zack and the other members were also my friends. It is my duty to avenge them." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's cold gaze passed over Holden and looked at the closed door that Andrew had already shut: "You might as well go back with him and listen to his truth." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A contemptuous smile curled up at the corner of Holden's lips: "The so-called truth is nothing more than sharpening two sharp knives." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both of them were knives honed by Master Davies, but James's blade was aimed at his own family, while Holden's blade was used to expand Master Davies's power. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Holden felt a pang of bitterness: "Zack and the other members were just tools for Master Davies's revenge, and yet we were loyal to him." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling resentful that his friends had been deceived, Holden said with determination, </span><span>"After this is over, I will become an enemy of Master Davies. You don't have to worry about it." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James glanced at him and said, "What you need to do is to disband the S organization after this is over and let Matty deal with Master Davies, not take matters into your own hands." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James exuded a coldness that Holden did not possess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought that you would feel sad after knowing the truth, but it seems that you remain as calm as ever." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smile appeared in James's eyes. If Holden had experienced what he had experienced, then Holden would understand why he had to remain calm. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his life, James did not seek the affection of his family or the pity and sympathy of others. The only thing he desired was Amelia, apart from her, James had no other desires. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden took a step forward and stood in front of James, who was bathed in sunlight. "In the past, I used to resent that Master Davies valued you more than me, but from now on, I, Holden, will follow you wholeheartedly." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James raised an eyebrow, assessing Holden's sincere expression. "After avenging Zack and the members, I won't have anything to do with the S organization anymore. You don't have to follow me. Do you have to go?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden nodded. "I have already gathered the members from headquarters. However, I cannot mobilize the people under Master Davies, but we have enough strength to assist you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was decisive. He gave a cold order, "Tell your people to be ready at the Cloud territory airport tomorrow morning at 10:25." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>10:25 was the time when James's private plane would arrive. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the moment he arrived, their only task would be to seek revenge. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Cloud territory, a tall man dressed in black uniform, accompanied by a group of people, walked briskly out of the airport. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the airport, Holden, who was waiting, quickly signaled the people below to open the car doors. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James stepped forward with his long legs and sat in the car, looking at Holden. "Let's go." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden responded and raised his hand. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members wearing masks quickly got into the car. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the car doors closed, numerous black cars sped into the country at a rapid pace. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter, who was waiting inside the country, stood by helicopters with his members, ready for action. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the black cars arrived at the meeting point in an orderly manner, crossing rugged mountain roads. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first car door opened, and James got out of the car, followed closely by Holden and Emelyn. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emelyn, who already knew everything, had questioned Master Davies that night and was disappointed with the answers she received. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that her brother had betrayed James, so she chose to stand on her brother's side without hesitation. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Emelyn's support, even without the members under Master Davies, James was more than capable of dealing with Erebus. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter greeted James as he got out of the car, handing him a pair of white gloves and respectfully saying, "Sir, explosives have been arranged on each helicopter, and the blast radius has been calculated by professionals." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James accepted the gloves and nodded lightly. "Ensure that everything goes according to plan." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can count on us."</span></p></div>
