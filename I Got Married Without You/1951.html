        <h1>Chapter 1951 James fixed Alexander</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The notorious behavior of the three siblings in the Evans family quickly reached the ears of the principal at the kindergarten.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The principal took the lead and had a conversation with Alexander, asking him where he learned such mischievous tricks.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Alexander said he learned them from Uncle Johnny.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The principal then called Amelia to ask why Johnny was teaching the children such improper things.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coincidentally, Johnny was visiting the blue bay island that day to see Alexander. He overheard the principal accusing him of teaching the children improper things and became furious. He snatched Amelia's phone and argued with the principal for a long time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until the principal mentioned that Alexander was now the leader of the kindergarten and had to take care of the other children, including those from the neighboring kindergarten, that Johnny finally shut his mouth. The reason for his silence was indeed related to him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Gigi got married, Johnny returned to his home country and stayed in a villa across from the blue bay island.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would occasionally provoke James and, when James was not around, he would take Alexander around to show off his power. But he never taught him how to fight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regardless of whether Johnny taught him or not, Amelia prohibited him from getting close to Alexander and revoked his permission to visit the children in the future.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This forced Johnny to only pick up Alexander from the kindergarten, mainly to let Alexander explain to Amelia that he never taught him how to fight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing by the roadside, Alexander raised his chin and stared at Johnny for a while before saying, "Uncle, I'm sorry. I don't want to go to kindergarten and get beaten up. I can only say it's because of what you taught me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny watched as Alexander walked away with his small backpack, getting angrier by the second.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander sat in the car, he lowered the window, pulled up the corners of his mouth, and waved at Johnny, saying, "Goodbye, Uncle..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>News of Alexander bullying others spread among the Evans family, the Clark family, and the Lawrence family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone thought this child was a bit naughty and took turns trying to teach him a lesson, only to be driven away one by one.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Dylan, whom Alexander quite liked, could make him obedient. Whenever Dylan said something, he wouldn't dare to say otherwise.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia even allowed Dylan to stay at their home for a while to help teach Alexander. Dylan agreed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, Alexander became well-behaved and stopped causing trouble at the kindergarten. He followed Dylan around all day like a little shadow.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when everyone thought Dylan could control Alexander, the boy took advantage of Dylan's inattention and sneaked into his room, taking Dylan's gun.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Dylan discovered it, Alexander was hiding behind the garden, holding the gun in his small hand, aiming at the lychee roses in the garden, imitating the manner of a big shot in the movies and firing accurately.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing a rose head being shot off, Dylan was stunned, and Amelia, who followed closely behind, was even more terrified.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Alexander, fearless, stood up straight and asked Dylan, "Uncle, am I a good shot?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan finally realized that this little guy was interested in his gun, which was why he had been following him around.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan thought he could lead Alexander onto the right path, but it turned out...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan told James about it, and the men in the company couldn't believe that such a young child was playing with guns.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They even canceled an international meeting and James grabbed a stick and returned to the blue bay island.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike Dylan, Johnny, and Herb, who indulged the child, James didn't hesitate to grab Alexander's arm and pin him to the table, pulling down his pants.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When James saw the small and tender buttocks of the child, he dropped the stick and used his hand to spank him. Alexander cried out for his mother in pain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing her child crying and seeking help, Amelia didn't intervene. The child was in the wrong, and it was only right for the father to discipline him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a mother, no matter how much it hurt, she couldn't be soft-hearted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that his mother didn't come to his aid, Alexander seemed to realize his mistake.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slowly retracted his outstretched hand and stopped crying, allowing James to discipline him. However, his teary eyes still held a sense of defiance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he was defiant, James' discipline this time helped Alexander get rid of many bad habits, such as bullying, playing with knives and guns, and disrespecting teachers and others.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of these behaviors disappeared from him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although his bad habits were gone, he became strange. He would always sit in the study reading books and didn't like to talk anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Except for Amelia, he disregarded everyone else, even James. This situation continued for two years...</span></p></div>
