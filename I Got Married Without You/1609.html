        <h1>Chapter 1609 Erin's grave</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas saw the escalating public opinion and decided to remove himself from the situation, placing all the blame on Karen...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen quickly became the target of public anger, and the Simpson family took advantage of the situation to pressure Thomas into kicking Karen out of the house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas still had some lingering feelings for Karen and didn't kick her out until the police arrived and arrested Karen for killing her own cousin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Karen was being taken away, she fell to her knees in front of Thomas, grabbing onto his pants and crying, "Husband, save me! I didn't kill anyone! Please make them let me go..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After recovering from his shock, Thomas looked down at the woman crying in front of him, her face contorted in pain. He could hardly believe that beneath her gentle </span><span>exterior was such a wicked and venomous snake. And all of this was for the inheritance that she could have easily obtained. She killed her own cousin and caused Erin's death...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if Thomas was only just seeing Karen for the first time. He didn't say a word, simply bent down, forcefully removing her grip from his pants, and let the police take her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen, seeing that Thomas wouldn't save her, began to curse him. She cursed him for not being able to protect even his own wife, for his ex-wife's suicide, for the death of their son. Her words were as harsh as they could be, even insulting Thomas's parents...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Karen started implicating others, saying, "Don't just arrest me, arrest Stella too! She's the one who killed Erin, why are you only arresting me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The police couldn't be bothered with her and forcefully pushed her into the car, closing the door. The police car sped away from the Simpson family's front gate, and from then on, Karen's scandal would spread to every corner of Imperial Capital, becoming a topic of gossip for people's idle chats...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But whenever people mentioned the Simpson family, they would inevitably bring up their eldest son. The jokes would turn into sighs as they remembered Erin, who had such incredible skills in healing and saving lives. It was a pity that he died like this...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, no one would insult Erin for being unfilial. His reputation was cleared, but he could never return...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Karen was sent to jail, Stella came to Erin's grave...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She leaned against the tombstone, slowly squatting down. When she saw that the tombstone was empty, without even a picture, Stella's heart ached...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every other tombstone around had pictures embedded in them, but not Erin's. The grand funeral turned out to be so cruel and desolate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gently touched Erin's name on the tombstone, apologizing in her heart. And...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She held onto the poorly made tombstone and said in a hoarse voice, "I rejected Henry. I won't marry him anymore, don't worry..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thing he feared the most when he was alive was her marrying Henry. He didn't get his wish when he was alive, and now he had it, even though it didn't mean anything anymore...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella opened her lips, wanting to say something, but she didn't know how to start. Did she still love him? If she didn't, why was she so sad? Did she forgive him? But he had been violent towards her. Did she not forgive him? But Erin loved her to the last seconds of his life. Stella's heart was torn apart, and she didn't even know how much she was suffering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All she knew was that she couldn't sleep day or night and needed medication to forget the image of shooting and killing Erin, watching him bleed to death, and sitting there waiting for death...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suffered, but she also believed that she could get through it. After all, there was always more hatred than love between them. But...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella lowered her gaze, thinking about how Erin had protected her until the end. She felt a pain, like a virus invading her body, making her wish for death...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clutched her chest, feeling extremely uncomfortable, when Mike walked slowly behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cousin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this voice, Stella quickly wiped away the tears in her eyes, straightened her back, and turned to face Mike, who had already walked up to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella didn't speak to him, she just looked at him. He had his hands in the pockets of his white suit pants, and he turned his head to look at Erin's grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cousin, you came to the wrong place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella's heart skipped a beat at his words, and her eyebrows furrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was Erin also taken away and saved, like Amelia? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as this thought crossed her mind, Stella's heart, which had been still as water, began to beat again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Mike curved his lips and smirked, cutting off her wild thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His ashes were scattered into the sea by Karen a long time ago. What lies here is just a pile of sand..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who would care about Erin? Who would open the urn and see if it really contained his ashes?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Where did Erin's ashes blow? In a foreign land? Or in some nameless deserted sea? Or in a place where there was no trace of human presence...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen wanted Erin to become a ghost, a lonely and companionless spirit...</span></p></div>
