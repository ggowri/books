        <h1>Chapter 1772 Venom's identity</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James woke up in pain, the pain in his heart jolting him awake from his sleep. He lifted his hand to clutch at his spasming chest, subconsciously thinking of Amelia, which only made the pain in his heart worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't say anything, just took it upon himself to push her away. He didn't know if it was right or wrong, but he felt very uneasy, like he was about to lose something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The excruciating pain made his face go pale, and as his fingers slowly moved to his shoulder, he felt the pain start to ease when he touched the teeth marks above his collarbone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She left a mark on him, bringing a moment of peace to his otherwise dark and lonely existence. Thankfully, he had her mark to keep him company, so he wouldn't be so alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But everything in front of him was pitch black, he couldn't see anything clearly. The wall next to him kept making a rhythmic thudding sound, one after the other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James sat up straight, listening intently. In the chaotic Morse code, he deciphered the words "I am Venom." He immediately raised his finger and tapped on the wall lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After exchanging a secret code with Venom in the adjacent cell, James tapped on the wall again: "The eighth round of the game, </span><span>Johnny</span><span> is dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Venom's hand on the wall suddenly stiffened for a moment, then returned to normal: "Understood."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's cold and fierce eyes revealed a hint of malice. Controlled by the chip, he found it difficult to kill Emily and Mr. Ben, but he could use someone else to do it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, James extended his chilling finger and tapped on the wall without any emotion: "He is your sister's child, won't you help him get revenge?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson, without a mask, had a handsome face that showed no signs of aging, with a refined and elegant appearance. Leaning against the wall, he casually tapped: "I said I would get him out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had arranged for people in the upper area to modify the program directly after </span><span>Johnny</span><span>'s game failed, knowing the rules of Erebus, Venom would not only arrange for Scar to do it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson knew what James wanted him to do, so he didn't hide it and continued tapping: "2-7 reported me and caused trouble for my nephew. After I get out, I will take care of them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The eighth round of the game was shooting. Although the people in the upper area would modify the program and the bullets would miss, </span><span>Johnny</span><span> would still be hit. Moreover, he had long been displeased with those two people who had come to Erebus flaunting the list of S members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson thought of what Emily and Mr. Ben had said in the hallway when James was brought in, and subconsciously asked: "I heard that you not only manipulated in secret but also cracked the 1-1 authority?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, without much emotion, replied: "Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson continued to ask: "Are you trying to stop Amelia from participating in games in other areas?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James did not reply, but his silence was the answer, which made Carson frown slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Carson was locked up, he had already guessed the situation. Even though he had taken double precautions, James would not let Amelia be harmed in any way, which was why he challenged the authority of 1-1, but...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson's deep, dark eyes revealed a hint of concern: "Although 1-1 doesn't come to Erebus often, if he finds out about this, he will definitely come after you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's face, shrouded in mist, suddenly took on a murderous intent: "I'll be waiting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson didn't know James's true identity, but he knew that after seeing him once, 1-1 was impressed by his skills and abilities and said he wanted to recruit James into Erebus. However, when 1-2 planned to go find James, he took the initiative and rewrote the program for the seventh round of the game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to test James's reaction, but during the seventh round, a guy named Zack pushed James aside and took the punishment for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people around him were loyal to him, but they couldn't see his reaction, so 1-2 redesigned the program for the ninth round.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, James saw through his manipulation and made a choice using reverse thinking, just as 1-2 had anticipated. But it seemed like he didn't want to win the prize money, but wanted to meet the mysterious figure in black. However, this was only speculation by a few of the founders behind the scenes.</span></p></div>
