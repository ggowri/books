        <h1>Chapter 1796 A paternity test</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing Dylan, Amelia was momentarily taken aback. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed she didn't understand how he knew her and why he had come to find her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had he somehow discovered her impersonation of Skender during their project discussion at his home? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just told you that she's not feeling well and doesn't have the energy to take on any projects. Why are you here?" Johnny, displeased, glanced at Dylan. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unperturbed by Johnny's arrogance, Dylan simply smiled at Amelia. "Amelia, are you available?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia collected her thoughts and nodded at him. "I'm available." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan's gaze then shifted to the others. "I'd like to have a private chat with you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Johnny was about to refuse him, Amelia spoke up. "Paul, could you take Eva to the lounge to rest for a bit?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul found Dylan quite peculiar. Amelia had never met Dylan before, so why was he </span><span>seeking her out alone? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his confusion, Paul was obedient and helped Eva up, supporting her arm and waist. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they turned to leave, he glanced at Johnny. "Aren't you leaving?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This jerk was also quite strange. During Amelia's unconscious period, he had been by her bedside every day, never leaving her side. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If one didn't know better, they would think he was Amelia's husband. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul gave Johnny a suspicious look, making him feeling uncomfortable, he quickly got up and left. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they were gone, Dylan gracefully approached Amelia and sat where Eva had been sitting. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, I apologize for intruding while you're unwell." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan was quite refined, and his handsome face always bore a faint smile, giving the impression of a well-bred gentleman. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay." Amelia's impression of him was still favorable, so she remained gentle. "They've gone out, so what is it that you want to discuss?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan didn't bother with pleasantries and got straight to the point. "Amelia, when you pretended to be the designer Skender and came to discuss the project at my home, my grandfather noticed. He had someone look into it and found out it was you pretending to be Skender." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she had already guessed his intentions, Amelia's heart still skipped a beat upon hearing his words. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, is your grandfather sending you to ask me for compensation for breaching the contract?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't ask how Dylan's grandfather had noticed or how they had found out. After all, the Lawrence family's background and power were on par with the Evans </span><span>family's</span><span>. "No, I've come to discuss something else with you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The project contract stipulated that if the designer was not Skender himself, substantial compensation was required. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought Dylan had come to discuss the breach of contract, but it turned out not to be the case, leaving her puzzled. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it's not about the project, then what is it about?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no connection between her and Dylan, so she wondered why he had come to find her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaning back in his chair, Dylan casually hooked the corner of his mouth into a faint smile. "My grandfather had a first love named Sophia. I don't know if he ever mentioned her to you?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He did. What</span><span>&rsquo;s wrong with that</span><span>?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with Amelia's confusion, Dylan smiled again. "It's quite a coincidence. You look a lot like Sophia." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's face froze. "I look like your grandmother?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan nodded gently. "Yes, not just you, but your mother, </span><span>Sumasa</span><span>, also looks a lot like my grandmother." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Matty mentioned </span><span>Sumasa</span><span>, Amelia knew that they had looked into her, but she </span><span>hadn't expected that Matty had done so because </span><span>Sumasa</span><span> looked like his grandfather's first love. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, my grandfather suspects that you might be related to the Lawrence family, so he sent me to ask for a hair sample for a paternity test. Are you okay with that?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Dylan's words, Amelia began to suspect her own origins. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. It's just a test. After the results are out, regardless of whether you're related to the Lawrence family or not, we'll respect your decision." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was taken aback by the news and felt a bit hesitant, but Dylan didn't rush her and patiently explained the situation. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After some thought, she raised her hand and plucked a long strand of hair, handing it to Dylan. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether or not she was related, the test would help her mother find her family. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you." Dylan took the hair and then looked at Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt that Amelia was a very kind and elegant person, which </span><span>was</span><span> why she was gentle with everyone. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This reminded him of his brother, who was also kind-hearted and had an innate closeness. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan liked Amelia more and more, not in a romantic way, but in the way an older brother would feel about his younger sister. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought that if Amelia truly was his sister, he would be very happy. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After receiving the hair, Dylan bid farewell. "Amelia, I'll conduct the test and come back to you with the results." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan inexplicably revealed a fond smile. "Take care of yourself. If the doctor isn't good, let me know, and I'll arrange for the best doctors." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia </span><span>gently</span><span> smiled back.</span></p></div>
