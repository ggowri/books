        <h1>Chapter 1727 Gigi slapped Amelia</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're on a mission to find the mastermind behind it all. Only by uncovering their identity can we destroy Erebus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only way for the members of S to be permanently safe was to destroy Erebus, because Erebus's goal was to massacre every member of S, including James. Therefore, they couldn&rsquo;t stay out of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, did you guys find it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden shook his head, his eyes filled with endless self-blame. If he hadn't made the wrong choice, maybe they still had a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I had thought about staying there and taking on more challenges until I found the person behind it all, but after James let me go, I decided to leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that James wanted him to come back, to bring a message to Amelia and help her live on with faith. So, between sacrificing himself and delivering the message, Holden chose to deliver the message. It may seem weak, but it was James' last wish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He wanted me to keep you hidden all this time, but I couldn't do it. I'm sorry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia nodded in understanding and slowly clenched the fingers resting on her lap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her inner sadness was taken over by anger, she didn't know when it happened, but she could feel the hatred spreading from her chest to her face, causing her once gentle face to be covered in a layer of frost...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden hadn't left yet, and Gigi, who had regained consciousness from her coma, forced herself to get up and returned to Blue Bay Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without saying a word, she burst in and slapped Amelia hard. Her strength was immense, and the slap sent Amelia flying to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was your husband who killed Zack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia covered her burning face and raised her red eyes, tears blurring her vision, as she </span><span>looked at Gigi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Amelia saw tears streaming down her face and trembling all over, she slowly lowered her head... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Zack didn't die because of her, he died because of James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one would be generous enough to forgive someone who killed their loved one, even as a bystander. The fear of death would cause them to lose all rationality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't blame Gigi at all, she just felt sorry for her. After all, Zack's death was so tragic, and he didn't even know he was going to be a father before he died...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know, Zack said that after he finishes the last task with James, he will come back and marry me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi couldn't help but cry as she looked at Amelia lying on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He said he wanted to marry me, but because of your husband, he can never come back, never ever!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia let out a heart-wrenching scream, causing her to slightly turn her head and bury her face in her arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James had promised to come back, but he never did. Maybe he'll never come back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was lying on the ground, curled up in a ball, looking even more pitiful than Gigi's hysterical state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden wanted to go forward and help her up, but Johnny beat him to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Johnny grabbed Amelia's arm and helped her up, then turned to Gigi."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Her husband didn't come back either."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know very well that her husband hasn't come back either, I just..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi reached for her stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zack still doesn't know that I'm pregnant with his child, and I feel regretful about it. I don't know what to do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at Amelia's flushed cheeks, her eyes filled with pain and helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both of them lost their loved ones, but she could take out her anger on Amelia, while Amelia couldn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could only endure and bear it, because her husband was the one who caused the death of someone else's fianc&eacute;.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe sensing that hitting Amelia was wrong, Gigi quickly said sorry and ran out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny let go of Amelia's arm and after giving her a deep look, he also quickened his pace to catch up with her.</span></p></div>
