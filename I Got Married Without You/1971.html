        <h1>Chapter 1971 Fooling Kids</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Amelia's complaints, she put down her coffee cup and frowned, asking, "James seems pretty smart with a good IQ. Why not let him take the lead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia lowered her head, embarrassed. "He said he'd be back after the meeting. But all these years, he's never put the kids first. I doubt he'll care much..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva noticed the hickey under Amelia's collar and didn't need to ask where James' attention was. "I admire him, really. How does he have so much energy every day?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having spent a lot of time with Paul, Eva had become bolder in her speech, which made Amelia even more embarrassed. "It's not just me he's focused on. He's somewhat involved in the corporate affairs as well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva glanced at her slyly. "Except for a few decisions that his brothers can't make and the major corporate financial meetings that require his presence at the office, he's mostly at home with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, her face half-concealed behind her hand, said timidly, "My dear Eva, are you here to help me think of solutions or make fun of me? Can't we change the subject..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva smirked, "I really can't help you there. I'm not smarter than you. The best I can manage is to handle someone like Ken and Barbie, but as for your son, I'm really out of ideas."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva had secured her role as a beloved aunt in Alexander's heart because he had been fed with her breast milk at birth, which created a natural bond. Otherwise, with Alexander's personality, he wouldn't give her a second glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing her limitations, Eva preferred to maintain her comfortable position. She wisely declined the offer, saying,&nbsp; "But don't worry too much, with James around, Alexander won't stray off the path..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, due to the chip implanted in his brain and the uncertainty of his lifespan, had focused his attention solely on Amelia, leaving Alexander's upbringing largely unattended. However, with Alexander now facing a critical juncture, James would not remain absent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia sighed, propping her chin on her hand, "His idea of parenting is to hire a few tutors, drill Alexander with studies, and then leave him to his own devices. He barely communicates with Alexander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva laughed upon hearing this. "It's not that he doesn't communicate with Alexander. He's just not good at communicating with anyone. You're asking two people who don't like to talk to communicate. Isn't that just making it harder for them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Eva patted Amelia's hand reassuringly. "Don't worry, even the coldest and most silent people find their way to communicate. When the right time comes, it'll all work out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Comforted by Eva's words, Amelia let go of her worries and looked at the two children rolling around on the grass, chasing bubbles. "Forget it, let's just play with Ken and Barbie for a while..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether it was Margot and Maxwell's joyful laughter that drew Alexander in or something else entirely, he put down the model he was holding and walked over to the window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing Amelia twirling Maxwell around in the air, Alexander clenched his tiny fists and then lowered his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxwell, exhausted from a day of outdoor adventures, his face smeared with mud. He was led by the maid towards the house for a bath. As they entered through the back garden, they came upon Alexander leaning against the wall, arms crossed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxwell's frame stiffened as he caught sight of Alexander. Then, he hunched his shoulders and hurried behind the maid. The maid, utterly oblivious to Maxwell's action, respectfully acknowledged Alexander. "Mr. Alexander Evans."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand and said, "You may go now. I need to have a private word with Maxwell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The maid bowed and retreated. As soon as she was gone, Maxwell, now deprived of his protective barrier, spun around and tried to make a run for it. But Alexander, anticipating his move, was already blocking his path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alexander, who was half a head taller and towering like a small mountain, coming towards him, Maxwell immediately cried out in fear, "Amelia, your son is going to beat me up! Please come and save me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander watched as Maxwell opened his mouth wide and let out a piercing wail, then rolled his eyes in disdain. "I'm not interested in beating you. I just want to take you for some cheese bread."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the mention of cheese, Maxwell's gaping mouth slowly closed, and he stared at Alexander's impassive face with wide, incredulous eyes, blinking repeatedly. "How did you know I love cheese?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, with a patient smile, coaxed Maxwell, "I'm your cousin. I definitely know what you like to eat. How else can I be a good cousin?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxwell immediately found Alexander's words convincing. "So, where's the cheese bread?" he asked eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander extended his finger, beckoning Maxwell to follow. "Come with me," he instructed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Maxwell had fallen for Alexander's tricks countless times before, he completely forgot the lessons he'd learned. He trotted after Alexander into the kitchen like a little duckling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, Maxwell, his face smeared with melted cheese, ran out of the kitchen, wailing loudly, and searched for Eva everywhere. "Mommy, Alexander smeared cheese all over my face and called me an idiot..."</span></p></div>
