        <h1>Chapter 1840: Amelia Agreed</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia stared blankly at James, seemingly understanding the position he was in. She didn't blame him, instead, she held onto his hand even tighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, even if I choose not to be his granddaughter, and refuse to take his place and stand by your side... we still have to break up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her unwavering determination warmed the desolate heart of James. The more she spoke, the crueler he seemed, and the guiltier he felt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Blood ties are hard to break. The moment Matty declared you as the leader of Erebus, there was no turning back. Soon... everyone in Erebus, and your people in S, will know who you are. Do you think they would let you off the hook?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's nerves tightened even further at his words. She felt bound, trapped, unable to break free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weakly, she let go of James's hand. Her once clear eyes gradually became misty and confused, as if she was trying to see through a fog.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James' fingers moved from her soft, curly hair to her face, tracing her features as if she were a precious gem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I fear that when the time comes, I won't be able to stop myself from hurting our people if they harm you. But I'm their leader, how could I lead them if I harm them? I think it would be hard for both of us... so, is it okay if we part ways?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, you've let me down twice already. This is the third time. If we part this time, I won't look back. Are you sure about this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first time he left her because he had no choice. The second time they divorced because he was forced. The third time, he was helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was exhausting for Amelia to be abandoned repeatedly. If he was sure about his decision, she wouldn't say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his heart on his sleeve, he felt as if a hand was piercing through his chest, ripping out his bleeding heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a split second, James wanted to pull Amelia into his arms and kiss her passionately. But he had always valued rationality over impulse in the face of danger. So, he would rather endure all the pain than make such a move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never answered Amelia's question. But Amelia was stubborn, waiting for his answer, or rather, waiting for James to make a choice again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She waited a long time, only to get a nod from James. The moment she saw him </span><span>nod,</span><span> her heart started to constrict uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at the man in front of her, exuding an aura of distance. The tears wouldn't come out. It felt as if her heart had suddenly died, unable to grieve or weep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, let's part ways."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing her obedient response, James thought he could control his emotions, but his eyes turned red uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Amelia was moved. She was suffering too, but she couldn't bear to see </span><span>him upset. She couldn't help but reach out to touch James' cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be sad, I don't blame you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't blame him. She was just not going to look back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite knowing the outcome he'd </span><span>caused,</span><span> James was still heartbroken. But...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze slowly moved to Amelia's now swelling belly. If she and the baby were safe, what did it matter if they parted ways?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James remained silent. Amelia didn't know what else to say. </span><span>So</span><span> after stroking his face, she dropped her hand and said goodbye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When you go back, take care of yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't skip meals, or your gastritis will flare up. It'll be painful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And don't smoke or drink. It's not good for your health."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia said so much, but James was still as terse as ever. Realizing this, she fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staring at James' reddened eyes for a long time, Amelia gave a slight, helpless smile. Leaning on the conference table, she stood up from her chair.</span></p></div>
