        <h1>Chapter 1720 Zack disappeared too</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was surprised to see Zack also tagging along. One mission, two leaders, and the unstoppable Zack. The level of danger involved was self-evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi was clueless, but Amelia knew exactly what was going on. She had to bear this agony alone, unable to say anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe it's because I haven't been sleeping well lately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi didn't have the energy to truly care about Amelia, she just let out a sigh and followed along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I haven't been sleeping well lately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi was fed up with Zack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all because of Zack. He insisted on accompanying your husband on a business trip for some important matter, and it's been two months but he still hasn't finished it. I can't even reach him and it's been causing me so much stress. I haven't been able to sleep well and my heart is always in a state of unease."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia couldn't help but try to calm Gigi's resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In just one more month, they'll be able to come back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did your husband say that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia nodded, angering Gigi even more. She clawed at the leather sofa she was sitting on, tearing it to shreds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought the place they went to was like a secret center, where they couldn't bring phones or contact the outside world. But your husband contacted you, while that jerk Zack didn't contact me. Could he be cheating?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zack promised her to come back and marry her after six months, but now she's already two months pregnant with his child and that jerk hasn't even contacted her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;If he dares to cheat, I'll abort the baby in my belly and never see him again!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was originally staring at the sofa, but when she heard this, she suddenly raised her head and looked at Gigi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you...pregnant?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi didn't beat around the bush and just nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was discovered after Zack left."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So basically, Zack had no idea that Gigi was pregnant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was worried about Zack, but she also touched her own stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was consumed by her longing for James, feeling depressed and disinterested in everything. If it weren't for Gigi's reminder, she wouldn't have even noticed that she hadn't had her period for two months.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's been two months since her last period, she couldn't possibly...be pregnant, could she?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why do you think he hasn't contacted me?'</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Amelia started to doubt if she was pregnant, Gigi's voice snapped her back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe he's just busy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Busy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your husband is his boss, so he must be busier than him. If your husband knows to contact you, then why doesn't he know to contact me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pregnant women were sensitive, and Amelia could understand Gigi's restlessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My husband only reported his safety through someone else once. Other times, I can't reach him either."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Amelia's words, Gigi's resentment lessened a bit, but what followed was endless worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This worry was even more panic-inducing for her than the fear of Zack cheating. She always had this feeling that something might happen to Zack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia felt the same way, especially after saying goodbye to Gigi. Her heart clenched painfully, and then her fingers inexplicably cut into an A4 paper, leaving a shallow but noticeable cut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though it didn't hurt much, the sight of bright red blood flowing from the wound overlapped with the image of James lying in a pool of blood in her dream...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart tightened suddenly as the raging storm outside swept in, with dark clouds pressing down like the gates of hell opening...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One week later, Emelyn, who was far away in England, anxiously waited and heard a knock on the door. She quickly got up and opened the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coincidentally, it was also raining heavily in England. As soon as the door opened, the man outside was swept in by the wind and rain. Emelyn stood in the mist, gazing at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After recognizing who the other person was, Emelyn's heart, which had been holding on for over two months, suddenly let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Bro, you're finally back!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emelyn rushed over and hugged Holden, but her stomach hit a hard box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emelyn followed the rain and slowly looked down, and what she saw was an urn.</span></p></div>
