        <h1>Chapter 1774 Endless torture</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man in black quickly approached, holding James' hands and feet, not giving him any chance to fight back. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, if James wanted to fight back, he would have done so when 1-2 came in, but he couldn't. He had to wait for 1-1, otherwise he would never complete his mission. "According to Erebus's rules, if you break the permissions in the lower area, you will be punished with electric shocks. But for the sake of 1-1's favor, I'll do it a different way." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>1-2 nodded to the man in black, who then pushed James to the ground and took out a small knife. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After neutralizing the poison, 1-2 slowly squatted down in front of James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the mask, 1-2 used the knife to cut open the back of James' shirt, cutting slowly and steadily. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James clenched his hands tightly, his neatly trimmed nails digging into his palms, causing intense pain. But the pain was nothing compared to the knife cutting into his back. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't make a sound, just stared at the wall, thinking about Amelia being pregnant. </span><span>He imagined what their child would look like, whether they would take after him or Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he fantasized about their child, 1-2 applied more pressure with the knife, causing James to groan in pain. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily couldn't bear to see James in such agony and tried to comfort him, but he closed his eyes coldly as soon as he saw her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This action infuriated Emily. "Serves you right!" she cursed before turning to 1-2. "Sir, let me do it instead, so you don't dirty your hands." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>1-2 looked at her with disdain and continued carving James' back as if he were sculpting a work of art. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing, 1-2 handed the knife to the man in black and took a towel to wipe his hands. "Doctor, help him with the stitches, make sure he's treated properly." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor, who had been following the man in black, replied, "Yes," and quickly began treating James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His exceptional medical skills could bring someone back from the brink of death, or make them wish they were dead without anesthesia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James passed out from the pain and woke up not knowing how. He saw Emily standing outside the door, staring at him coldly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his pain, he sat up with his usual noble air, not a hair out of place. He looked as if he couldn't feel pain at all. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emily both liked and hated him more as she watched him. She wanted to torture him for not even wanting to look at her earlier. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have good news for you," Emily said as she approached James. "Amelia is dead." James froze, his face turning even paler. He looked at Emily with cold eyes, filled with murderous intent. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Emily ignored his gaze and showed him a video on her phone. "See for yourself." James' gaze shifted from Emily to the video.</span></p></div>
