        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Phil faced the snow, steadying his trembling voice, and said, "Grace, look back at me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suppressed her temper and turned around to see Phil wearing a thin shirt, standing in the snow, looking at her with grievances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace paused for a moment, then withdrew her gaze as if taking a casual glance. "Phil, I'm not interested in you anymore. Don't disturb me and my boyfriend anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finishing speaking, she hung up the phone, held Vincent's hand, and walked toward the dormitory. But he asked, "Since he's so annoying, why don't you just blacklist his number?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Grace were to blacklist him, Phil would never be able to call her again. She lowered her long eyelashes, hesitated for a few seconds, and blacklisted Phil's number in front of Vincent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Phil could not find Grace anymore, so he had been decadent for two years. He used the phone that Grace would never receive messages from and sent her messages for two years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the year she was about to graduate, Vincent betrayed Grace. Strangely enough, she, who should have been angry, was not angry but instead breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later on, Grace heard that the beauty of Imperial College was crazily pursuing Phil. Then, Grace knew why she didn't care about Vincent's infidelity. It was because the person she liked was always Phil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace was originally very arrogant and could not compromise with others. On the evening of graduation, she saw Phil again and found out that he would secretly visit her at Arcadia University as ever he had time in the past four years...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace was a bit surprised by his persistence and also questioned how Phil, who had disliked her since childhood, fell in love with her later on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't answer any of these questions. Phil only used a deep kiss to tell her about his belated love, which was also his wholehearted love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace agreed to be with Phil and was grateful that she didn't do anything out of line with Vincent. She took the bouquet and gave him another kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were only together for a year, and James found out about them. James met Phil overnight and asked him to marry Grace. Phil, who had this intention, quickly responded and proposed to Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca was already very fond of Grace. Knowing that Phil was eager to marry her, she agreed and even brought a lot of money to Blue Bay Island to prepare for the wedding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was initially shocked, but she believed that Grace would be happy to marry Phil, so she agreed. At the same time, she breathed a sigh of relief so that she would no longer have to worry about Grace living in other cities in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The older Grace grew, the more Amelia worried about it. Now that she could marry Phil, it was equivalent to relieving Amelia's worries. Amelia was satisfied with the thought of being with Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On Grace's wedding day, Amelia, who was not her mother but more like her mother, woke up early to wake up Grace, who was sleeping soundly, and then combed her hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Amelia, who was gradually wrinkling in the mirror, Grace suddenly felt like crying. "Aunt Amelia, thank you for taking care of me over the years."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia had been gentle all her life, held a comb, and helped her comb her hair while whispering softly, "Your mother has given me a new life, and I naturally want to take care of you on her behalf."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether it was because of Skender or something else, Amelia treated her well. Even her biological mother could not do it as Amelia. Grace dared not forget. "Aunt Amelia, as you and James get older, I'll take care of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia struggled not to cry with tears in her eyes. "Okay, James and I are waiting for you to take care of us..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, leaning against the door, couldn't help but be moved by this scene. Nowadays, they were all old, but the children had grown up. It would not be long before there would be life and death separations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva looked older than Amelia, stroked her tears, and walked over with her makeup box in hand. "Grace, I'll put on your makeup. Once you put it on, you can't cry anymore..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Grace hugged Amelia's waist and buried her head in her arms. "Then I'll cry for a while. Eva, can you help me with my makeup later?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva and Amelia looked at each other and smiled tearfully, "Alright, hurry up. I have to put on your makeup. Then, let Alexander carry you downstairs..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had already changed into formal attire, was standing outside the door, and impatiently urged, "If you keep crying, why don't you change the wedding date to tomorrow?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing these words, Grace stopped crying and even extended her hands like a little leopard, shouting at Alexander, "I'll laugh at you as you get married!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered, "You should behave well today and not embarrass yourself at the wedding. Otherwise, Phil would refuse you. Then, you'll become a joke within Arcadia..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace said angrily, "You, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander did not want to talk to her and turned around, only to be knocked down by a mixed-blood. With a height of nearly 5.9 feet, he stood firm and lowered his eyes, scanning Beth's reckless behavior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Friends made by fools are also fools..."</span></p></div>
