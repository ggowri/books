        <h1>Chapter 1659 Did you do something to me?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elsie, who was close to a man, quickly pushed the person away when she saw his incoming call. She made a hushing motion towards the naked man and answered the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paul, calling me this late, do you miss me?" Elsie asked with a flirtatious voice, causing Paul to suppress his impatience and frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After you dropped me off at home that night, did you do something to me?" Paul questioned. Elsie immediately realized what he meant and smirked with a hint of coldness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paul, you've got it all wrong. You should be asking if you did something to me," Elsie retorted. Paul was startled by her response but managed to keep his composure and continue his cold interrogation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I did something to you, you would have used it to blackmail me instead of leaving," he said. The next day, when there was no one in the bed, doesn't it indicate that Elsie, who had a guilty conscience, left first?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paul, I left because I knew that even if we had a relationship, you wouldn't choose me. For me, being able to be affectionate with you before your marriage was enough..." Elsie spoke with deep affection. If it were any other woman, Paul might have believed her, but how could he believe Elsie?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You better tell the truth, or else..." Paul threatened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That night, I asked if you were comfortable, and you responded. Why are you acting like you don't remember now?" Elsie's words made Paul freeze. Eva had said something similar. Could it be true?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's impossible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why is it impossible?" Elsie pouted on the couch, using a gentle voice to act coquettish towards the person on the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paul, that night, you were drunk, probably don't remember. If you don't believe me, you can check the surveillance footage..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elsie knew that Paul's place didn't have surveillance cameras to maintain secrecy. She only said this to make Paul think he really slept with her because... only she knew the truth. If she didn't tell the truth, there would be no evidence against her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling confused, Paul hung up on Elsie and had his assistant retrieve the surveillance footage from the apartment elevator. After quickly obtaining it, he saw Elsie grabbing his fingers and using his fingerprint to open the apartment door...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, Eva arrived and tried several times to enter the password incorrectly before finally opening the door after looking at her phone. When she entered, she didn't close the door, so Paul could vaguely see her slowly walking into the room...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surveillance only captured the entrance area and couldn't be seen after that. It was unknown how much time had passed when Eva ran out covering her face, appearing to have encountered something devastating. She cried heavily, trembling hands desperately pressing the elevator button, seemingly wanting to escape quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>About three hours later, Elsie, disheveled, pushed open the apartment door and stumbled out...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, holding his phone, felt powerless after watching the entire surveillance footage. He leaned against the wall next to the elevator...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that he unconsciously did something to hurt Eva that night? If that were true, there would be no possibility for him and Eva anymore...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, whether it was Elsie, the surveillance footage, or Eva's words, all indicated that he had indeed done something...</span></p></div>
