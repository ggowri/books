        <h1>Chapter 1956 Second Marriage</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon receiving the invitation and seeing the bride's name, Amelia grinned with relief. Dylan finally got what he wished for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His wedding took place on a bright night. The moonlight bathed the lawn outside the castle, while inside, an incredibly luxurious wedding was underway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan, dressed in a tailor-made black suit with a white rose on his breast, stared intently and affectionately at Michelle across from him.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was wearing a priceless white wedding dress inlaid with countless sparkling diamonds, which glistened under the light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wedding venue was packed with distinguished guests from all over the world. Everything was perfect, including the lively atmosphere, delicious food, and fine wines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With melodious music, Dylan and Michelle clasped hands and slowly walked to the sacred wedding stage. They exchanged rings, swore vows, and then...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amid the crowd's blessings, he held her head and then lowered his own to kiss her. It was a long, deep buss, as if to demonstrate that he had been waiting for all these years...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, he raised his hand and gently touched the little flower girl next to him, Michelle's daughter, Beth. He said, "I will no longer be your uncle but your father, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beth had witnessed Alan's abuse of both Michelle and herself since childhood, resulting in her deep fear of the role of a father. However, she could accept it if Dylan was to be her father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because, in Beth's impression, despite consistently disregarding Michelle, he always showed kindness whenever they met, discreetly offering her money and visiting her at school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beth understood that Dylan truly cared for Michelle yet struggled to express it. Now that his hopes of marrying her had been realized, Beth, as her daughter, would naturally bless them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a smile, she nodded under Dylan's big palm. "Okay, I will call you Daddy from now on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beaming with joy, Dylan shifted his gaze from Beth to Michelle, who was in tears. He raised his fingers, tenderly brushed away her tears, and then enveloped her in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they embraced each other, fireworks exploded brilliantly outside the castle, illuminating the night sky. Moonlight, starlight, and pyrotechnic light all intermingled into one beautiful picture, all shining on the three on the wedding stage.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amidst the breathtaking view, Dylan held Michelle's hand with one hand and Beth's hand with the other. He looked up at the night sky with them. At that moment, he couldn't help but sigh that his perseverance had finally led to marrying his true love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, seated in the guest section, wore a smile of relief. It was profoundly moving that Dylan became husband and wife with his beloved girl in such an atmosphere. As a result, she gradually shed tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Motionless, James kept his eyes on her except for a glance at the fireworks. Seeing her wiping tears foolishly, he couldn't help but find it funny. "You were not so moved when I got married."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite laughing at her, he had already put his fingers on her face, brushing away the tears. His actions hinted at a tenderness and affection that surpassed even Dylan's on the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia pulled out a tissue and blew her nose before lifting her head and retorting to James, "It seems as if you were very touched when I got married."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most prominent local nobleman, who was sitting in the same row with them, overheard their conversation and poked his head out to ask, "Is it also your second marriage?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Amelia lowered her head in embarrassment. James raised his bushy eyebrows slightly and glanced at her meaningfully. "Not at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nobleman was puzzled. "Is it your third marriage?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James reached out and grabbed Amelia's waist, pulling her into his arms. "It's my first marriage."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nobleman looked at Amelia. "Is it your third marriage?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nestled her head awkwardly in James' arms. "Well, yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nobleman desired to ask more questions, but James cast a gloomy and cold glance at him. Feeling a chill run down his neck, the nobleman suppressed his curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia patted James' hand on her waist. "Don't be so fierce. Otherwise, it will be bad if Dylan offends someone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James sneered, his eyes full of contempt. Next to him, Alexander wore a similar expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's disdain wasn't directed at the nobleman but at Grace, who was already twelve years old. She could not sit quietly, ordering delicious food and fine wine from time to time. While indulging in her meal and drink, she asked if Alexander would like to have some.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was so annoyed that he stood up and tried to leave several times, but James stopped him every time. "The wedding isn't over yet. Sit still."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With powerful strength, James used just one hand to push Alexander's small frame back into the chair, rendering him immobile. Alexander had no choice but to lean back in the chair, wishing for the wedding to conclude swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the wedding had only just reached the bouquet-throwing process, and guests would be invited to take photos on stage later. It was still going to be a while. When Alexander's patience ran out, Beth descended from the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the bouquet-throwing process had nothing to do with a little girl like her, so she naturally had to return to the VIP seat, which had been ingeniously arranged next to Grace.</span></p></div>
