        <h1>Chapter 1210 What is the result of the appraisal?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the values displayed on the report, Amelia's anxious heart finally relaxed, "It seems like Herb didn't lie to me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, she held onto the report and turned to J</span><span>ames</span><span>, pointing to the values excitedly, "Honey, look, there's no relationship between us at all. Aren't you relieved?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>J</span><span>ames</span><span>, unsure whether to be relieved or not, glanced at S</span><span>tella</span><span>'s "calm" face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze seemed to be asking S</span><span>tella</span><span> whether the report was true or false.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, S</span><span>tella</span><span> pretended not to see and kept staring at her own toes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>J</span><span>ames</span><span> couldn't ask directly in front of A</span><span>melia</span><span>, so he had to endure it for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A</span><span>melia</span><span> became even more nervous when she saw J</span><span>ames&rsquo;</span><span> reaction to the report, thinking he was acting strange, "What's wrong with you? Isn't this the result you wanted?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>S</span><span>tella</span><span>, who was standing next to them with her arms crossed on the desk, almost laughed when she heard this, "J</span><span>ames</span><span> definitely wanted this result, otherwise he wouldn't have..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>J</span><span>ames</span><span> grabbed A</span><span>melia</span><span>'s hand and pulled her towards the door, "The report is out, let's go back first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A</span><span>melia</span><span> still wanted to talk to S</span><span>tella</span><span> for a while longer, "We don't have to rush back, I still want to spend more time with S</span><span>tella</span><span>..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time S</span><span>tella</span><span> had seen J</span><span>ames</span><span> "fleeing" like this, and she didn't mind watching the show, "Yeah, A</span><span>melia</span><span>, I still have something to tell you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing that Stella had something to tell her, Amelia quickly stopped in her tracks and said, "Honey, why don't you go back first? I'll go back with Peter later, is that okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was happy about the report and looked like a little girl with her hands clasped together on her chest and starry eyes, saying, "With Peter accompanying me, nothing will happen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James wasn't afraid that something would happen to her, he was afraid that Stella would speak without a filter. But seeing his wife's hopeful expression, he hesitated for a few seconds before coldly looking at Stella and saying, "You come out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being a man who always responded to Amelia's requests, James finally couldn't hold back and asked Stella to come out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that James couldn't hold back anymore, Stella smiled and said, "Amelia, James probably has something to tell me. Wait for me for a while."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't suspect anything and kept flipping through the report, and no one could feel how happy she was at the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of this report, it meant that she could be with James openly and honestly for the rest of her life without violating any morals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the VIP room, James, who was unhappy, sat on the sofa and coldly asked Stella, </span><span>"What is the appraisal result?"</span></p></div>
