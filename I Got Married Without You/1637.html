        <h1>Chapter 1637 Eva met Kate</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, who was about to release Paul from the blacklist, instinctively answered the </span><span>unfamiliar phone call. "Ms. Miller, hello. I am Paul's mother. Would you like to go out for a cup of coffee?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva's hand holding the phone tightened suddenly. Paul had just mentioned informing his parents, and now his mother was calling. She was fast, but... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva could guess the purpose of this call from Paul's mother, and she didn't really want to go. However, since it concerned their marriage, it was normal for his parents to be cautious. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hesitating for a while, Eva finally agreed with a "yes." Kate immediately sent her the address and asked her to meet there. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva chose a conservative outfit, put on light makeup, and got into her car. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she parked outside the caf&eacute;, she happened to see a classy woman stepping out of a luxury car. With just a glance, Eva knew who she was. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The younger generation of the Evans Family inherited excellent genes from their parents. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's mother was one of those people, with an elegant appearance and graceful figure. She exuded an air of sophistication, making it hard to determine her age. It was no wonder Paul and Edith looked so good. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva waited until the graceful figure entered the caf&eacute; before getting out of her car. Standing in front of the door, she involuntarily swallowed several mouthfuls of saliva. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some reason, she had never been this nervous when meeting Jayden's parents... Her heart was pounding incessantly, and she couldn't control its crazy frequency. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt incredibly nervous and anxious, lingering outside for a while before finally mustering the courage to push open the door. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate probably recognized her with a quick glance. "Ms. Miller, over here." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva tugged at her stiff lips and walked over with a smile. "Mrs. Evans, hello."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate greeted Eva to take a seat. "Ms. Miller, what would you like to drink?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva took the menu handed to her by the waiter and chose a coffee she often drank. She showed no signs of nervousness or pretense, which surprised Kate. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Eva finished ordering, she waved her hand, and the waiter immediately left. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the waiter was gone, Kate looked at Eva more closely, from top to bottom. Eva had a good face and figure. It had to be said that she took good care of herself, which was why her age was not apparent. However, despite her good appearance, she was still three years older than Paul. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate looked down on Eva a bit but didn't show it on her face. "Ms. Miller, my son surprisingly came home today and said he wants to marry you. I haven't even met you yet, so I took the liberty to call and invite you out. I hope you don't mind?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva shook her head. "I don't mind. It's only natural." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva was always obedient and well-behaved in front of elders, so Kate continued to prod her. "Could you tell me about you and Paul?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva thought she was trying to prevent their marriage, but Kate didn't immediately get to the point. "What specific things do you want to know?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate, elegantly leaning back in her armchair, slightly pursed her lips. "I want to know if you love him or not." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a bit embarrassing for Eva to talk about love in front of someone's mother. But </span><span>after confirming her feelings, she bravely admitted, "He's great, and I really like him." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate asked if she loved him, but Eva answered that she liked him. In the eyes of older generations, this answer was not ideal. "So, you don't love him then?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva opened her mouth to retort, but Kate interrupted her. "Ms. Miller, my son has no experience with marriage, but you have plenty. So, you should be familiar with the process, right?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no direct sarcasm, but it still carried a hint of irony. Eva felt embarrassed and lowered her head. "I know." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her discomfort, Kate finally got to the point. "As the groom's parents, it is natural for us to negotiate with the bride's parents. Do you know where your parents are?"</span></p></div>
