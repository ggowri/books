        <h1>Chapter 1938 Me and my baby can't be without you</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia forced a bitter smile. "James, you always downplay your injuries, but what you've been through could have killed you. Yet you always keep it from me and don't tell me anything."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Amelia entered, she crouched down and James didn't see the blood on her until she stood up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body stiffened, and in an instant, he got up from the bed and embraced her, barely keeping her from falling.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Doctor!" he shouted, carrying Amelia and calling for a doctor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Amelia stopped him. "Compared to the pain that chip has caused you, my pain is nothing. Let me share your pain."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James furrowed his thick eyebrows, understanding Amelia's meaning.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but lower his gaze, helplessly looking at the woman in his arms. "I admit it. Let the doctor come in and help stop the bleeding, okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that she had forced him to admit it, Amelia suddenly hugged his neck and buried her head in his neck. "What should I do? How can I help you remove the chip?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James raised his slender fingers and gently patted Amelia's waist. "Don't be afraid. a small chip can't take me away from you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia couldn't believe such words meant for comforting a child. "Matty said that chip has a virus. Who knows when it will erupt? I'm really scared, scared of losing you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she learned of his death before, Amelia had felt like dying herself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The feeling of losing a loved one was truly painful, and she didn't want to experience it again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was also afraid that she wouldn't have time to leave with him and went crazy first.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man who seemed indifferent to life gently patted her back while tenderly comforting her. "I don't care how long I live. I only care about you and our child. As long as you both are well, I don't mind trading my life."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia slowly moved away from James' neck and looked into his eyes. "You are my pillar of strength. I can't be without you, and our baby can't be without a father. So, please don't say such things anymore."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After firmly stating her position, Amelia hugged James tightly again. "Don't worry, as long as I'm alive, I will definitely search for top doctors everywhere to remove your chip. That way, you can be with me and our baby forever."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being tightly embraced by her, the man felt the intense love and reluctance from the woman.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some reason, he, who lacked a sense of security, suddenly curved his lips and showed a faint smile. "Alright."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of embracing each other, James sat back on the hospital bed, slowly with Amelia in his arms.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, he would have held her like this all the time, but his knees couldn't handle it anymore. Standing for a while caused excruciating pain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sitting back on the bed, he reached out and pressed the button, and the doctor quickly came in, helping Amelia stop the bleeding and adding another bed to the room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia forcefully removed the tubes, undoubtedly burdening her still recovering body once again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the burden of resolving the tension between them was something Amelia could bear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She still needed treatment for the time being, and James' knee and the chip embedded deeper in his brain, causing dizziness, also needed treatment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, the two of them stayed in the hospital.</span></p></div>
