        <h1>Chapter 1961 Why Did She Like Jackson</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith was getting older yet had not yet married. Kate was anxious, fearing that she would be too old to have a child. So, she was busy selecting young men from good families for Edith and hoped that she would go on blind dates through Eric.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith either refused or politely declined during blind dates. After so many times, Edith became impatient and went back to her parent's place, telling Kate to stop doing those meaningless things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the years, Edith had seldom returned home. Every time she came back, it was because Eric pretended to be sick that she came back reluctantly. She apparently hadn't let go of what had happened and didn't intend to forgive Kate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate was feeling more and more regretful. When she saw Edith, she was always careful and even spoke in a low voice. "Edith, when you get old and don't have children, you will feel lonely and regretful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith, sitting on the couch, sneered, "The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. I don't want to become a vicious mom who will separate my children. I'd better not to have children so as not to let them inherit such genes. Or, it would only harm them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate, who had spent her life dealing with the wealthy families, could hear the irony in her remarks. However, she had indeed done wrong things back then, so Kate could only endure her mockery. "Edith, I just want to see you get married before I die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith sneered, "When I was with Anthony, you didn't agree and tried every means to secretly divide us. Now, you're urging me to get married. Aren't you ashamed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate was speechless. It was said that one would be punished for his mistakes, but Kate didn't expect that the retribution would come so soon. Moreover, the one who took revenge on her was her daughter. Kate felt very upset.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She covered her stuffy chest and stared at the indifferent Edith for a long while. Then, she said cautiously, "I heard that you seemed to have fallen in love with someone else. How are you guys doing now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Edith blamed her and never forgave her, Kate hoped that Edith could find a good man to rely on so that she could die happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith held the phone, paused for a moment, and denied, "He doesn't like me, so don't get any ideas."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a pause, Edith looked at Kate coldly and continued, "I'm not meant to get the love I want, so stop bothering me anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Edith stood up and left. Looking at her stubborn figure, Kate took a long sigh. She had to live with the consequences of what she had done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It rained heavily on the day Edith returned to Imperial Capital. She went home in the rain and cooked herself spaghetti. Then, she went to the floor-to-ceiling window, put the spaghetti on the table, and sat down cross-legged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While watching the rain, Edith ate spaghetti alone, conjuring up the image of Jackson rejecting her. It happened three years ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Jackson was sitting in the garden reading a book. Edith looked at his figure and couldn't help but walk to his side. Then, she bent down and, like when she was pursuing Anthony, summoned her courage and said she liked him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her recollection was hazy, but Edith still remembered that when she said that, Jackson's face fell instantly, and his cold gaze moved away from the book and set on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She remembered clearly that Jackson said, "Ms. Evans, please don't come to my house anymore from now on. I will ask Zoey to pay you all the medical bills."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith didn't expect Jackson to be so heartless. She thought that after they spent so much time together, Jackson would have feelings for her. Even if he didn't have romantic feelings, he would be kind for the sake of her care for him. However, Jackson wasn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He only regarded Edith as a rehabilitation therapist and a psychological counselor for depression. When Edith turned her feelings into affection for him, he immediately and ruthlessly drove her away, refused her treatment, and even stopped seeing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith was once unwilling to give in and proposed to Jackson that she stay with him for three years. If Jackson still didn't like her within three years, she wouldn't bother him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Jackson firmly told Edith that he would only love one person in his life. Edith said, "Then give it a try and see if you really will only love one person." Jackson probably didn't want Edith to bother him anymore, so he agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, three years had gone by. Not only had Jackson not fallen in love with Edith, but he had proved that no one could replace Amelia. Edith gave up. She kept her promise and stopped bothering Jackson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But occasionally, she would drive and park before Jackson's house, then gaze at the house from afar and fall into deep thought, wondering why she liked Jackson.</span></p></div>
