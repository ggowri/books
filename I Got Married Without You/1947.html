        <h1>Chapter 1947 Matty died</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the news of Matty's death came, Amelia was holding the baby, accompanying Grace with her homework.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace's academic performance was not very good, especially in math.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't even solve basic arithmetic problems, just like Amelia when she was studying.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Amelia could still help with elementary school questions, so she patiently guided Grace while cuddling Alexander in her arms.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Grace scratching her head in confusion, Alexander couldn't help but make a few grunting sounds.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, Grace didn't pay much attention, thinking that the baby was just making strange noises.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after the fifth time, Grace felt that something was off. She raised her round eyes and studied Alexander.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, who was playing with a pen absentmindedly, felt Grace's gaze and suddenly tilted his head, raised his chin at her, and stared at her with his nose. "Hmph&mdash;"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Grace heard it clearly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised her chubby little hand and pointed at the arrogant Alexander, loudly accusing, "Auntie, Alexander is provoking me!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could that be? Alexander is only one year old and doesn't understand anything, let alone provoking..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace pointed at Alexander, stomping her feet anxiously. "Auntie, look quickly! He not only stared at me with his nostrils, but also mocked me with his eyes..." When Amelia looked away from her book and towards him, Alexander quickly put on an expression of ignorance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when Amelia pulled him to look at her, he deliberately picked up the pen in his hand and gave Amelia a silly smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace was frightened by the sudden change in the one-year-old baby. "Auntie, your baby is a little scary..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you feeling overwhelmed with schoolwork and stressed? Let Auntie take you out for a walk to relax."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace, who had been staring at Alexander, shook her head resolutely. "No need, I want to stay at home and accompany Alexander, see if he wets the bed at night..." As soon as she finished speaking, Alexander smiled, without making a sound.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Grace clearly saw a sinister and mocking expression in that smile. "Uncle, help me! I don't find your son cute at all now..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace threw her pen and ran scared into the study, coincidentally bumping into James who was coming out. Grace bumped into him and her whole body bounced back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, a slender and powerful hand grabbed her collar, lifted her up, and after she stood firm, Grace wanted to complain, but when she looked up and saw James' serious face, she immediately understood and moved aside to make way.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James walked up to Amelia and told her the news he had just received. "Matty died from an injection at Sophia's grave and left all his personal belongings to you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, who was still sorting out the children's clothes, paused for two seconds when she heard this, then looked at the man who had already sat down beside her. "How could he suddenly..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James lowered his gaze and looked at the child who was obediently playing with a pen. "Dylan said he had finished everything he needed to do and had no attachment to this world anymore."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a pause, James looked at Amelia, who had a somewhat complex expression. "Before he died, he arranged for a doctor to help me stabilize the chip in my brain."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't have much emotional attachment to Matty's death.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't grow up in the Lawrence family, and coupled with what happened before, she always resented Matty.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But later, her life was saved by Matty, and it was he who used the children to stimulate her to regain her memory.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he found a doctor who could stabilize the chip in James' brain. Amelia's emotions changed slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then again, the chip in James' brain was originally related to Matty. Even if Matty died, Amelia wasn't sad, she just felt sorry for James and what he went through in Erebus...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sorting out her emotions in her heart, Amelia picked up the baby. "Honey, tell Dylan that I don't accept Matty's personal belongings. Let him keep them for himself."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James nodded slightly and said to Amelia, "Dylan said we won't be invited to the funeral, but if you want to go back home, you can go back anytime. That small courtyard will always be there for you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Except for Matty, Amelia had a good relationship with the two uncles, three cousins, and even the aunt and sister-in-law who married into the Lawrence family. She was still willing to maintain those relationships. "Then we'll go when we have time."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James agreed with a "okay" and his gentle and affectionate gaze swept across Amelia's face, landing on the chubby little face of the baby.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grace has been pestering to sleep with the baby, let them sleep together tonight..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The baby, who was playing with the pen, shook the pen and then looked up at James with big innocent eyes, as if melting like winter snow.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed to be contemplating James' intention to keep him away.</span></p></div>
