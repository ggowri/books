        <h1>Chapter 1729 Destroy Erebus</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter nodded and told her to stay at home and wait for James to come back. Grace, being very understanding, said, "I will definitely be a good girl and wait for Uncle James to come back. He promised to be there for me as I grow up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter looked up and gazed at the sun setting over the mountains. He could only hope that Mr. Shawn would disappear like the setting sun, only to rise again at dawn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stayed with the child, waiting for the people inside the house to come out. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a car pulled up outside and Frank, who was guarding the door, snapped out of his daze when he heard the honking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He struggled to stand up with his old body and looked at the person sitting in the car. After recognizing who it was, Frank reached out his trembling hand and pressed the release button.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he had already guessed that James had passed away, just like Peter, Frank still held onto James' last words and promised to take care of Amelia no matter what, even if it meant dedicating his entire life to her and making sure she never faced any harm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though his heart was filled with sorrow, Frank still stayed on Blue Bay Island, fulfilling his duties and silently accompanying the only remaining lady here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car that was let through sped past the garden and into the castle gates at a breakneck speed. Suddenly, it came to a halt and the passenger door opened. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew, dressed in all black, quickly stepped out of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Peter!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew's face turned pale as he stormed over to Peter and grabbed him by the collar, lifting him up from his chair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why didn't you tell me about Mr. Evans going to Erebus earlier?!'</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this period, Andrew stayed in Imperial Capital to eliminate the Simpson family. He did not receive any news from Mr. Evans about going to Erebus. He only knew that Mr. Evans was going on a business trip to Europe, so he thought he had actually left. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, in the past, Mr. Evans would go on short trips for three months or long trips for six months. Who would have thought that Mr. Evans would actually go to Erebus!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could you keep this dangerous thing from me for three months when he went to do it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Andrew had known earlier that Mr. Evans was going to Erebus, he would have definitely gone with him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter lifted his dark red eyes, glaring at Andrew with equal anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the point of you going? You'll just end up like Zack, dead inside!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least there will be one more person to protect Mr. Evans!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter's lips curled into a smirk as he let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even Zack couldn't escape, let alone you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew wasn&rsquo;t even part of S, he was just James' assistant. Did he really think he can make a difference by going there?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew clenched his fists tightly and punched Peter in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I may not be as good as Zack, but I won't hide here and play with kids like you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Peter's anger surged within him and he clenched his fist, ready to strike back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew, who had also been punched, refused to back down and grabbed Peter by the collar, </span><span>delivering another punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter immediately became furious and broke free from Andrew's grasp. The two of them started to unleash their anger on each other, throwing punches back and forth. Each blow was aimed at the other with intense force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace, who was sitting on a chair next to them, watched the two of them wrestling on the lawn and somehow found the courage to yell at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop hitting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The piercing screams of a child echoed through the air, causing the two burly men to slowly cease their violence and weakly release each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two bruised and swollen men sat on the lawn, their backs to the setting sun, their heavy heads hanging down as they stared blankly at their bruised hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of silence, Peter spoke in a calm tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your wife is pregnant, and James doesn't want to burden you. As for Zack, he secretly followed them on his own."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew's body trembled as a wave of sorrow washed over him, causing his eyes to well up with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter, who had calmed down, slowly turned his head to look at Andrew, whose mouth was oozing with blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James is the leader of S, so he has to go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew remained silent and didn't respond. After a long time, he finally spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I grew up with him since I was young, how could I not understand him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just couldn't accept that powerful James died so tragically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew sat for a while longer, then quickly stood up from the lawn, pushing aside his feelings of sadness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to destroy Erebus!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned around and pulled out a gun from his waist, removed the safety, and quickly walked out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peter stared at the stubborn figure for a few seconds before helplessly getting up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rushed over at lightning speed, raised his hand, and struck Andrew's back neck with a palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, I promised Mr. Shawn that I wouldn't let anyone around him take risks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After knocking Andrew down, Peter lifted the tall and muscular man and placed him in the car...</span></p></div>
