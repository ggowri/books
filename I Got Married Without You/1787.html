        <h1>Chapter 1787 Emily shot Brandon</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't seen anything from Carson's eyes, and was pulled back by the incredible Emily. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, what he said, is it true?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Brandon could only nod in agreement. "She is the child of my first wife." Knowing that Emily had a previous wife, she felt a lump in her throat, as she hadn't expected that Amelia would turn out to be her half-sister. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she had seen Brandon push Amelia and her mother off the ship when she was a child, and they should have died, so how were they still alive? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, you didn't kill them back then, did you?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to the bombshell news that hit Emily, Brandon was obviously much more rational. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Emily, go out first, and I'll explain to you slowly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Emily was unreasonable, and pushed Brandon away. "Get out of my way!" After pushing Brandon away, she grabbed the table leg and forced herself up from the ground. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was extremely disappointed, and looked at Brandon, then turned around and </span><span>looked around for a gun. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, she rushed to Carson, snatched the gun from his waist, and aimed it directly at Brandon's chest. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, I didn't expect that you would not help me kill her, ruining my big plan, then... go to hell!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the moment the bullet was fired, Carson raised his foot, kicked Emily, and quickly took back his gun. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My gun was almost dirtied." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson wiped the gun with his clothes. Emily, who had lost her mind, rushed over and wanted to fight Carson. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson raised his foot again, kicked Emily to the ground. "You even want to kill your own </span><span>father,</span><span> I think you shouldn't live either!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson raised the gun in his hand, wanting to shoot her, but was stopped by 1-1. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leave her alive for now." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson was a little puzzled, as 1-1 had clearly wanted to kill Emily just now, so why the sudden change of heart? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lock her up, we'll talk about it later." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson rubbed the carpet with his foot and looked down at Brandon. "What about him?" "Keep him locked up too." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After giving the order, someone took the Moore father and daughter away. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Emily was being dragged away, she was still shouting about her contributions to Erebus, making it clear that 1-1 was going to punish her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a single glance, 1-1 grabbed the black-clothed man, raised his hand, and slapped the back of her neck. Emily's eyes rolled back, and she fainted. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Brandon was not so much heartbroken as he was disappointed, and turned his head. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they were taken away, 1-1 raised his deep eyes and looked at Carson. "Everyone else leave, you stay." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson just stopped in his tracks. He turned around and looked at 1-1 through the people who were leaving the control room. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After everyone had left, 1-1 crushed the cigarette in his hand and motioned for Carson to sit down. "Sit down." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carson didn't know what he was going to do, and was a little nervous, but he sat down next to 1-1 without showing it. "Your sister </span><span>Sumasa's</span><span> marriage, I've heard a little about it, but I don't know the details, can you tell me?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His family's secrets, Carson had never told anyone, but 1-1 knew even about his sister's marriage, which meant the other party had investigated it long ago. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hesitating for two seconds, Carson briefly explained how </span><span>Sumasa</span><span> was disfigured, divorced, and married, and then killed by a shipwreck after her marriage. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, </span><span>Sumasa</span><span> was starved to death?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After suffering from hunger and cold, she died on the streets of England." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Carson said this, his eyes couldn't help but turn red. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't transferred the money to Ashley, but had given it directly to </span><span>Sumasa</span><span>, perhaps </span><span>Sumasa</span><span> could have survived with her child. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But who would have thought that Ashley, who had always been gentle and kind, would take the money he gave her and buy a bag, then throw it to a beggar...</span></p></div>
