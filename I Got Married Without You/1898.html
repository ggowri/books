        <h1>Chapter 1898 I'm sorry</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James looked at the face that was identical to Zack's and was momentarily stunned, as if he had seen Zack crawl out of a snake pit and stumble towards him, saying, "Mr. Shawn, I managed to crawl out of that hellhole. Impressive, right?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had hoped for such an ending, even his dreams had played it out that way. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the indifferent gaze in the person's eyes was not the same as Zack's, who, despite going through hardships, still shone brightly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the contrary, there was a sense of detachment from worldly matters. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With just one glance, James could distinguish between Zack and Zenith. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But because of that same face, there was still a glimmer of hope in James' heart. He spoke, albeit faintly, "I've been looking for you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing James' voice, Gigi, who was holding a cup of honey water, turned pale. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a hint of anger in her eyes, but her newfound faith had made her less impulsive. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suppressed her anger and turned to face James, who had already entered with Amelia. "If Zack hadn't returned safely, I would have killed you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Gigi, James felt even more guilty. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zack should have been the one to accompany his loved ones and children through a lifetime of happiness, but because of him, Zack had left this world. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the person who loved Zack would forever live in pain. In James' cold and distant eyes, a hint of deep-rooted remorse appeared. "I'm sorry." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sorry for causing her to lose her husband, and sorry that Zack hadn't returned. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he couldn't bring himself to say the latter, as who could be so heartless as to shatter Gigi's remaining hope? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sometimes, a blissful ignorance was the key to a life without regrets, let her continue to believe that Zenith was Zack. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, how could she continue living? What would she hold on to? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing James' remorse in his eyes was rare, Gigi had wanted to use that guilt to strike at James, but when she saw Amelia's pregnant belly, she held back her harsh words. "You're pregnant?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia raised her hand and gently touched her belly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, she felt guilty. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had her child and her husband by her side, while Gigi had lost both Zack and her child. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed unfair to Gigi. She didn't know how to face Gigi. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi smiled, her lips curling up, and a sense of relief in her eyes. "If my child hadn't been miscarried, they would be the same age as yours. But it's okay, Zack and I will have more children in the future." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, she kindly reminded Amelia, "You're already in the late stages of pregnancy. You don't need to make a special trip to see Zack. Take care of yourself so that the baby can be comfortable in your belly." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing these gentle words, Amelia lowered her gaze in shame. "Gigi, I'm sorry. If it weren't for me, your child wouldn't have..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Amelia's face, Gigi remembered the scene where she had poured hot soup on Amelia during her madness. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to Amelia, she felt even more guilty. "It has nothing to do with you. It was my own bad temper, my own self-inflicted tragedy that caused the loss of the child." Gigi finished speaking and seemed unwilling to dwell on the past. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood up from her chair and made room for them. "Catch up with Zack. I'll go back first." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lifted her skirt and walked past James without looking at him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as she brushed past him, she heard James whispering another apology. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigi didn't pay it any mind and raised her hand, pointing at Zenith. "The person you should apologize to is Zack." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, she walked away with long strides. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she left, Zenith withdrew his gentle gaze and looked at the two standing in the courtyard. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He politely gestured, "If you don't mind, please sit down and have some tea." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zack didn't like tea; he only liked strong coffee because it kept him alert. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Mr. Shawn gave him a mission, he needed to be ready to go at a moment's notice. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James caught sight of the serene tea cup and tea leaves and wondered if he could have lived as contentedly as Zenith if Zack hadn't been sent away on that ship. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would he have been able to live without licking the blade alongside Zack? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were no answers; no one could trace back the past. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could only live in the present. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, everything and everyone was beautiful in the past, as memories were shrouded in a hazy mist, and what was remembered was all that was beautiful. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James helped Amelia sit down across from Zenith. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't speak much, but from Zenith's calm demeanor, James could tell he was different from others. "On the way here, Johnny told me about Zack's background. I didn't expect him to be your brother." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After pouring tea for both of them, Zenith smiled lightly. "I thought you would mistake me for Zack, just like Gigi did. I was wondering how I should explain."</span></p></div>
