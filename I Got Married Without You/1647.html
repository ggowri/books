        <h1>Chapter 1647 Stay single forever</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing his troublesome and demanding son, Eric began to complain to Kate: "I told you, let him marry Eva, but you insisted on meddling. Now, here I am, at this age, still doing housework."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate, who was also trying to cook in the kitchen, glanced at Eric unexpectedly and retorted, "You're always compromising."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not that I'm compromising. You let them figure it out themselves. By interfering so much, what if we end up discouraging Paul from getting married?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's so outstanding, there are plenty of women who want to marry him. How could he possibly stay single forever?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Outstanding?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric turned around and looked at Paul, who was sitting in the living room with an air of arrogance. As his father, Eric couldn't feel any of his supposed excellence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My dear."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric shifted his gaze back and reached out, tugging at Kate's hem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For my sake, why don't you... apologize to Ms. Miller?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate took a glass of water and poured it into the pot on the stove, causing the flames to suddenly flare up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Eric quickly grabbed the pot lid and covered the flames, extinguishing them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You see, you can't even cook properly. You don't even understand basic common sense. What if something bad happened? Just go apologize."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing her husband constantly urging her to apologize to someone else, Kate became furious. "Why should I apologize to her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate lifted the lid and glanced at the burned food in the pot. It was completely ruined and inedible. Suppressing her anger, she poured the food out and started over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want to cook either. Paul wouldn't let them order takeout and insisted she cook herself. Throughout her life, this was the first time Kate had cooked...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt frustrated and angry, but there was nothing she could do. He was her own son, so she had to endure it and grit her teeth, while also advising Eric to do the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's the president of the North American region now, with so many </span><span>company</span><span> matters to attend to. He can't just idle around at home all the time. Just endure a little longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate thought to herself, endure a little and it will pass. Little did she know that Paul would bring his work into their home, working from home every day...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul made it clear that if Kate didn't apologize, he would keep living with them and continue to oppose the two older adults.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Eric couldn't bear it anymore and called Edith, hoping she could come back and talk to Paul. But Edith simply hung up the phone...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the dark screen, Eric shed some tears. After breaking ties with the family, his daughter had never come back. Even when he went to visit her, she avoided him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric felt a deep sense of unease. His daughter didn't want to come home, and his son caused trouble when he did. The once warm and lively home was completely destroyed by Kate's interference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eric also started to resent Kate. Many times, when she spoke to him, Eric ignored her...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over time, Kate also became worn out by the torment, but she still refused to give in to Paul's unreasonable demands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith thought that Kate would have learned from her own experiences and give her </span><span>brother a way out, but she still intervened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want to return to the old house or talk to Kate, but she still hoped to help her brother with his problems, so she turned to James for help at the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although James was the head of the Evans Family, he never interfered in personal matters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edith found it difficult to speak up, but James didn't mind and casually responded, "I will go talk to them. You go back first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was aware of Paul's mother contacting Ms. Miller and the recent torture Paul was inflicting on his parents, but he didn't immediately intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no other reason, mainly because he wanted Paul to torment his parents a little longer, so they wouldn't recklessly bully his wife's sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't want to get involved in such matters, but with Edith showing up at his door, he had no choice but to intervene.</span></p></div>
