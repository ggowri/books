        <h1>Chapter 1756 Come here, let me hug you</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny</span><span> was much more rational than Amelia, and he immediately pulled her up. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't look down, choose first!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was loud enough to bring Amelia's thoughts back. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She steadied her mind and stared at the box in front of her, slowly reaching out her hand. The box was sealed shut and couldn't be opened, and the four types of insects inside were all lightweight, making it impossible to tell what was inside. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she anxiously hesitated, the player next to her randomly pressed the button labeled 'butterfly' because time was running out. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The box opened, and instead of a butterfly, a moth flew out, and at the same time, the floor beneath him instantly opened up. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't standing on the circular position, so when he turned and ran, he didn't fall directly like the scarred man. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought he had escaped by running out of the game room, but as soon as he took a step out, the floor beneath his feet suddenly opened up. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without warning, he fell, and at the same time, the adjacent floor opened up one by one. Amelia only now understood why no one could walk out of the nine rounds of the game smoothly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that the punishment for each round was deadly, and no one could escape. "5, 4..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia!" </span><span>Johnny</span><span>'s voice rang in her ears again, and Amelia, as if she had made up her mind, pressed the button labeled &ldquo;butterfly&rdquo; directly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The box opened, and a blue butterfly flew out, flapping its wings as if it had found freedom, and flew up into the sky. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After confirmed that Amelia had chosen correctly, </span><span>Johnny</span><span> finally let out a sigh of relief and pressed the button in the last second of the mechanical sound. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the moment he pressed the button, Amelia didn't dare to look, covering her eyes and stepping back. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the sound of the floor opening did not come, instead, </span><span>Johnny</span><span>'s clear and loud voice came. "Amelia." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing his voice, Amelia slowly opened her eyes and saw </span><span>Johnny</span><span> leaning against the console, smiling at her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He actually looked pretty good, bright and clean, and when he smiled, the dimples on his cheeks were very charming. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that safe and sound smile, Amelia burst into tears of joy. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny</span><span> opened his arms and said to her, "</span><span>Come here, let me hug you</span><span>." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the second round of the game ended, Amelia found the handcuff key in the luggage compartment, and the two of them smiled at each other and hugged. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the second time we've experienced life and death." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Scar assisting, they didn't feel any danger at all, only these two times were real. After </span><span>Johnny</span><span> hugged Amelia, the dimples on his cheeks became even deeper. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it was just a comfort after the ordeal, for him, it was enough for a lifetime. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you hadn't chosen correctly just now, I was ready to go down in your place." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After so many rounds of the game, </span><span>Johnny</span><span> had already figured out the rules. No matter which round of the game, someone had to be punished in order for it to end. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> he would rather go down himself than watch Amelia fall. </span><span>Johnny</span><span>'s words touched Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She patted </span><span>Johnny</span><span>'s back and said softly, "No one is worth you sacrificing your life, </span><span>Johnny</span><span>, you have to be okay." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are worth it." For some reason, the answer </span><span>Johnny</span><span> gave in his heart was these words. He really was like James, falling in love with someone and willing to do anything for her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the backstage viewing area, Cobra stared at the two embracing figures and slowly collapsed onto the sofa. He clenched his fingers until they bled, then slowly released them... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>2-7 turned his head and looked at the cold Cobra with blood dripping from his fingers. "The people I invited and the people Venom invited are quite lucky to have passed this level." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, 2-7 sneered. "I wonder if they can survive the next two levels." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cobra ignored her, and his eyes under the mask were as dark as ink, as tense as ever. He kept recalling the program he had rewritten in 1-2. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could crack the programming in the 1-1 game area and gain permission to go down, then he could see them... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But all he knew now was the locked gameplay programming in 1-2, and he didn't know what the program was that cracked the permissions.</span></p></div>
