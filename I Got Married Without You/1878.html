        <h1>Chapter 1878 Amelia hugged James</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, held in James' arms, trembled all over, but gradually calmed down when she smelled his familiar scent. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She slowly lifted her eyes and looked at the man with a refined jawline, while the man lowered his long eyelashes and looked at her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their eyes, they saw each other's faces, one pale and the other determined, neither of them looking away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, I'll take you home," James said, disregarding the gunshot wound on his shoulder as he lifted Amelia up. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the force, the blood from his shoulder rolled down onto Amelia's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Put me down!" Amelia struggled to get down, afraid that he would be in pain. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But James lowered his head and kissed her forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be good, don't move," he said. "It will hurt if you struggle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll be in pain if you exert yourself," Amelia said, her eyes red from tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James' lips turned pale, but he smiled slightly. "If you don't struggle, I won't be in </span><span>pain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, moved by James' stubbornness, hugged his neck tightly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pressed her head against his chest, feeling his beating heart, and tears flowed uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, you're such a fool..." This fool was willing to do anything for her, even if it meant sacrificing his life. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James' love was so pure, and Amelia couldn't help but feel guilty. She hadn't treated him as well as he deserved, but this fool didn't mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these thoughts, Amelia raised her teary eyes and looked at him. "I worry about you, so please put me down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rarely expressed her concern for him, which made James' smile deepen. Amelia said, "I'm pregnant, and it's heavy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James replied, "Add one more, and your husband can carry them all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty walked out of the escape room and watched their retreating figures without trying to stop them. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't expect Amelia's forgiveness, and he silently watched them, as if seeing his past self and Sophia through them. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, when pregnant Sophia saw him seriously injured, she also worried about him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> Sophia must have loved him too, but fate played a cruel trick on them. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He killed Daley, and Sophia found out. She left with their child without hesitation. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before leaving, she hugged him and cried, saying that she had fallen in love with him and didn't want to leave him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of Sophia's painful breakup, Matty's aging eyes became misty. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until he couldn't see the figures in front of him clearly that he spoke with a low and remorseful voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will take care of the controlled manipulators, and no one from Erebus will seek revenge on you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James and Amelia heard it, but no one responded. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's remaining affection for him was gone because of Matty's threat. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, because of Matty, had a chip implanted in his brain, shortening his life. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Between the two of them, one lost affection, and the other still harbored hatred. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who would care about him? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the moment Erebus was attacked, Matty had already anticipated this ending. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a bit lonely, but it was inevitable. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't regain Amelia's friendship, so he could only find Master Davies, settle the score, and then... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty slowly lowered his eyelashes and looked at the blue tattoo on the back of his hand. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After it was all over, it was time for him to accompany her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the elevator in the corridor, Johnny, Holden, Emelyn, Andrew, Peter, and numerous members of S stood still. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They saw James shoot himself to save Amelia and atone for S's sins. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They admired James' courage and were deeply concerned for him. Fortunately, the </span><span>steel door of the biohazard area was blasted open. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had destroyed the door, causing the elevator passage to be blocked. It took them a long time to find the escape room. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, as soon as they came out, they saw James carrying Amelia, walking slowly out of the dark corridor. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Johnny saw Amelia nestled in James' arms, looking up at him, ignoring everything else around her, only staring at James, he knew that in this world, no one could replace James, at least not in Amelia's heart. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also knew that the gunshot James fired without hesitation was enough to prove how important Amelia was to him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the small sense of unwillingness in Johnny's heart gradually disappeared. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After making sure Amelia was safe, he raised his finger and waved to the people he had brought, then put his hands in his pockets and left gracefully.</span></p></div>
