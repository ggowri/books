        <h1>Chapter 1613 Go traveling</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia sat in the car and looked at the mansion. She felt that Stella was quite lonely, living alone in a big house without any servants or family. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought her aunt, who had treated her so well, was her closest person, but she turned out to be someone who had used her as a pawn since childhood. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought the man she should hate the most would treat her the worst, but the man named Erin actually loved her deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her closest person had ruined her and she had killed the man who loved her deeply with her own hands. Even though there were many people who cared about her, could she still feel anything in such despair? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia looked worriedly at James and said, "Honey, can I bring Grace and Eva to accompany Stella tomorrow?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James held her hand and played with it in his palm, then nodded, "Stella doesn't seem </span><span>to be in a normal state. Pay more attention to her mental condition." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't comfortable communicating with women, so he entrusted Amelia to do it, hoping that Stella could feel that there were still things worth remembering in this world. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking for a moment, Amelia held James' hand and placed it on her chest, slightly pouting, she asked, "Can I stay at Stella's house?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James raised his tender eyes and glanced at her, "How long do you want to stay?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia took advantage of the opportunity and said, "For a while..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The specific duration would depend on the situation. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James withdrew his hand and tapped her forehead, "No way." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia boldly approached him and said, "Honey, as long as you promise me, I'll do anything you want next time..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James refused to make empty promises, "You can let Eva or Grace stay at Stella's house, but you definitely can't." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing James' firm stance, Amelia didn't bother to plead with him anymore. She hummed and let go of his hand, turning her head to look out of the car window. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This annoyed expression made James couldn't help but curl his lips. He reached out and held Amelia's waist, pulling her onto his lap. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia thought he would relent, but instead he hugged her and kissed her. Amelia tried to struggle, but her man didn't give her a chance to catch her breath. Occasionally, even when they weren't doing anything, he would still kiss her for a long time, like on the way back, he had no intention of letting her go... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this time, Amelia stopped designing her sketches, and Eva stopped working the night shifts. They both came to accompany Stella with Grace, warming her heart in the most comforting way. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Stella still saw Erin. After being amused by Grace countless times, when Stella was smiling, she would see Erin covered in blood coming towards her... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many times, she would be in a daze until Grace grabbed her hand and said in her adorable voice, "Auntie, stop daydreaming and let's continue playing the game. This time, I will definitely beat you..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then could she snap out of her trance, but the next second, she would see Erin sitting across from her, playing games with them and holding a child, smiling at her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella felt her heart breaking, but she had to maintain a smile on her face. Only then would the people who loved her not worry about her, even if her heart was shattered... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt that she couldn't hold on any longer. After hesitating for a long time, Stella suggested going on a trip, leaving behind a beautiful and warm memory for her best friend. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The place they traveled to wasn't far, just a seaside city next door. The three women, along with a child, stayed by the beach. James and Paul followed from a distance to protect them, but they didn't interfere. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the early morning, Stella was the first to wake up and sat on the beach, watching the sunrise. She imagined Erin's ashes being scattered in the sea, whether it was at sunrise or sunset. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia opened the floor-length curtains and looked at Stella's lonely figure. Seagulls </span><span>occasionally flew by, and a gentle breeze lifted Stella's long hair and her ethereal dress. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia stared at Stella's back and felt that this figure was the most beautiful scenery in the world, but also something she couldn't hold on to. This thought made Amelia's heart race. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but try harder, do her best to be good to Stella, thinking that as long as she treated her well and made her feel warmth, Stella would have something worth remembering. But it's hard to keep someone with a mental problem... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Amelia only vaguely felt uneasy and didn't think in that direction, especially when she saw Stella running and laughing with Grace on the beach. She thought Stella was coming out to relax and would gradually get better... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella was very happy, taking many photos with Grace and leaving many videos with Amelia and Eva. The videos were mostly filled with smiles, and even someone as attentive as Amelia couldn't tell, let alone Eva. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone thought she was fine, especially after the trip, Stella returned to her normal work routine just like before.</span></p></div>
