        <h1>Chapter 1738 Emily set the trap</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Amelia felt a chill run down her spine and her whole body went cold. Even though Mr. Ben hadn't exposed James and their identities, there was still potential danger. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia steadied herself, pulled over, and turned to Johnny, "You just said Erebus is using James as a threat to lure me in, right?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny nodded. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia tightened her grip, "James told me before that Mr. Ben and Emily have a list of S members. Emily and I have some personal grievances. Could she be the one luring me in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny knew about Emily's history with James and said, "If she's the one luring you in, are you still going?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia wasn't concerned about her own safety, only about James. "If James is alive, will Emily use me to control him?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny thought for a moment and said, "If James is still alive, he hasn't returned, which means he's been controlled. Whether you go or not, Erebus can use you to control James. I think Emily is luring you in to seek revenge. So, regardless of whether James is alive or dead, she knows you'll go for him, which is why she sent you the golden leaf." Amelia realized that Emily was targeting her. She couldn't make </span><span>sense of how Emily got involved with Erebus after Mr. Ben joined them. The only thing she needed to be sure of was her decision. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny, seeing her silent, said, "You stole her fianc&eacute;. If you go, she will definitely use Erebus to kill you. You better not go." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, gripping the steering wheel, instinctively pushed back, "They were not engaged before, I didn't steal her fianc&eacute;. And didn't you say Erebus doesn't kill indiscriminately?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny calmly said, "It depends on what kind of level Emily has in Erebus with the list of S members. But according to Holden's description, Erebus is a place that strictly follows rules. If you don't make a wrong move during the game, she won't be able to touch you. But James may already be dead. Are you really going to take the risk for the unknown?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia asked him, "What about you? You saw Zack's broken bones and learned the truth of how Zack died from Holden, yet you still want to go with me. Isn't that also taking a risk for the unknown?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny's eyes flickered, but he remained silent. Zack was already dead, he knew that, but he still wanted to go and tell Gigi himself. Of course, to a large extent, it was because... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny's gaze, almost imperceptibly, swept over Amelia's face, his eyes inscrutable. When he remained silent, Amelia's gentle voice came to his ear, "You know, James and I have been through a lot to be together. We both cherish each other. Now, the person I love has disappeared, and I've even heard news of his death. I can't just sit at home and wait because I've been waiting for him for too long." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been waiting for him since I fell in love with him. At first, I waited for him to say he loved me, then I waited for him to marry me, and then I waited for him to come home. Now I have to wait to see if he will come back alive. Do you think I can keep waiting, especially since... I've already waited for over three months." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tone was calm, but her words were filled with helplessness and sadness. For Johnny, it sounded uncomfortable, but he didn't respond, just slightly tightened the fingers on his knee. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, whether Emily wants to harm me or not, I have to go. I believe Erebus follows rules, and I believe my luck will turn around. After all, I've been unlucky enough in the first half of my life. If fate wants me to continue being unlucky, then I want to die in a Then I'm going to die where he is, because this time, I don't want to wait.&rdquo;</span></p></div>
