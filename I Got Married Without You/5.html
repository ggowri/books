        <h1>Chapter 5 Emily's Substitute</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After exchanging pleasantries, Emily took James's arm and followed Lily to the CEO&rsquo;s office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Bella craned her neck and looked at their backs with envy. "Mr. Evans personally picked her up and escorted her on her first day of work? That HAS to mean he still loves her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Olivia patted her shoulder and said, "It&rsquo;s not just that. She&rsquo;s only just returned to the country and she&rsquo;s already taking over as CEO, so the old shareholders may not be completely convinced she&rsquo;s up to the task. By personally escorting her on her first day, Mr. Evans is warning everyone that she has the backing of the Evans Group!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"He&rsquo;s so quick to show his love and support for her. Mr. Evans really is the perfect man." Bella cupped her hand on her chin and sighed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Olivia's eyes were also full of jealousy. "If she weren't the chairman's daughter, she wouldn't have been chosen by the most powerful man inArcadia," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Bella shook her head disapprovingly. "Don&rsquo;t think so. Ms. Moore is accomplished too. She&rsquo;s highly educated and classy, and obviously she also looks beautiful . Speaking of her looks..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Bella looked at Amelia and continued, &ldquo;Amelia&hellip; don&rsquo;t you think you look kind of similar to our new CEO?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Olivia also came over to take a close look. "Jesus&hellip; you do look a bit like her, Amelia. But honestly I think you&rsquo;re way prettier!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Don't be ridiculous," Amelia said abruptly, and then she got up and went to the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What's up with her?" Bella looked at Amelia's thin back and asked worriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Olivia sneered and said, &ldquo;Maybe she&rsquo;s jealous because she thinks Emily is so much luckier than her, even though they practically have the same face!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Bella didn't continue. Olivia had always been two-faced, so it was better not to talk to her too much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Amelia entered the bathroom and quickly took out some medicine to relieve the pain in her heart. She was so anxious that she swallowed it down without drinking any water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After calming down for a few long moments, she turned on the faucet, splashed her face with cold water, and looked up at her reflection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was clear that Amelia&rsquo;s illness was ravaging her body, her cheeks sunken and her skin dull. &lsquo;But Emily&hellip;&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">While she was in a daze, the bathroom door opened, and in came Emily, her high heels clicking with each step.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her face was soft and delicate, with a rosy glow, and she exuded an effortless elegance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was like Bella said. She wasn&rsquo;t just beautiful. She was educated, classy, successful&hellip; Everything that Amelia was not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When her eyes met Emily's, she felt inferiority pierce through her chest. She quickly lowered her head, pulled out a tissue, and turned to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Wait a minute." Emily suddenly called out to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Amelia froze on the spot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She felt a strange sense of shame flow through her, after spending so many years as this woman&rsquo;s &ldquo;substitute&rdquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Emily walked up to her and smiled gently. " You&rsquo;re an assistant in the CEO's office, right? Was it &lsquo;Amelia?&rsquo;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Amelia tried to calm her pounding heart, lowered her head, and nodded at Emily. "Yes that&rsquo;s right, Ms. Moore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Nice to meet you again, Amelia.&rdquo; Emily raised the watch on her wrist, looked at the time, and said to her, "I'm going to hold a board meeting in half an hour. Can you make me a coffee and send it to my office? I need a little &lsquo;pick-me-up&rsquo;."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Amelia was a little hesitant. James was still in the president's office, after all. But she had not resigned yet, so she still had to do whatever Emily asked her to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Amelia had no choice but to nod, thinking she would ask Bella to bring the coffee in her place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Emily said, and walked out with her head held high, the textbook image of a CEO.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her confidence and brilliance were a stark contrast to Amelia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She felt as though she was like a counterfeit Emily. Useless, something to be discarded. Just like James did to her</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Amelia stood there motionless for a while before she collected herself, exited the bathroom, and went straight to the break room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She made a simple coffee and went to ask one of the others to send it to the CEO&rsquo;s office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, they had already been called to perform other tasks, so she had to bring it herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Amelia timidly knocked twice on the office door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Come in please." Emily's gentle voice came from inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After taking a deep breath, she summoned the courage to open the door and enter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When she opened the door, she saw Emily sitting on James's lap.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although she was mentally prepared to see James, she hadn&rsquo;t expected this sight. Her hands trembled, and she struggled not to spill the coffee all over the floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Afraid that the two of them would notice her discomfort, she quickly lowered her eyes and pretended as if nothing was wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Ms. Moore, here is your coffee."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Emily was a little embarrassed and said to Amelia, "Just leave it here, thank you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Amelia nodded, put the coffee on Emily&rsquo;s desk, and turned to walk out. She didn't look at James once the whole time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After leaving the CEO&rsquo;s office, Amelia's legs buckled under her. She leaned against the wall to regain her balance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The way Emily sat so comfortably in his lap&hellip; It reminded Amelia of how James would position her in the same way, when they would have sex.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although the two didn't do anything explicit, Amelia's mind was flooded with images of them together before, moaning and grinding and loving each other. She imagined James&rsquo;s hands touching Emily&rsquo;s body while she sat in his lap, the same way that James had touched her first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But no&hellip; that wasn&rsquo;t correct. It wasn&rsquo;t her that James touched first. He had definitely made love to Emily in that position, and so many more, long before she ever came along.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Because she&hellip; was just his substitute lover.</p></div>
