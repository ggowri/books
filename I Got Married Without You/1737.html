        <h1>Chapter 1737 Erebus's rules</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next was the internal situation of Erebus. Johnny said that Erebus was extremely secretive and not everyone could enter. You needed to receive an invitation card from Erebus and go to the designated location in order to qualify to go in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, just because Erebus sent an invitation didn&rsquo;t mean you have to go. Some rich people and gamblers were curious and choose to go because, as Johnny put it, when you were rich, life felt meaningless and only mental stimulation brought joy. When you were poor, only endless wealth could satisfy you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for how the members of S infiltrated, it's because Erebus knew that most of the members of S came from noble families. They had sent out invitation cards to many of them a long time ago, just to randomly find members of S. Those who received the invitation card could go to the designated location at any time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Members like James, Holden, and Zack were the targets Erebus was interested in, and they had received invitation cards a long time ago. However, they didn't pay much attention to it until the massacre happened. S, including Master Davies, didn't know the true purpose of Erebus until then. They only knew it was a place for the entertainment of the rich and gamblers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the rich, gamblers, or infiltrators accepted the invitation, Erebus would secretly observe them for a long time at the designated location. Once Erebus determined that the invitee was okay, they would secretly drug them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once inside, the invitees would usually be in an empty room controlled by electronic </span><span>devices, with no one appearing, even during the life and death games. However, Holden said that during the final round, the men in black would appear and take away the losers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the game starts, a mechanical voice would explain the rules and winning mechanism of the game. After that, the invitees could choose to leave or stay. Those who chose to stay had to follow Erebus's requirements, but Erebus wouldn't randomly kill them. Only the losers would face cruel punishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The game was divided into different areas, and the invitees had the freedom to choose. But once they chose an area, they had to complete all the games inside. If the losers managed to survive in the game from the first round to the last, they could continue to complete the remaining games. Usually, very few people could make it to the final round.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The survivors would be forced to sign an agreement not to disclose any information, or they would be assassinated. This was why the members of S didn't know the true purpose of Erebus before the massacre. The winners who survived and were sent out were also drugged, so no one knew where Erebus was located.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holden told Johnny all this because he was a member of S, and his mission was to expose the mastermind behind Erebus. When he failed, he pinned his hopes on Johnny, the vice president of the Eurasian Union, hoping that Johnny could do something after getting information from Erebus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, there was a difference in treatment between the members of S and the rich gamblers. When the rich gamblers lost the game, they received punishment according to the rules. But the members of S who infiltrated as rich gamblers, if discovered by Erebus, would be taken for biochemical experiments. If successful, they would be locked up, and if not, they would be dismembered.</span></p></div>
