        <h1>Chapter 1929 James collapsed in the snow</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He prayed to the gods and Buddhas, offering his life in exchange for Amelia's.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, instead of taking his life, the gods and Buddhas had taken away Amelia's memories, waking her up. It was a profitable deal.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he tried to console himself with this thought, James couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like everything he had experienced in the past decade was nothing but a futile dream...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Amelia's thin and exhausted face, her bloodshot eyes, and her bitter smile, Amelia's heart tightened uncomfortably.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought it was her heart causing the discomfort and pressed her hand against it. The strange pain quickly dissipated.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Ryan took the opportunity to release her other hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, your husband is back. Talk to him. I'll leave now and come back to see you another day."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anxious, Amelia called out to Ryan, stopping him in his tracks. "Ryan, don't leave. I don't know him. Leave me alone, I'm scared."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, still maintaining his position on the hospital bed, remained silent for a long time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lowered his thick eyelashes, looking at the woman beneath him, filled with fear. "Are you scared of me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia wasn't scared of him, but rather the unfamiliar feeling.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she didn't know how to express it, so she chose to remain silent and even directed her pleading eyes towards Ryan.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James had never witnessed how much she loved Ryan before. He had only heard her call his name in her sleep.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, seeing it with his own eyes, James suddenly lost all his faith.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clenched his fingers on the bedsheet, digging his nails into his skin until they drew blood.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suppressing the pain, he slowly straightened his body...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling embarrassed and hopeless, James looked at Ryan. "Since she's scared of me, you should stay and accompany her. I... will leave."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he said these words, his eyes suddenly became moist.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps afraid of being seen, James forced his aching knees to support his unsteady body, leaned against the wall, and turned to leave.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching his faltering figure, Amelia's heart ached once again. This time, she could deeply feel that it was hurting for James. But...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked up at Ryan, who had a heavy expression, and felt that her intuition was correct.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could be sure that she loved Ryan, and she couldn't regress along with her memories, right?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia couldn't understand. Her nerves were splitting apart. "Ryan, can you tell me what exactly happened between me and him?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan withdrew his gaze and looked at Amelia, who was full of confusion. "The things between you and him can't be explained in just a few words. But you love him very much. You're willing to risk your life for him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Amelia couldn't believe it, she didn't refute Ryan's words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She only said, "I don't feel love for him now. I only feel that I love you. So, Ryan, no matter what the reason is for our separation, as long as you haven't let go of me, we still have a chance to start over."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man leaning against the wall outside the hospital room heard these words. His exhausted body, worn out from days of hard work, trembled uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James had rushed into the hospital without even putting on his coat, braving the wind and snow, only to find out...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia had forgotten about him. She only remembered Ryan and loved Ryan.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what about their Mr. Evans? Would their years of love be reduced to nothing because of a bout of amnesia?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the room, Ryan pulled out a chair in front of the hospital bed, seemingly wanting to say something to Amelia.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But James no longer had the mood to listen. He lifted his painful and unsteady steps, swaying as he walked out of the hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew and Peter wanted to follow, but James raised his hand, and they understood that he wanted some time alone. They stopped in their tracks.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, enduring the pain that was about to shatter his body, leaned against the wall and walked away step by step.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stumbled out of the hospital. The snow outside was heavier than before, covering the cold ground in an instant...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing at the hospital entrance, he looked up at the snowflakes falling from the sky and suddenly felt an overwhelming sense of loneliness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This loneliness emanated from within, making it unbearable for him. His vision went black...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tall and upright figure collapsed onto the snowy ground.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pure white snow, like reed flowers, fluttered and fell, melting bit by bit on the man's flawless face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he was only wearing a thin suit and shirt, he couldn't feel the slightest coldness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps his heart was already cold enough, so the physical coldness was insignificant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before his consciousness completely dissipated, he stared intently at the falling snow and said in his heart, "Amelia, I can't hold on anymore. If you remember me and I'm no longer here, please don't blame me..."</span></p></div>
