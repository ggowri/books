        <h1>Chapter 1211 This matter, you should always keep it to yourself!</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella, wearing a white coat, wanted to deceive James, but when she touched his cold eyes, she wisely abandoned the idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The report is true. You have no blood relation with Amelia. So, it was pointless for you to ask me to falsify the report."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James breathed a sigh of relief at Stella's words, and his tense nerves relaxed in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tall and straight back leaned against the sofa, and his face, which had been pale for two consecutive days, gradually regained its rosy color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him looking relieved, Stella smiled again and said, "James, if I accidentally let something slip while chatting with Amelia..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James' cold, snowy eyes suddenly lifted, "Pick any of the twelve villas in the east of the city. This matter will stay with you forever!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't want Amelia to know about his despicable methods. Otherwise, the image of a good husband that he had worked so hard to build in her heart would be completely destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella laughed out loud this time, "You're really willing to go all out for Amelia. But I have a criminal record. Even if I accept the villa, I might still blabber."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Criminal record...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James quickly realized that Stella was trying to oppose him today because he had 'tested' her in the laboratory earlier. However, he said, "The evidence of your falsifying the report is solid. There's no way to wash it away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>S</span><span>tella</span><span>: ...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>J</span><span>ames</span><span> didn't bother to see S</span><span>tella</span><span>'s reaction and left after saying this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If J</span><span>ames</span><span> and A</span><span>melia</span><span> were not related by blood, then who was the person that the C</span><span>lark</span><span> family had adopted as their mother?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the DNA test report came out, James took Amelia back to Evans' old mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dominic was sitting in the living room, making tea. When he saw the two of them come in hand in hand, his face turned black and he threw the tea cup heavily on the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have the nerve to come here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dominic was referring to Amelia. She glanced at the old man but didn't say anything. James, on the other hand, walked straight up to Dominic with Amelia in tow and threw the report at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Read it yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James' attitude towards the old man had always been cold and indifferent, and Dominic was used to it. He took back his disdainful gaze at Amelia and picked up the report.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw the results displayed on it, the old man's gloomy expression softened slightly, but it was fleeting and was soon replaced by a look of suspicion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could this be a fake report?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After flipping through it a few times, the old man threw it back on the table and looked up at James. "The hospital is yours. It wouldn't be difficult for a doctor to </span><span>produce a fake report."</span></p></div>
