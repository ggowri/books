        <h1>Chapter 1683 One more time</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When James made love, he was strong but also understood how to take care of her feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought it would be a one-time thing, but little did she know that James went crazy and it happened again and again until she couldn't take it anymore and he carried her to the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James used to be cold and ungentle before, but ever since they got married, he became tender and even took it upon himself to personally wash her in the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Amelia watched James carefully washing her hair, her heart filled with love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, you said you would tell me as soon as we were done, why didn't you?" she </span><span>asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James paused his fingers slowly and seemed to be weighing something in his mind. In the end, he didn't say anything and only said, "Paul sent two messages, which one do you want to hear first?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would tell her before they left, telling her now would only cause panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, enjoying the service from her husband, closed her eyes in comfort. "Either one is fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James leaned down and kissed her forehead before softly saying, "First, he won back Ms. Miller and they got married."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this news, Amelia was shocked and opened her eyes wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paul and Eva got married, when did this happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Amelia's surprised expression, James smirked and revealed a faint smile of indulgence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yesterday."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia quickly sat up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to ask her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But James stretched out his long fingers and pushed her back into place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's another message I haven't told you yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia laid back in the bathtub, using her eyes to urge James to speak quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In ten months, Paul is going to be a father."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia blinked her eyes twice, still not processing the information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's going to be a father, what does that have to do with marrying Eva?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia said this with disbelief, her eyes wide open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that Eva is pregnant?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a smile on his lips, James nodded lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took Amelia a while to come back to her senses and she took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder they got married so quickly, it turns out Eva is pregnant..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After muttering to herself, she seemed to think of something and looked up at James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> he was stimulated by Paul and hurried back in a panic?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Amelia lowered her long eyelashes and looked at her own belly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing her emotions, James quickly lifted her out of the water and held her sitting on his lap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Babe, don't worry, we don't have a child and it's okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he wanted to give her something to hold onto, not being able to have children was also okay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyway, he would always keep his lifelong promise, come back safely, and accompany her for the rest of their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia saw the concern and love in his eyes and knew that he truly didn't mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she could feel that James also wanted a child, even if he didn't want to, he would be influenced by the people around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised her delicate white hand, cupped James' extraordinarily handsome face, then lowered her head and deeply kissed his thin lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, let's do it again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was afraid that her body couldn't handle it, but Amelia didn't care and reached </span><span>out to embrace him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She buried her head in his neck, like a little cat, and kissed his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The touch of her red lips on his skin made James's abdomen tighten, and then a wave of excitement arose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, are you done?" Amelia whispered in his ear when she saw him pretending not to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to resist, James grabbed her slender waist and pressed her down forcefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two hours later, James lifted Amelia's chin and looked at her teary eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you satisfied?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blushing, Amelia lowered her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're...so good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After being taken care of by James, Amelia went downstairs and let Frank make </span><span>a</span><span> herbal medicine for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She obediently drank the medicine for the night, and by then, it was already dark outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had wanted to go find Eva or call her to ask when she got pregnant, but considering that the newlyweds were probably busy getting to know each other, she decided not to disturb them for now.</span></p></div>
