        <h1>Chapter 1766 Amelia Bit James</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The emotions in her eyes were colder than ever, as if she was utterly disappointed in him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that look, James understood that if he nodded, it meant he would lose her forever. Because he had hurt her in the same way before, and it took them many years to come back together. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, if it happened again, she wouldn't give him a second chance, no matter </span><span>what the reason was. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't want to lose her and was afraid of her being with someone else, but compared to her life and their child, her leaving him seemed insignificant at that moment. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slowly released his clenched fists and nodded gently at Amelia. When she got his answer, Amelia couldn't describe the feeling, she just forced a faint smile. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If James had said he only touched Emily because he was drunk, she might have believed it was a mistake. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when he admitted to loving Emily, Amelia knew he had never touched her. James loved her so much, even enough to sacrifice his life for her, so how could he fall in love with someone else in just a few days? There must have been a reason. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Amelia couldn't accept this, it was too hurtful. She had been like a fool, enduring the pain caused by his reasons over and over again. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had tried to keep him, given him a chance to explain, and even expressed that she would stand by him, but James had remained silent, so she didn't need to stay here anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly took the pen that was clipped to the divorce agreement, signed her name, and threw the agreement at James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she raised her eyes, filled with coldness, and looked at him. "This is your last chance. If you tear up this agreement, I'll be waiting for you at home. If you don't, I will never see you again, even if I die." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The excruciating pain spread from his fingertips, making him limbs ache, not to mention the constant stimulation of his brain by the pain receptors. But James endured it, standing in front of Amelia, silent. His attitude was his answer, and Amelia no longer had any hope for him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned and walked into the house, but at the moment she stepped in, she turned back and looked at James, whose eyes were bloodshot. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stayed in place for two seconds, then suddenly turned around, rushed over, raised her tiptoes, tore open his collar, and bit his shoulder with all her strength, not letting go even when she drew blood. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James frowned slightly, but he didn't push her away, and even tightened his fingers behind her, as if he would hold her tighter if she stopped biting. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia bit and cried until she felt her teeth sink into his bone, then slowly let go. "I was afraid of hurting you before, so I didn't sign. But this time, I did." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When James heard this, he understood why she had bitten him. He had promised her that he would never love anyone else and had let her bite his shoulder. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now he said he loved someone else. Amelia was telling him that he had broken his promise and that she didn't believe he loved someone else. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was also letting him know that she wasn't afraid of hurting him anymore, because she wouldn't forgive him again. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James couldn't bear it anymore and wanted to grab Amelia's hand, but she pushed him away, turned around, and walked into the house. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the door closed, Amelia spoke coldly again. "Is Zack still alive?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, who had wanted to grab her, heard this and instantly remembered the image of </span><span>Zack being bitten by a snake. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He almost lost his mind. One person had already died, and he couldn't let her die in front of him as well. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, James restrained his overwhelming emotions, stopped in his tracks, and let his powerless hand fall, looking at Amelia, who was staring coldly at him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The broken bone that Holden brought back belongs to Zack." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's heart skipped a beat, even though she had already guessed the result, she still couldn't control herself when she heard that Zack had died. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She came here to find James, and confirm Zack's death, but ended up causing </span><span>Johnny</span><span>'s death as well, and divorcing James. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything had an answer, but she could never face Gigi again. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she lowered her eyes, the door suddenly closed, sliding down quickly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the thick glass, she looked up, took one last look at James, and in that moment, the tall figure in her memory passed by, leaving nothing but white in her sight.</span></p></div>
