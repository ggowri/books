        <h1>Chapter 1623 Cherishing life</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew was seeking revenge while Amelia was struggling to sleep after losing her friend. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time she dreamed at midnights, Stella's face appeared vividly in her mind. They said that after someone died, their presence and appearance in our memories gradually faded until they became blurry and forgotten. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Amelia didn&rsquo;t want to forget Stella. She looked at her photos every day and dreamed about her, over and over again, until she fell ill. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, worried about her, stayed by her sickbed, staring at her pale face. He asked her, "What will I do if you get worse?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, understanding Stella's love now, realized that she would follow James if anything were to happen to him. Love went deep, like a moth to a flame. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After this realization, she reached out and touches James' tired face, apologizing for causing him worry. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James shook his head gently and went to get her a bowl of pumpkin congee that Frank made. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia ate it after struggling to sit up and mentions that Hugh said he would give her an IV drip. James reassured her that he would take care of everything and told her to rest. Amelia agreed and finished the congee before lying back down with James taking care of her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She believed that only when she moved on from Stella's dreams, could James be truly okay. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought that Stella's departure taught everyone the importance of cherishing life rather than sinking into sorrow. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following Stella's last words, Amelia dutifully took medicine every day, no matter how bitter, in hopes of conceiving a child so that Stella could be the godmother. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Eva drowned her sorrows in alcohol, getting drunk several times at nightclubs. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she was drunk, she held her phone and repeatedly called Stella, wondering why she never answered. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, who was with her, couldn&rsquo;t stand it anymore and took her phone away, telling her that Stella was no longer here to answer. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Drunk Eva, not wanting to hear this, tried to take the phone back but failed because Paul was taller. She ended up accidentally falling into his arms. She was drunk, but Paul was not. As he held her, his Adam's apple moved slightly, and he tried to act like a gentleman, reaching out to help Eva up. However, she suddenly jumped up and snatched the phone back, hitting Paul in the face with a slap. Paul winced in pain and furrowed his brows. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, oblivious to what she just did, crouched in a corner, angrily trying to unlock the phone. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her in that state, Paul's anger subsided a bit. He touched his sore cheek and walked over to Eva, unlocking the phone with ease. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva, surprised at how easily he unlocked it, thanked him with a smile. Paul, unsure of his own intentions, grabbed Eva's wrist and pulls her into his embrace, saying that </span><span>actions speak louder than words.</span></p></div>
