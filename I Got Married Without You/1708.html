        <h1>Chapter 1708 What is your relationship with Mr. Evans?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty didn't ask further when he saw that Amelia seemed unsure. Instead, he walked around the desk, sat down on a chair, and looked at Amelia across from him while holding his coffee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss Clark, I want to build an estate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally getting to the point, Amelia quickly grabbed her notebook and pen, ready to take notes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lawrence, please go on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Based on the description from his old friend in his memory, Matty slowly told Amelia...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A white cottage with a garden filled with tulips. Under an arched bridge, there is a fish pond with goldfish swimming around. And in the backyard, there will be fruit trees..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing this, Amelia thought it was going to be a challenging commercial building to design, but she didn't expect it to be such a simple family residence. She found it a bit strange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lawrence, an ordinary designer can handle this kind of project. Why did you specifically choose me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan took another sip of coffee and said, "My young lover once told me that if she had a daughter, she would build a house like this for her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about your daughter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't have a daughter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matty thought for a moment. If Sumasa were still alive, she would probably look like their daughter with Sophia. After thinking about it, Matty couldn't help but observe Amelia again. The woman in front of him also resembled Sumasa, just not as much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia wanted to ask why Matty would build such a house if his first love didn't have </span><span>a daughter. Was it to make up for the regret? But then she realized that everyone has their own story. As an outsider, she should just design according to the employer's request and not ask too many questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, she didn't say anything more, and Matty didn't reveal any more about his past. After a moment of silence between them, Amelia put away her notebook.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, Mr. Lawrence, I'll go find Dylan and have him take me to survey the construction site. I won't bother you any longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kind of task would naturally be Dylan's responsibility, so there was no need to ask Matty. However, Matty stopped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The site is right next to us. I'll take you there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia was a bit surprised that Matty would personally take her there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They entered from the backyard and crossed several lawns until they arrived at a barren land with an orchard. Matty pointed at the land and told Amelia what style he wanted and how big the building should be. Amelia noted everything down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing the important matters, Matty stared at her for a while and then suggested that she and Neil stay for dinner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia declined, worried that James might be waiting impatiently. "Mr. Lawrence, maybe next time. I have some other things to attend to today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a few seconds of silence, Matty nodded slightly. "Since you're busy, then until next time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There probably wouldn't be a next time. Once the design drawings were done, she would just have Neil send them to Dylan. However, Amelia didn't say that and bid a polite farewell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She returned from the backyard feeling relaxed, and Neil, who had been anxious, finally relaxed when he saw that Dylan was still there. He didn't interrogate Amelia about the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After handing over the notebook to Neil, Amelia greeted Dylan, "Dylan, I'm done talking with your grandfather. When the drawings are ready, I'll have my assistant send them to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he replied with a "good," Dylan looked at her thoughtfully and asked, "Miss Clark, if you don't mind me asking, what is your relationship with Mr. Evans?"</span></p></div>
