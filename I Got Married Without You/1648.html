        <h1>Chapter 1648 The doghouse</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Edith left, James put down the pen he was signing the documents with, elegantly stood up, grabbed his coat, and instructed the driver to take him to Eric's house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as his tall and upright figure entered the living room, a plate flew towards him, but James quickly dodged it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The plate flew past him and smashed against the wall behind him, instantly shattering into pieces...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the broken pieces on the floor and the messy living room, James raised an eyebrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rarely came to Eric's house, but in his memory, Eric's house was always clean and tidy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, there was no trace of cleanliness and orderliness anywhere he looked. It was just like the doghouse Grace built in the backyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate and Eric, who were still arguing with Paul, quickly put away their angry expressions when they saw James and went to greet him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, why are you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James glanced at Paul, who had a resentful look on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have some business to discuss with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate thought James was here as Paul's savior. Hearing James' words, she breathed a sigh of relief. She didn't want James to interfere in their affairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then you can talk in the study. I'll make you some coffee..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James nodded slightly and gestured for Paul to come with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only a short while later, Kate knocked on the door while holding coffee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"James, I don't know what kind of coffee you like, so I picked one according to Paul's taste. Try it, and if you don't like it, I'll get you a different one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing the imposing James, Kate spoke much more politely, as if James were her son, showing a gentleness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although James rarely ate casually outside, he politely picked up the coffee and took a sip in response to Kate's enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, the taste was poor, but he still said politely, nodding to Kate, "The coffee is </span><span>not bad. Thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Kate's gloomy mood instantly improved. "Then you can drink coffee and talk. I'll go order food."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want to cook herself, afraid that she would ruin the food for James. It was better to order from a hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With James present, she could go order food without worrying about Paul's objections. She couldn't embarrass herself in front of the person in power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking this, Kate immediately turned around, but James stopped her. "Kate, I need to talk to you about something."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate turned back, feeling a bit surprised, and pointed at herself. "Me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man exuding indifference raised his cold gaze and blinked his eyes gently. "Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing something in his eyes, Kate glanced at Paul sitting next to her. It seemed that she was here to help this jerk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking for a moment, Kate still sat down opposite him. She wanted to see how James would convince her to apologize to Eva.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sitting down, James looked at Paul, and with just a glance, Paul understood and got up to give them some space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Paul left the room, James calmly turned his gaze to Kate. "Kate, you should be well aware that Ms. Miller is my wife's sister, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kate thought James would kindly persuade her, but she didn't expect him to come straight to hold her accountable. Her heart skipped a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She opened her mouth, wanting to find an excuse, but James didn't give her the chance. He coldly said, "You are my uncle's wife, Ms. Miller is my wife's sister. In my eyes, who is more important, I don't think I need to remind you, do I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing James being impolite, Kate maintained her gentle expression, but her tone turned cold. "James, if you speak like this, you're underestimating your uncle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James smirked, a cold smile emerging from his lips. "Kate, you knew that Ms. Miller is my wife's sister, yet you went to her and said slanderous things. Doesn't that mean you don't take me seriously either?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a single mention of "Ms. Miller is his wife's sister," Eva's status and position were instantly elevated, making Kate, who despised Eva for her lack of background, feel embarrassed.</span></p></div>
