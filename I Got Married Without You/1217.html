        <h1>Chapter 1217 Jonny’s excuse sucks (1)</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb reached out to grab his own hair, but James immediately signaled to Andrew beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Receiving the signal, Andrew acted first and grabbed Herb's hair, saying "Let me do it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for Herb's consent, Andrew pulled hard on his hair and instantly pulled out a large clump.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb held his head in pain and screamed, "Are you crazy?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew apologized with a smile, "Sorry, I used too much force..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was that just a little too much force?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb could confidently say that if his skull wasn't so strong, Andrew would have pulled his brainstem out just now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Herb in pain, Amelia felt sorry for him and said, "Well, if there's nothing else, I'll go do the appraisal first..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herb nodded in pain, "Sis, remember to contact me as soon as the report is out..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia agreed, but as she was about to get up, she saw a figure rushing over like a gust of wind and said urgently, "James, there's an emergency, come out with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James raised his double eyelids slightly, unhurriedly glancing at the anxious Jonny, "If you want me to go out, I'll go out. Why should I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonny hated J</span><span>ames&rsquo;</span><span> high and mighty attitude, but had to grit his teeth and endure, "It's related to you, otherwise would I come find you?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>J</span><span>ames</span><span> sneered, "If I remember correctly, we have a relationship of mutual hatred. If what you're saying is really related to me, you'd be the first to want me in trouble and wouldn't come find me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was not wrong, J</span><span>ames</span><span> was the last person Jonny wanted to help, but it wasn't appropriate to say that now, "Fine, if you don't want to go out, forget it. Anyway, Jocelyn will take your wife's niece away later, don't blame me for not reminding you."</span></p></div>
