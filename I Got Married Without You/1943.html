        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia smiled and said, "Eva just came up with a name for the baby, but he didn't like it and started crying and kicking his legs. I thought something was wrong and was about to call the doctor, but then Eva suggested changing the name, and he stopped crying..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James leaned forward, supporting himself with one hand on the hospital bed, and looked down at the baby in Amelia's arms. "What name was it that made him react like that?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adam."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the name was mentioned, the baby started crying and kicking his legs again, clearly expressing his dislike for the name.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was evident that the name was even worse to him than "Buzz Lightyear."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva quickly reached out and patted the baby's tummy, trying to soothe him. "Alright, alright, we won't use that name. We'll come up with a new one that sounds even better..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James started suggesting names, and every time he mentioned one, the baby would cry and kick his legs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, the baby seemed to have cried himself out and stopped crying, but he was still fuming, glaring at his own legs and waving his little fists as if he were cursing with some foul language...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia and Eva were stunned, while James extended a finger and lightly tapped the baby's cheek. "It seems like... this little guy won't be easy to deal with when he grows up."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The baby didn't like James touching him and turned his head away, avoiding his finger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span> It was normal for a baby to turn away when being touched, but as he turned his head, he seemed to let out a little grunt.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James's expression changed slightly upon hearing the grunt, but Amelia laughed. "Well, it's your fault for randomly picking a name for him. Now you've offended him, haven't you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James stared at the baby for a couple of seconds, not taking him seriously. "Since he doesn't want me to choose a name, then let him pick one himself."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if understanding what was being said, the baby happily extended his little arms towards James, wanting to be held by him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James glanced at him. "He won't let me choose a name, but he wants me to hold him? Dream on."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia: ...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva: ...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Amelia woke up from her coma, she spent a few months recovering before finally leaving the hospital and returning to the Blue Bay Island.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't want the baby to stay in the hospital due to the high risk of bacteria, so Paul and Eva took care of him during that time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia and James initially wanted Frank to take the baby home and have a nanny look after him, but the baby had gotten used to Paul and Eva and didn't let anyone else touch him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva was happy to take care of Buzz Lightyear and occasionally brought him to the hospital for Amelia and James to see.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this time, Amelia noticed that the baby was exceptionally intelligent, especially on the day they had to choose gifts and a name.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had to choose twice, once for the Evans family and Lawrence family gifts, which included Neil and George's contributions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere was lively on that day. The garden on the Blue Bay Island was beautifully decorated, with a red carpet leading from the stairs to the entrance. The trees were adorned with lights, and luxury cars were parked outside, with relatives dressed </span><span>in formal attire arriving one after another.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank warmly welcomed the guests, and the servants took care of the running children.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia and Eva each held the baby, waiting for Neil and George to set up the gifts.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because Amelia's baby was premature and close in age to Eva's baby, Paul suggested that the three children choose gifts together, starting with his own children.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't argue with Paul and was mainly interested in seeing what gifts Paul's children would choose.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul preferred girls, so when Neil finished setting up all the items on the red carpet, he took the baby girl from Eva's arms and placed her on the blanket, gently stroking her head.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Margot, go for it and grab that world classic..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted his daughter to read more books and have the highest education in the Evans family, so he kept encouraging Margot to choose a book.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Margot crawled on the ground for a while and finally reached the edge of the red carpet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With cameras flashing, she targeted a stack of money and quickly and accurately grabbed it with her little hand.</span></p></div>
