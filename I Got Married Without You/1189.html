        <h1>Chapter 1189 Secret</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dominic was shocked and looked at James, "You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James closed his eyes and didn't want to talk anymore, "Get out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dominic sat stiffly in place, staring at the man in front of him, "If you don't agree to the divorce, then I can't handle the fact that you have half of Clark's family blood."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason why Carol agreed to keep the secret back then was because Dominic gave her 10% of the shares. Now that James has taken back half of those shares, she will definitely not be willing. If she finds out that James is not getting a divorce and not dealing with Amelia, she will definitely expose everything. What will James do in Evans's family then?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In order to prevent James from following in his father's footsteps, Dominic can also listen to Paul's advice and temporarily put aside the feud between the Clark and Evans families. But he cannot ignore the ethical issues. If this is exposed and spread, won't it become a big joke?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition, if these two people have children in the future, the children will not be healthy. They cannot be together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But James said that even if Amelia was his own sister, they should also be together. This is really crazy, even more uncontrollable than his father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dominic sat stiffly, waiting for a response from James, but he remained silent and seemed completely indifferent to these things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He helplessly stood up and walked to the door, but stopped and looked back at James, "You should think about it carefully."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia and Paul sitting in the living room saw Dominic walking out with a calm face, and guessed that their conversation was not pleasant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dominic looked exhausted and walked unsteadily. Paul quickly stood up and went to support him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, what's wrong with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dominic raised his hand and waved it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was obvious that he didn't want him to know what the secret was, and Paul tactfully didn't ask again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let me take you back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dominic nodded and left Blue Bay Island with P</span><span>aul</span><span>'s support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After watching the two leave, A</span><span>melia</span><span> held her arm that had been treated and walked into the study.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing J</span><span>ames</span><span> lying on the sofa, looking lifeless, she felt a tightness in her heart and walked over quickly. "Honey, what's wrong with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing her voice, J</span><span>ames</span><span> slowly opened his eyes and looked at her arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached out and pulled her to sit down on the sofa, and touched her arm. "What did S</span><span>tella</span><span> say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A truthfully said, "S</span><span>tella</span><span> said the bones are fine, it's just a flesh wound. It will be fine after applying medicine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>J</span><span>ames</span><span> finally relaxed, "If you feel uncomfortable, you should tell me in time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A</span><span>melia</span><span> nodded and saw that he looked pale, so she asked worriedly, "Honey, are you okay?"</span></p></div>
