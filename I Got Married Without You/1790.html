        <h1>Chapter 1790 Hurting her the same way twice</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny shook his head. "I asked him to go to the deserted island."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny thought that if Amelia could come out, she would also appear there. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first thing he did when he opened his eyes was to ask Samuel to send someone to guard the deserted island to see if they could find her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, it didn't take long for Samuel to discover Amelia on the beach of the deserted island. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But my father said that when he found you, you were all wet, as if you had been in the sea." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He didn't know who pulled you out of the sea, only that the person who rescued you saved you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's why her child was able to be saved. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Amelia heard this, she was somewhat stunned. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no one else nearby who could have saved her in time, only Brandon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that he had a change of heart and came back to save her? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia didn't want to believe this possibility, but she felt it could only be him... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even if it was him, Amelia's resentment would not diminish. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could they have lived so miserably if it weren't for Brandon? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could she have been bullied by Emily if it weren't for Brandon? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of Emily forcing James to divorce her, she couldn't help but feel angry. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her clenching her fists and looking resentful, Johnny reached out and covered her hand. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your body hasn't fully recovered, don't get angry." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia then slowly suppressed her feelings of resentment and quietly moved Johnny's hand away. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny pretended not to care and picked up a glass of water from the bedside table, handing it to Amelia. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you find James later?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking the glass, Amelia hesitated for a moment. "I found him." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lowered her eyelashes and drank a sip of water without any emotion. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finding James should have made Amelia very happy, but at the moment she was not in high spirits. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no longer the passionate love in her eyes, and Johnny couldn't help but feel a little strange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened between you and him?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holding the cup, Amelia lowered her head. "He doesn't want me anymore." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she said this, a tear fell into the water glass. Johnny was stunned. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could that be?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear to everyone that James loved Amelia to the bone, so how could he not want her? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, Amelia would have kept her sadness to herself, but now she wiped away the tears from the corners of her eyes and smiled at Johnny. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He had no choice but to give me a divorce agreement and forced me to sign it." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny understood that James had his reasons for driving Amelia away. "Since he had no choice, it doesn't mean he doesn't want you." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia nodded slightly, looking out the window with a hint of sadness in her eyes. Johnny stared at Amelia, who remained silent, for a while before speaking again. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is he a player or a behind-the-scenes black-clothed man now?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia could find him in only two ways. "He's an inviter." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia raised her hand and pointed to her chest. "His clothes are marked with the letters and numbers of the Erebus inviter." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Erebus-Inviter-2-9, his level should be higher than that of the black-clothed men, right?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>2-9 was a number, indicating his rank as an Erebus partner, and indeed it was a high level. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was quite capable, as an undercover S, he had managed to climb to the position of partner. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Johnny." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone of his level can freely enter and leave Erebus, right?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny wasn't sure how James became an Erebus inviter, but he knew that someone of this level could indeed move freely and was not bound by Erebus. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hesitated to respond, and his silence was the best answer. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's eyelashes drooped again. "As long as he calls me within 23 days, I won't go looking for him, and..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia choked up and didn't finish her sentence. Johnny comforted her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He probably still has a mission to complete. When he's done, you can ask him about it." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's fingertip gently rubbed the rim of the cup. "When I signed the divorce agreement, I told him that I would never see him until I die." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny paused for a moment, his eyes revealing a sense of understanding. "Are you blaming him?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia nodded. "He hurt me in the same way twice." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was willing to accompany him to death, but she didn't want to be coldly pushed away by him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, James believed that doing so would protect her. She could understand him, but the pain in her heart was enough to bring her into a nightmare. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I only know that he had no choice, but I don't know the reasons behind it. Am I a </span><span>failure?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had died once before, and three years later, she finally understood why he had treated her that way. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought that after experiencing this, he wouldn't push her away again, but he remained as resolute as ever. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Amelia, who lacked a god's-eye view, all of James' unspoken grievances were a form of hurt. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, James didn't tell her anything, and many times, she felt like a fool, not knowing anything.</span></p></div>
